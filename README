The goal of the mwetoolkit is to perform automatic Multiword Expression 
extraction. Please read this documentation before you start the work.

    1) DOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITIONS

You will find three different DTD files that describe the format of the three
inputs of the MWT toolkit scripts:

* mwttoolkit-corpus.dtd
* mwttoolkit-dict.dtd
* mwttoolkit-candidates.dtd

    2) EXAMPLES

The "toy" folder contains a set of files for performing a toy experiment.
You could try to run the whole pipeline by calling "bash testAll.sh" The specific
documentation about the examples is in a dedicated README file.

    3) SCRIPTS

The "bin" folder contains a set of useful scripts that automatise part of the
MWT extraction process. Call each script with no parameter and you will have
a complete list of arguments and options to use.

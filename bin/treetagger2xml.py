"""
    This script transforms the output format of TreeTagger to the XML format of
    a corpus, as required by the mwetoolkit scripts. The script is language
    independent as it does not transform the information. You can chose either
    to use sentence splitting of the treetagger (default) or to keep the 
    original sentence splitting. In the latter case, you should add a sentence
    delimiter </s> at the end of each sentence before tagging the text. Only
    UTF-8 text is accepted.
    
    For more information, call the script with no parameter and read the
    usage instructions.

python %(program)s OPTIONS <files.xml>

OPTIONS may be:

-o OR --original-split
    Keep the original sentence splitting of the input file. If this option is
    activated, you should add a sentence delimiter "</s>" at the end of each
    sentence before feeding the text into treetagger. This tag will be ignored
    by the tagger and then used to retrieve the original sentence splitting. 
    This otpion is particularly useful when dealing with parellel corpora in 
    which the sentence alignment cannot be messed up by the tagger.

-s <sent> OR --sentence <sent>
    Name of the POS tag that the treetagger uses to separate sentences. Please,
    specify this if you're not using --original segmentation. Defaults to "SENT"
    which is the name of the tag used to indicate English sentence splitting.

    ATTENTION: when working in a language other than English, please specify one
    of the two options, -s or -o, otherwise the result may look like a corpus
    with a  single (very long) line.

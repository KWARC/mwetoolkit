            Instanciates a new `Word`. A Word might be one of: a token in a 
            corpus, in which case it will probably have at least a defined 
            surface form (mwttoolkit-corpus.dtd); a part of a pattern, in which
            case it will probably contain some `WILDCARD`s; a part of a 
            reference or gold standard entry, in which case it will have at 
            least a defined lemma (mwttoolkit-patterns.dtd); a part of an n-gram
            in a candidates list, in which case most of the parts should be
            defined (mwttoolkit-candidates.dtd). Besides the surface form, the
            lemma and the Part Of Speech tag, a word also contains a list of
            `Frequency`ies, each one corresponding to its number of occurrences 
            in a given corpus.
            
            @param surface A string corresponding to the surface form of the
            word, i.e. the form in which it occurs in the corpus. A surface form
            might include morphological inflection such as plural and gender
            marks, conjugation for verbs, etc. For example, "went", "going", 
            "go", "gone", are all different surface forms for a same lemma, the
            verb "(to) go".
            
            @param lemma A string corresponding to the lemma of the word, i.e.
            the normalized non-inflected form of the word. A lemma is generally
            the preferred simplest form of a word as it appears in a dictionary,
            like infinitive for verbs or singular for nouns. Notice that a lemma
            is a well formed linguistic word, and thus differs from a root or
            a stem. For example, the lemma of the noun "preprocessing" is
            "preprocessing" while the root (without prefixes and suffixes) is
            "process". Analagously, the lemma of the verb "studied" is "(to) 
            study" whereas a stem would be "stud-", which is not an English
            word.
            
            @param pos A string corresponding to a Part Of Speech tag of the 
            word. A POS tag is a morphosyntactic class like "Noun", "Adjective"
            or "Verb". You should use a POS tagger system to tag your corpus
            before you use mwttoolkit. The tag set, i.e. the set of valid POS
            tags, is your choice. You can use a very simple set that 
            distinguishes only top-level classes ("N", "A", "V") or a fine-
            grained classification, e.g. "NN" is a proper noun, "NNS" a proper
            noun in plural form, etc.

            @param syn A string corresponding to a syntax information of the
            word. AS the jungle of syntactic formalisms is wild, we assume that
            each word has a string that encodes the syntactic information. If
            you use a dependency parser, for instance, you might encode the
            syntax information as "rel:>index" where "rel" is the type of
            syntactic relation (object, subject, det, etc.) and the "index" is
            the index of the word on which this word depends. An example can be
            found in the corpus DTD file.
            
            @param freqs A list of `Frequency`ies corresponding to counts of 
            occurrences of this word in a certain corpus. Please notice that
            the frequencies correspond to occurrences of a SINGLE word in a 
            corpus. Joint `Ngram` frequencies are attached to the corresponding 
            `Ngram` object that contains this `Word`, if any.

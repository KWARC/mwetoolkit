   This script homogenises the case of a corpus. Two possible lowercasing 
   algorithms are proposed: simple and complex. The former lowercases 
   everything, regardless of acronyms, proper names, dates, etc. The latter 
   keeps the case of words that do not present a preferred form, i.e. words that 
   might occur uppercased even if they are not at the beginning of a sentence. 
   Some fuzzy thresholds are hardcoded and were fixed based on empirical 
   observation of the Genia corpus. Since you are supposed to perform 
   lowercasing before any linguistic processing, this script operates on surface 
   forms. Any lemma information will be ignored during lowercasing, except you
   use -l option.

usage_string = """Usage: 
    
python %(program)s [OPTIONS] <file.xml>

    OPTIONS may be:    
    
-a OR --algorithm
    The name of the lowercaisng algorithm used to convert majuscule to 
    minuscule characters. Supported algorithms are:
    * simple (default): lowercases everything, regardless of acronyms, proper 
    names, dates, etc.
    * complex: keeps the case of words that do not present a preferred form, 
    i.e. words that might occur uppercased even if they are not at the beginning 
    of a sentence. Some fuzzy thresholds are hardcoded and were fixed based on
    empirical observation of the Genia corpus.
    
-x OR --text
    Use as input a text file instead of XML file. One sentence per line, 
    tokenised with spaces. Output will be text as well.
    
-m OR --moses
    Uses Moses factored corpus format as input. This format must be pure text,
    one sentence per line, tokens separated by spaces, each token being:
    surface|lemma|POS|syntrelation:synthead
    Which are equivalent to the xml fields. Empty fields should be left blank,
    but every token must have 3 vertical bars. The actual character for vertical
    bars must be escabed and replaced by a placeholder that does not contain
    this character (e.g. %%VERTICAL_BAR%%)
    
-l OR --lemmas
	Lowercase lemmas instead of surface forms. Might be useful when dealing with
	corpora which were accidentally parsed before lowercasing, and the parser
	doesn't lowercase lemmas (as it is the case in RASP 2, for instance)

%(common_options)s

    IMPORTANT: you are supposed to perform lowercasing before any linguistic
    processing. Therefore, this algorithm operates on surface forms by default. 
    Except if you specify the -l option, lemmas will be ignored during 
    lowercasing.

    The <file.xml> file must be valid XML (dtd/mwetoolkit-*.dtd).

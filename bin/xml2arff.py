    This script converts a candidates file in XML (mwetoolkit-candidates.dtd)
    into a corresponding representation in the arff file format, used by the
    WEKA machine learning toolkit. Only features and TP base are considered,
    information about the candidate's ngrams or occurrences are ignored. Please
    notice that if you don't have a feature that uniquely identifies your 
    candidate, you will not be able to trace back the classifier results to the
    original candidates.

Project: sf.net/projects/mwetoolkit

The goal of the mwetoolkit is to perform automatic Multiword Expression 
extraction. Please read this documentation before you start the work.

    1) INSTALLING
    
(Please refer to the website for up-to-date installation documentation.)
    
To install the mwetoolkit, just download it from the SVN repository using the 
following command:

svn co https://mwetoolkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mwetoolkit mwetoolkit

The toolkit is also availaible as a stable release at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/mwetoolkit/files/latest/download

However, as the code evolves fast, we recommend you to use the SVN version 
instead.

Once you have downloaded (and unzipped, in the case of a release) the toolkit, 
navigate to the main folder and run the command

make

for compiling the C libraries used by the toolkit. If you do not run this 
command, the toolkit will still work but it will use a Python version (much 
slower and possibly obsolete!) of the indexing and counting scripts. This may be 
OK for small corpora.

    2) SCRIPTS and PROGRAMS

The "bin" folder contains a set of Python scripts that automatise part of the
MWE extraction process. Call each script with parameter -h and you will have
a complete list of arguments and options to use.

Alternatively, for simple MWE extraction tasks you can call bin/mweconsole.sh, 
which contains a friendlier command-line interface to the scripts.

Please refer to the website for tutorials, quick start and more documentation.

    3) DOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITIONS

You will find three different DTD files that describe the format of the three
inputs of the MWT toolkit scripts:

* mwttoolkit-corpus.dtd
* mwttoolkit-dict.dtd
* mwttoolkit-candidates.dtd
* mwetoolkit-patterns.dtd

You should add a link to the folder containing the DTD specifications to every
folder containing XML files used by the mwetoolkit (working-dir). Therefore, 
please use the following command:

cd working-dir
ln -s mwetoolkit-dir/dtd

    4) EXAMPLES

The "toy" folder contains a set of files for performing a toy experiment.
You can try to run the whole pipeline by calling "./testAll.sh" The specific
documentation about the examples is in a dedicated README file.

    5) REGRESSION TESTS

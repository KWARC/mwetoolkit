resumption of the session I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Friday @card@ December @card@ , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoy a pleasant festive period . </s>
although , as you will have see , the dreaded ' millennium bug ' fail to materialise , still the people in a number of country suffer a series of natural disaster that truly be dreadful . </s>
you have request a debate on this subject in the course of the next few day , during this part-session . </s>
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute 's silence , as a number of member have request , on behalf of all the victim concern , particularly those of the terrible storm , in the various country of the European Union . </s>
Please rise , then , for this minute 's silence . </s>
( the House rise and observe a minute 's silence ) Madam President , on a point of order . </s>
you will be aware from the press and television that there have be a number of bomb explosion and killing in Sri Lanka . </s>
One of the people assassinate very recently in Sri Lanka be Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who have visit the European Parliament just a few month ago . </s>
Would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President express Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent death in Sri Lanka and urge her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ? </s>
yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggest would be entirely appropriate . </s>
if the House agree , I shall do as Mr Evans have suggest . </s>
madam President , on a point of order . </s>
I would like your advice about Rule @card@ concern inadmissibility . </s>
my question relate to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again . </s>
the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programme come before Parliament on Thursday and contain a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalty should be introduce for country which fail to meet their fleet reduction target annually . </s>
it say that this should be do despite the principle of relative stability . </s>
I believe that the principle of relative stability be a fundamental legal principle of the common fishery policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible . </s>
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what be merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that be something I can competently do on Thursday . </s>
that be precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , I. E. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report . </s>
madam President , coincide with this year 's first part-session of the European Parliament , a date have be set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young @card@ year-old man who have be sentence to death . </s>
we shall call him Mr Hicks . </s>
at the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition have already be present , which many people sign , include myself . </s>
however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which be now constantly follow by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representation , use the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who have the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemn person . </s>
this be all in accordance with the principle that we have always uphold . </s>
thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly . </s>
indeed , it be quite in keep with the position this house have always adopt . </s>
madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament have consistently show an interest . </s>
it be the case of Alexander Nikitin . </s>
all of us here be please that the court have acquit him and make it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information be a constitutional right . </s>
now , however , he be to go before the court once more because the public prosecutor be appeal . </s>
we know , and we have state as much in very many resolution indeed , include specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year , that this be not solely a legal case and that it be wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accuse of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiary of his finding . </s>
these finding form the basis of the European programme to protect the Barents Sea , and that be why I would ask you to examine a draft letter set out the most important fact and to make Parliament 's position , as express in the resolution which it have adopt , clear as far as Russia be concern . </s>
yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be please to look into the fact of this case when I have receive your letter . </s>
madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have keep your word and that , during this first part-session of the new year , the number of television channel in our office have indeed increase considerably . </s>
but , Madam President , my personal request have not be meet . </s>
although there be now two Finnish channel and one Portuguese one , there be still no Dutch channel , which be what I have request because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we be send to this place of exile every month . </s>
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well . </s>
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter be on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday . </s>
it will , I hope , be examine in a positive light . </s>
madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament do not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually pass ? </s>
why have no air quality test be do on this particular building since we be elect ? </s>
why have there be no Health and Safety Committee meeting since @card@ ? </s>
why have there be no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament building or the Strasbourg Parliament building ? </s>
why be there no fire instruction ? </s>
why have the staircase not be improve since my accident ? </s>
why be no-smoke area not enforce ? </s>
it seem absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves . </s>
Mrs Lynne , you be quite right and I shall check whether this have actually not be do . </s>
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I be certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulation we ourselves vote on . </s>
madam President , Mrs Díez González and I have table question on certain opinion of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appear in a Spanish newspaper . </s>
the competent service have not include them in the agenda on the ground that they have be answer in a previous part-session . </s>
I would ask that they reconsider , since this be not the case . </s>
the question answer previously refer to Mrs de Palacio 's intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comment which appear in the ABC newspaper on @card@ November . </s>
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this . </s>
I admit that , at present , the matter seem to be somewhat confuse . </s>
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything be as it should be . </s>
madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message go out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refuse to renew the arm embargo on Indonesia , consider that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorse the arm embargo in Indonesia in the past ? </s>
today 's decision not to renew the embargo be extremely dangerous consider the situation there . </s>
so Parliament should send a message , since that be the wish of the vast majority . </s>
it be irresponsible of Eu Member States to refuse to renew the embargo . </s>
as people have say , the situation there be extremely volatile . </s>
There be , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future . </s>
we do not know what be happen . </s>
so why should Eu arm producer profit at the expense of innocent people ? </s>
in any event , this question be not presently include among the request for topical and urgent debate on Thursday . </s>
agenda the next item be the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as draw up by the conference of president at its meeting of @card@ January pursuant to Rule @card@ of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
no amendment have be propose relate to Monday and Tuesday . </s>
relate to Wednesday : the Group of the Party of European Socialists request that a Commission statement be include on its strategic objective for the next five year and on the administrative reform of the Commission . </s>
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who make the request , to speak to propose it . </s>
that be , if he so wish , of course . </s>
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hear one speaker in favour and one against . </s>
madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission 's political programme for the whole legislature be initially a proposal by the Group of the party of European socialist which be unanimously approve by the Conference of Presidents in September and which be also explicitly accept by President Prodi , who reiterate his commitment in his inaugural speech . </s>
this commitment be important because the Commission be a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaty and , therefore , basically dictate this Parliament 's political and legislative activity for the next five year . </s>
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament vote to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature . </s>
it do so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it vote once more to approve the whole Commission . </s>
There have therefore be enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizen . </s>
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of @card@ September , which recommend that the proposal be present as soon as possible . </s>
the event of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents , that conference be use simply to corroborate and ratify decision take elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . </s>
either the Commission be not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it . </s>
accord to its President , it be in a position to do so . </s>
give that the Commission be represent by Vice-President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it be to present this programme , as agree . </s>
alternatively , Parliament be not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggest . </s>
in my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament , as well as introduce an original thesis , an unknown method which consist of make political group aware , in writing , of a speech concern the Commission 's programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier , as have be agree - bear in mind that the legislative programme will be discuss in February , so we could forego the debate , since on the next day our citizen will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it . </s>
My Group believe that since a parliament be mean to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission be ready to do so , we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfil our duty to our fellow citizen . </s>
therefore , the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , and which you have mention , be that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday , include its propose administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there be no text , on the one hand , the President of the Commission would be deny his right to speak in this Parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament have no prior knowledge of the text on which it be base . </s>
therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote . </s>
( applause from the PSE Group ) Madam President , I really be quite astonish at Mr Barón Crespo 's behaviour and the fact that he be now ask for this item to be put on Wednesday 's agenda . </s>
Mr Barón Crespo , you be unable to attend the conference of president last Thursday . </s>
I be not criticise this ; it happen from time to time that people send someone to represent them . </s>
Mr Hänsch represent you on this occasion . </s>
in the conference of president , we have an in-depth discussion . </s>
your Group be alone in advocate what you be say now . </s>
we then put it to a vote . </s>
as you know , each chairman have the same number of vote as his Group have member . </s>
There be a vote on this matter . </s>
as I recall , the outcome of this vote be @card@ vote to @card@ with a few abstention . </s>
this mean that all the group with the exception of the non-attached member - but , of course , they be not a Group - be in agreement ; only your Group think that we should proceed as you have propose here . </s>
all of the other be of a different opinion . </s>
that be the decision . </s>
I should now like to comment on the issue itself . </s>
we have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone know , the vast majority of our Group support the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission . </s>
we believe , however , that the Commission 's strategic plan need to be debate within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which be adopt in the Commission and which describe this programme over the five-year period . </s>
There be no such document ! </s>
the Commission will present its programme for the year @card@ in February . </s>
we have say , very well , if the Commission do not wish to introduce the @card@ programme as early as January then we will do it in February . </s>
we have agree to this . </s>
after all , we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path . </s>
however , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which come out of the Commission . </s>
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our group . </s>
you can prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content . </s>
that be why we would recommend - and it be my impression that the Commission be also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission 's long-term programme up to the year @card@ in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that , at the same time , in February we also hold the debate on the Commission 's legislative programme for the year @card@ . </s>
the fact that the subject be connect also suggest that we should hold the debate on both programme together . </s>
that be why my Group firmly reject the proposal make by the Socialist Group . </s>
( applause from the PPE-DE Group ) Madam President , I would like to make it very clear that , above all , the Commission have absolute respect for the decision of this Parliament and , amongst those , the decision establish its agenda . </s>
we therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide . </s>
but I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi make a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate , as Mr Barón Crespo have remind us , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission 's legislative programme , on the broad area of action for the next five year , that be to say , for this legislature . </s>
madam President , I would like to say that the agreement reach in September distinguish this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission 's legislative programme . </s>
I would also like to say that the Commission be prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it be convenient and that we be ready to do so this week as we have agree originally , on the basis that it would be present the day before in a speech to parliamentary group . </s>
therefore , Madam President , I would like to repeat that the Commission have debate the action plan for the next five year and , when Parliament decide , - this week if that be the decision - we be prepare to come and explain the programme for the next five year and , next month , the programme for @card@ , which be what we fully agree upon . </s>
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the party of European socialist that the Commission statement on its strategic objective should be reinstate . </s>
( Parliament reject the request ) President . </s>
still on the subject of Wednesday 's sit , I have another proposal regard the oral question on capital tax . </s>
the PPE-DE Group be request that this item be take off the agenda . </s>
be there a member who wish to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ? </s>
madam President , I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists . </s>
I be tell that large section of the Socialist Group be also keen to have this item take off the agenda , because at the vote in the conference of president no vote be receive from the work group of member of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter . </s>
I do not know whether this information be correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item be remove because Parliament have address this issue several time already . </s>
decision have also be adopt against a tax of this kind . </s>
that be why my Group move that this item be take off the agenda . </s>
thank you , Mr Poettering . </s>
we shall now hear Mr Wurtz speak against this request . </s>
madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering 's lack of logic . </s>
he have just be preach to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they go back on a decision take in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of president , and now he be do just the same . </s>
we discuss that matter and we be unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR group . </s>
as my fellow chairman will recall , I even mention that it be not a matter of know whether one be for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think of it . </s>
it be not a lot to ask . </s>
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retain so that we can find out , once and for all , the position of these two body regard the proposal which be relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generate by the failure of the Seattle Conference . </s>
we shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group 's request that the oral question regard the capital tax be withdraw from the agenda . </s>
( Parliament reject the request , with @card@ vote for , @card@ vote against and 7 abstention ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertise this debate . </s>
thank you very much . </s>
madam President , have my vote be count ? </s>
I be unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card . </s>
my vote be &quot; in favour &quot; . </s>
indeed , if we add the two member who have declare themselves , then the result of the vote would be ... . </s>
madam President , the Presidency have already declare the result of the vote . </s>
There be no room for amendment . </s>
lady and gentleman , once again , we see it be essential for member to bring their voting card along on a Monday . </s>
clearly there be a problem here . </s>
that be the case , I shall have to make a decision . </s>
I too forget my card , and I would have vote against . </s>
I therefore consider that the oral question may be keep on the agenda as per the vote . </s>
this be the last time that we shall make allowance for member who have forget their card . </s>
let that be clearly note and understand . </s>
( applause ) the oral question will therefore remain on the agenda , and yes , your president be entitle to vote just as she be entitle to forget her voting card . </s>
we shall continue with the other amendment to the agenda . </s>
madam President , in the early vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicate that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group . </s>
that do not happen . </s>
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allow to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group . </s>
this be an important matter . </s>
it would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just do in the light of their own political analysis . </s>
madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I have also ask for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion . </s>
you do not call me either . </s>
I regret this , but the vote have already be take and the decision be make so let us leave the matter there . </s>
I be terribly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox . </s>
I do not see you ask to speak . </s>
even so , I think the position be quite clear and they shall be enter in the Minutes . </s>
when we adopt the Minutes for today 's sit tomorrow , then any member who think the position have not be explain clearly enough may ask for amendment . </s>
this seem to me to be a workable solution . </s>
of course , the Minutes for tomorrow be sit will take into account any additional explanation . </s>
I think this be a good solution than proceed now to extremely time-consuming explanation of vote . </s>
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ? </s>
madam President , if the vote record correctly how my Group vote I shall not , and can , object to that . </s>
if your ruling be that I can give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservation . </s>
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course . </s>
if they do not properly reflect the position adopt , then we may correct them , if necessary . </s>
( the order of business be adopt thus amend ) safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good the next item be the report ( A5-0105 / @card@ ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopt by the Council with a view to adopt a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirement for safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway ( C5-0208 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) . </s>
Commissioner , Madam President , lady and gentleman , I can be quite frank in say that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmonise the training of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway . </s>
firstly , we need to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirement of Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC , which oblige the Member States to appoint safety adviser and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but do not explain this explicitly . </s>
secondly , by adopt this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous good be both transport and transship ; b ) a reduction in distortion of competition result from wide variation in national training structure and training cost and c ) equal opportunity for safety adviser on the European labour market . </s>
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stand in the common position , guarantee - in particular because it confine itself exclusively to minimum standard - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopt it we contribute to the Member States ' bear a high level of individual responsibility . </s>
all of this be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and be therefore to be greatly welcome . </s>
our amendment from the first reading have , I believe , be take into account very satisfactorily . </s>
they have either be accept or transpose with no change in the substance , or they have be reject because the corresponding European arrangement have not be include , for example a system of penalty for violation of the rule or a complex classification structure for related group of question . </s>
the one unanimously adopt amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concern the timetable for implement the directive , be something which I would urge you to support . </s>
by not set a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead give them a period of three month after its entry into force , we be introduce a flexibility clause which ensure that the directive will be implement without delay . </s>
I would urge you to endorse this . </s>
madam President , we can and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accident cause major damage on our road , but also on our railway and waterway , not solely but at least partly because those involve do not take the transport of dangerous good seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the driver or other responsible for the various vehicle - a minor accident have all too often become a major disaster . </s>
as an Austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human life last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the part of the tunnel which have be destroy in this fire continue for many month at huge expense . </s>
the renovation project , which last for month , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe . </s>
the traffic which have to be divert because of this stretch the patience of many thousand of people in the Eu to the limit . </s>
in fact , all hell break loose in some municipality in my province . </s>
prevention have to be our answer to disaster of this kind and this draft directive be an important step towards well-trained safety adviser be available , so that the right action be take in good time . </s>
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enact European law to ensure great safety . </s>
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rule be transpose by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they be also apply afterwards . </s>
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement . </s>
I should like to address one final point . </s>
we must not content ourselves with seal another hole in the safety net and shut our eye to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe be concern , there be still much more to be do . </s>
in this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who be with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continue to make it safe for traffic to transit tunnel in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disaster on this scale . </s>
madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which have , at its heart , the issue of transport safety . </s>
the report look at the issue of harmonise the examination requirement for safety advisor work in the area of transportation of dangerous good by road , rail and inland waterway . </s>
I congratulate him on his excellent report . </s>
transport safety have sadly be in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crash involve Eu citizen and the natural disaster involve the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four month - remind us that transport safety can never be take for grant and that those charge with protect the public must be highly motivate and highly qualify . </s>
the rapporteur have point out to the house that in its common position the Council have accept six of Parliament 's ten amendment put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendment have be retain . </s>
My Group will therefore support the common position and look forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European union as safe as possible . </s>
when it come to safety my Group will always support any initiative to improve transport safety . </s>
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent event have prove . </s>
madam President , I would like to make a few comment . </s>
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it have submit . </s>
we be concern here with the harmonisation of examination requirement but also , in fact , with minimum requirement . </s>
this be a pity , in a sense . </s>
needless to say , safety on road , railway and inland waterway be of key importance and , give the international nature of these type of transport , training for safety advisor should also be harmonise , therefore , as well as the requirement of the new ADR , for example , which be under way . </s>
this be important , but so be enforcement and there be , of course , a number of reason why we need to pay particular attention to this . </s>
just think of the road accident which have occur over recent year , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other country where lorry carry dangerous good continue to drive in foggy condition when really they should have pull off the road instead . </s>
or ship from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ship over here , with all the obvious risk that this entail . </s>
furthermore , it have transpire that research in the port in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan have show that @card@ % of container with partially dangerous cargo be not deliver correctly for shipment . </s>
in short , the issue be an important one . </s>
if we look at the situation where safety adviser be concern , in a number of country it be compulsory to employ such safety adviser in company as from 1 January of this year . </s>
There will be major problem with enforce this rule at present , especially with small company , as these can afford safety advisor . </s>
these small company either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which cause problem . </s>
it be therefore also be request that ISO @card@ certificate possibly include the fine detail of these activity in the form of annual report and company analysis . </s>
the work be do . </s>
all that remain be the business of enforcement . </s>
I would like to mention one final point . </s>
with regard to enforcement , proper agreement must also be conclude with the eastern European country because they will not enter into treaty which deal with this matter until 1 July @card@ , that be to say in eighteen month ' time . </s>
this give them a competitive edge for the interim period . </s>
this be not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspect for good transport by road , rail and inland waterway and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the accede state . </s>
madam President , the importance of transport safety be highlight on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so . </s>
the ever increase volume of good pass through Europe entail all kind of risk , know and unknown , for employee and the social environment . </s>
those have to deal with these risk should therefore meet stringent requirement . </s>
the relevant standard which have be lay down in another Directive , @card@ / @card@ / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous good . </s>
I be very please that agreement have also be reach with the council on minimum standard regard examination , although I would have prefer it if uniform , set standard and module have be establish , so that certificate would be of equal value internationally . </s>
this , however , do not seem feasible . </s>
finally , the amendment table by the rapporteur be perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his report which , though technical , be nonetheless of very great significance for safety . </s>
I should like to make just a few comment . </s>
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I be convince that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention be pay to the issue of safety , be it on the road , on the waterway or at sea . </s>
consider that it be only today that we be deal with a Commission proposal first make on @card@ March @card@ , even though Parliament respond relatively quickly , this time lag be a little too long . </s>
this be not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well . </s>
my second point have already be mention : it concern the minimum standard . </s>
in principle , I believe that in many case where transport be concern we should be work towards increase flexibility and country-specific rule . </s>
however , when it come to safety , I be rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , be in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria . </s>
I can live with these minimum standard , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully . </s>
Should flexibility of this kind result in there be inadequate rule in some country then we should work towards great harmonisation . </s>
my third point have also be mention already . </s>
as you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue play a particularly important role . </s>
we do not want to make the condition of competition bad for some country unilaterally and improve them for country such as Austria or other transit country . </s>
but I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous good to a minimum , in all country , whether they be transit country or not . </s>
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improve the text and present this report and this proposal ; in the end there be only one amendment on the requirement for the aptitude examination for safety adviser in the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway . </s>
we understand that it be important that the two institution - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , be magnificent . </s>
the common position include practically all of the amendment accept by the Commission and harmonise the minimum examination requirement for safety adviser and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the propose date , which be much more realistic than the one originally suggest by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spend several year debate this question . </s>
very briefly , I would like to thank the various member for their intervention and to tell you that safety be one of the Commission 's priority in the field of transport . </s>
as Mr Simpson have say very correctly , this be a process which we can never take for grant or regard as have come to an end . </s>
the process of increase safety margin and safety guarantee in transport be a process which must be improve day by day . </s>
in this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problem of the tunnel , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have refer to , which , in the case of Austria , be doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be make to improve their safety . </s>
in one of the bad accident to have occur recently , the good be transport be not dangerous in themselves . </s>
margarine and a few kilo of paint which , in principle , do not present risk , lead to a genuine disaster . </s>
therefore , we will have to see how the requirement guarantee the maximum degree of safety can be further improve . </s>
finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all type of transport . </s>
this week we will be hold a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objective in term of the safety of air transport . </s>
but I would like to say that safety be a priority objective for the Commission . </s>
as I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there be a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there be no such circumstance , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem . </s>
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speaker and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. transport of dangerous good by road the next item be the report ( A5-0104 / @card@ ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC on the approximation of the law of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous good by road [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0004 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ] . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the directive on the approximation of the law of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous good by road , which enter into force on 1 January @card@ , contain a number of transitional provision which be only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity be link to the completion of specific standardisation work by the Cen , that be the European Committee for Standardisation . </s>
delay in the Cen 's work be now make it difficult to apply this very directive . </s>
in particular , annexe can be adapt to take account of technical and industrial development . </s>
I regret this since we be have to take action because other have not do their job . </s>
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC which have be table for discussion today . </s>
Should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be oblige to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the Cen complete its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty . </s>
the amendment to the directive on today 's agenda do not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous good in the Community . </s>
it merely prolong transitional rule by postpone deadline , delete provision which be no longer applicable , and lay down the procedure for a ) carry out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous good and b ) enact less stringent national regulation , in particular for the transport of very small amount of dangerous good within strictly define local area . </s>
the amendment to the directive be consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more power . </s>
the Commission decide whether the Member States may impose certain rule of their own . </s>
in so do , it be support by a committee of expert on the transport of dangerous good under the regulatory procedure . </s>
the procedure for the exercise of these implement power confer on the Commission be lay down afresh in the Council Decision of June @card@ . </s>
the proposal to be discuss today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road , date from May @card@ , however , and could not therefore take account of the late comitology procedure . </s>
Two of the amendment table and adopt unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amend comitology procedure . </s>
we would like to ensure that there be a reference to this as early as the recital and that the period within which the Council have to make a decision - which be not clearly word - be set at a maximum of three month . </s>
in addition , the need for great transparency have be point out . </s>
a further amendment allow the Member States to impose more stringent requirement , in particular for vacuum tank , if work be do or good be transport as a priority in temperature well below -20ºC . </s>
this be in the special interest of northern European region . </s>
a final amendment be intend to ensure that tank and tanker put into service between 1 January @card@ and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be use provide that they have be construct and maintain in accordance with it . </s>
I do realise that this be only a small step towards increase transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report . </s>
Mr President , colleague , a happy new year and millennium to you all . </s>
I be speak for the first time in this plenary part-session , so this be quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that do last long than two minute . </s>
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission 's proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road . </s>
it be good that this directive should be establish now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national act for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary cost and which would once more increase concern with regard to Eu bureaucracy . </s>
the Commission 's proposal , however , do not take account of all the fact , such as the cold climate that prevail in the northern region . </s>
consequently , I have table some amendment to Mr Koch 's intrinsically excellent report , which have be adopt by our committee . </s>
my amendment concern the frost-resistance rating for tanker carry these dangerous good . </s>
accord to the Commission 's proposal -20ºC would have be sufficient . </s>
on the shore of the Mediterranean , it be hard to imagine that in Lapland temperature can fall considerably low than that . </s>
There be support for the Eu in Lapland also , so let us remember them . </s>
I have thus propose that the frost rating be lower to -40ºC . </s>
this would be necessary to keep safety standard at the level they be in northern region previously . </s>
I hope my proposal will be take into consideration in tomorrow 's vote . </s>
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by express my admiration for the way in which you execute the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate . </s>
I think that it be quite superb . </s>
on the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the good - however dangerous they be - which be transport on Europe 's road , railway , and so on be as safe as possible . </s>
this directive be a contribution to this . </s>
What we be do today be essentially a nuisance . </s>
the rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thank for the work which he have do on this , have already point out that basically everything could have be somewhat more advanced have it not be for the inactivity on the part of the Cen , which have be very dilatory in draw up and adapt the directive . </s>
that be why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in @card@ , we will finally have Community regulation for the transport of dangerous good by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our road be a good deal safe . </s>
Commissioner , Mr President , I would first like to thank Mr Koch for his excellent report , which I do not have a great deal to add to . </s>
I would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous good continue to cause major problem , not just in India , where I have just come from , but also within the Eu . </s>
we only have to think of the serious accident in the Mont Blanc Tunnel about a year ago , not to mention the one in the Tauern Tunnel . </s>
we observe that there be always a possibility of major problem of this kind occur where nature give rise to troublesome phenomenon such as mist , storm or cold weather , particularly in the narrow Alpine pass . </s>
in general , I would urge that the transport of dangerous good be transfer more to rail . </s>
in this context , when plan future railway track or motorway , a preventative approach should be take and the appropriate long-term solution build into the process early on . </s>
I would remind you of the Brenner base tunnel , which have not be touch on even indirectly . </s>
while I be on the subject , I would also like to point out that transport problem be one of the key issue face the Eu and call on the Commission to give due attention to this . </s>
we need to have much more probe and vigorous debate on cutting-down on transport , heavy rail traffic , road pricing and railway privatisation , with a view to improve functionality . </s>
consider that enlargement towards the East will create a few more problem , then it become clear to us all that the future credibility of the Eu will depend on whether , and in what manner , we succeed in sort out the transport situation . </s>
Mr President , the report we be discuss here do not , in itself , entail any major change . </s>
most of the propose amendment be of a purely technical nature . </s>
it be nonetheless worth emphasise that , each time we make this type of decision , it be good from a broad environmental perspective and it be beneficial because it create good prior condition for exploit the possibility of the internal market . </s>
very large quantity of dangerous good be transport around the Eu , both on road and railway and by sea . </s>
this make it necessary to have proper rule govern transport of this kind . </s>
in area after area , we be now obtain common minimum regulation for the Member States . </s>
this be extraordinarily positive , and there be cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he have put in on this issue . </s>
this be also important where the prerequisite for the internal market be concern . </s>
if we be to get a common transport market genuinely up and run , it be important that we should not only have regulation but that these regulation should also , as far as possible , apply to every country . </s>
I should like to conclude by comment on a third matter which be also of significance , namely an amendment table by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen . </s>
in many way , the prerequisite differ from one Member State to another . </s>
by approve this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern part of the European Union . </s>
this make it necessary to also take account of the way in which material and packaging be affect by cold of this kind . </s>
it be good that , in establish the present regulation , we can also be flexible . </s>
I hope that the Commission be able to accept the present amendment . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the vice-president of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declare their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledge it as a priority . </s>
the reason Mr Koch produce his sound report be because the work in the Cen and within the United Nations Economic Commission be proceed none too expeditiously . </s>
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she be in a position to tell us today what the state of play be with regard to the effort towards harmonisation be make by these two organisation , and whether the Eu be in a position to hasten these harmonisation effort , in accordance with principle that be as simple as possible . </s>
for one thing be clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic do not stop at our border , it go beyond them . </s>
hence there be certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provision . </s>
if the Commissioner be unable to do so today then would she be prepare to inform the committee in write of how matter stand and what stage negotiation between the Cen and the Economic Commission be at ? </s>
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplement the debate which we hold in October on rail transport . </s>
we all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation ( Cen ) have not be able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provision necessary for the require harmonisation within the European Union . </s>
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiate element which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours . </s>
a moment ago , Mr Vatanen speak to us of low temperature , not of @card@ degree below zero , but of @card@ degree below zero . </s>
of course , we accept that amendment - it be absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstance which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specific and of concrete requirement for the establishment of standard and characterisation of a technical nature . </s>
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda 's comment on the activity of the Cen , that we be urge them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we be to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulty because their work have not be conclude . </s>
lastly , Mr President , the basic problem justify this amendment of the directive have be point out . </s>
we have refer to the delay by the Cen , the amendment of certain provision , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexe and the need to for it to be more specific . </s>
the Commission accept all of the contribution of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which be contain in the various amendment , specifically four . </s>
we therefore accept the four amendment which have be propose . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. structural fund - Cohesion Fund coordination the next item be the report ( A5-0108 / @card@ ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guideline for programme in the period @card@ [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0122 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , ah , now I see Commissioner Fischler be here , and there I be think that you would not be come . </s>
Welcome to Parliament ! </s>
lady and gentleman , we can overlook the fact that the benefit of the European internal market be reap most of all by the wealthy region , and even there they be not enjoy by all section of the population . </s>
How long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for , result as it do in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy region ? </s>
whilst , in the fifth report on the situation in the region , unemployment be seven time high in the poor region than in the wealthy region , the sixth report be already talk in term of it be eight time higher , despite the fact that European structural fund be pour into the region . </s>
hence , it will , of course , come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural fund regulation place great emphasis on the call for the fund to be implement more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the European objective of high employment level and sustainable development , to name but a few . </s>
Parliament , but above all the Member States , demand massive improvement . </s>
this be very soon forget , however , when the Commission develop the new instrument for the purpose , the guideline , and want to make the requirement for there to be efficiency , concentration , and simplification of administration in the implementation of the European structural fund more binding . </s>
subsequently , the Member State government refer to the principle of subsidiarity and just want to get their hand on the money . </s>
and so all that remain of the @card@ Berlin Summit be the indicative nature of the guideline . </s>
however , this at least place the Commission under the obligation to approve only those programme that will actually enable European objective to be achieve . </s>
I may have my doubt as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieve efficiency and increase concentration and in actually put the European objective into practice , but it be a fact that the guideline will be of central importance to the negotiation for the Community development programme . </s>
if you want our work at European level to be take seriously , then you must also take it seriously yourselves ! </s>
Parliament be not in a position to go into the content of the guideline because it be not consult until the legislative period be long since past . </s>
now that the programming phase be so far on , there be little point in start from scratch again . </s>
that be why in my report I concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument , with the blessing of the committee . </s>
firstly , the report assess the impact of the instrument per se . </s>
secondly , it uncover the shortcoming in the Commission document . </s>
for example , the question of partnership be simply leave out of the central part of the structural fund . </s>
One search the document in vain for the central principle , which call upon the Member States to see that programme be implement at local level in conjunction not only with the local authority and region but also with local actor , business and social organisation , NGOs , union , employer ' association , woman 's organisation , citizen ' initiative and employment initiative . </s>
the question as to why it be leave out have not be answer to date . </s>
Parliament make demand here that be of central importance . </s>
it expect the Commission to only approve those programme establish on the basis of partnership of this kind . </s>
it surprise me , member of the Conservative Group , to suddenly find that amendment aim at drop the decentralise approach have be produce overnight . </s>
all I can say be try take this to your region and explain to your electorate why the European principle of decentralisation be not to be put into practice in the region . </s>
let me tell you , you will not escape from that one unscathed ! </s>
we can have a situation where we agree principle in this House and , when it come to implement them , everyone do their own thing again . </s>
incidentally , I would just like to address a comment to the government of my country , where there be a desire simply to ignore the horizontal Community policy concern environmental protection and where it be maintain that there be no need to implement the FFH guideline . </s>
I believe it be a good thing that the Commission be hold firm here . </s>
this bring me to my final point . </s>
the guideline must serve as the hard and fast criterion we use to assess whether Article 1 of the regulation be actually be implement . </s>
I expect the Commission to ensure that the guideline , which certainly allow for adequate flexibility , be in every sense the benchmark for the negotiation . </s>
we represent the European position . </s>
in other word , sustainability in transport policy must be take into account every bit as much as the entitlement of woman to a share of financial support , as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution , thus enable there to be sustainable urban development and truly model project in rural area . </s>
this be what I expect the outcome of the Community development programme to be , and I do not expect you to give way on this again . </s>
How else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate ? </s>
not by continue to wait and try to cheat our way through again . </s>
we can wait . </s>
in a few year time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implement European structural policy because a great many more country will be join us and then we will have no choice but to create much improve , more efficient and more concentrated structure . </s>
and that will only be the beginning . </s>
I therefore expect the Commission to take Parliament 's demand seriously in the course of the negotiation and to actually put the European position into practice here , give a progressive regional policy a chance at long last . </s>
Mr President , it be particularly please for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what be regard as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales . </s>
a major part of Wales , as you know , have be grant Objective 1 status under the structural fund programme . </s>
it be quite clear that many people within Wales be look to the European structural fund programme to alleviate some of the great difficulty that we undoubtedly face . </s>
we have see poverty grow in Wales ; and grow still further since @card@ . </s>
we have see the gap between rich and poor widen . </s>
we be look , therefore , within the structural fund programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wide improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality . </s>
What be , however , deeply damage for us be the belief that in some way the grant of structural fund assistance be something that have be , in a sense , a success of the government . </s>
it be sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulty that Wales face . </s>
that be why I want to highlight some of the issue that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront . </s>
we look to the Commission to deal with point in relation to additionality . </s>
we be dissatisfy with the fact that those figure seem to have be in some way hide within UK figure . </s>
we look to the Commission also to ensure that there be match funding for project . </s>
we look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be provide the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , be involve in the planning stage . </s>
finally , we ask that the Commission ensure that Structural Fund monies be spend in a way which be transparent . </s>
too much of what take place within this Parliament be not transparent . </s>
this be one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales . </s>
Mr President , our committee view these issue very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research . </s>
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusion , the rapporteur have take account of our committee 's proposal that the Cohesion Fund country should broaden the research infrastructure by locate university and college in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped region well than now and make it easy for educate people to remain in their home district . </s>
this will be possible with action on the part of government , and such decentralisation of high education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development . </s>
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , be that we would have like the Commission to pay more attention to the effect of service , electronic commerce and the grow use of the Internet , when they be plan the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds . </s>
poverty and wealth use to depend more on mean of livelihood . </s>
the rich area be those where there be job in industry , but today those area might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , mean we also have to invest in new sector of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of service , because they be the industry of the future . </s>
in my opinion the committee draft the report have not take sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission 's attention to this issue . </s>
finally , as the committee represent energy , we would have like the issue of support for renewable energy resource from Cohesion and Regional Development fund to have be emphasise still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increase the use of renewables so that the scant funding resource in the energy programme might have be compensate by mean of these more substantial sum . </s>
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she have do on this and to explain to colleague that I be speak for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who follow this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who be unfortunately ill . </s>
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which be agree by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accept by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . </s>
these amendment deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local scheme to develop employment opportunity and strengthen social cohesion . </s>
in the past , this Parliament have view the social economy as an important potential provider of employment . </s>
these amendment also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion be a serious issue need constructive action . </s>
we hope that those consider rejection of these amendment have very powerful reason to offer to both Parliament and their citizen who be seek employment . </s>
in her report , Mrs Flautre also draw attention to an area where coordination be sorely lack , yet desperately need . </s>
the Commission proposal refer to the four pillar of employment strategy and the five field of action of the European Social Fund . </s>
but the lack of specific guideline here be particularly to be regret , as the idea of link Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the @card@ programme . </s>
it could be say that the omission give the impression that the Commission too have no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which be subject to review after three and a half year , and the Member States ' annual national plan for employment . </s>
we hope that the Commission can reassure us that this be an oversight which be now be deal with constructively . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal present by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , be a reasonable start point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . </s>
I would like to point out , however , that this start point indicate to us the challenge which face us : maintain a population in rural area , give the change take place in all type of economic activity owe to agriculture 's increase lack of importance amongst the various source of income for rural society . </s>
this , as well as the deficiency in the network of infrastructure and service and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore be seasonal and lack diversity , exacerbate the exodus from rural area . </s>
the consequence do not inspire hope . </s>
it be the young people who be disappear , who be get an education and find work outside of the rural area , all of which have an unfavourable effect on those area . </s>
this lack of infrastructure be also an obstacle to the establishment of company and the creation of job . </s>
we have to remember that rural area represent almost four fifth of the territory of the European Union . </s>
Agriculture only provide @card@ % of employment in the Union . </s>
furthermore , three quarter of our farm worker be part-time and require supplement to their income . </s>
for this reason , one of the most important and essential objective which we should set in the European Union be to make effort to create new job in rural area , outside of the agricultural sector , in sector such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of business , new technology , service , etc . </s>
however , even though the role of agriculture be not exclusive , it be still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost town , but also because farmer play a fundamental role in manage the land , in preserve biodiversity and in protect the environment . </s>
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which be consistent with the objective we have set . </s>
we want rural area , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi-functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to open up to the diversity of non-agricultural activity . </s>
it be important to prioritise general criterion for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issue , which have be only partly take up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its point @card@ and @card@ . </s>
in conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five point into account when establish the conclusion on the four pillar because I believe that , for the European Union , maintain the population in rural area must be one of the priority objective . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thank Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work . </s>
I think that this work have be carry out extremely well . </s>
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political group when compromise formula have need to be reach in the face of this avalanche of amendment - and perhaps there be more of them than we expect - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we be now discuss . </s>
we feel that it be important that the Commission take account of the conclusion adopt by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we be do here be a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air . </s>
the truth of the matter though be that we believe - and this be also show in the way the conclusion have be draft - that the Commission must take account of what be adopt by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directive . </s>
in our amendment , we have state the importance of the necessary synergy be produce between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiative , so that their application should be reflect , in the good and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparity between region and by the creation of job which be , when all be say and do , the two central purpose of the fund we be discuss . </s>
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attain these objective , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneur and those who really guarantee new source of employment , that be , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative . </s>
small and medium-sized business , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these fund . </s>
if they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneur can take part , not only in manage but also in receive these fund , we will have miss an opportunity to attain our objective more rapidly . </s>
also , in order to attain our objective , to overcome the disparity between region and to seek out source of employment , it be crucial to give our complete support to new technology , to transport and communication network and to renewable energy . </s>
all of this must be do - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by unite its effort with those of public administration , but complement them , never obstruct or exclude them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of job . </s>
Mr President , it be incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieve Objective 1 status . </s>
it be because of the discredited policy of his own Conservative Party . </s>
let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , be Secretary of State for Wales , he break every rule in the book on additionality which lead to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regard regulatory requirement . </s>
I can tell you that the British government be aware of its regulatory requirement on Objective 1 additionality . </s>
I suggest Mr Evans go back and read the regulation . </s>
My Group have make extensive amendment to both report up for debate today . </s>
I want to focus our mind on the essential role of the guideline . </s>
the objective be to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resource in the wide partnership and to put these region back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine . </s>
it be important to identify the skill and potential of our region in the hi-tech sector . </s>
it be particularly important in the light of report in the medium that Europe be rapidly lose ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industry of the future . </s>
the operation of the previous round of programme be also very instructive in tell us what guideline should not be about . </s>
they should not be about create additional layer of bureaucracy and red tape . </s>
they should not be about shift priority and policy halfway through project development , result in inevitable delay and underspends , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement . </s>
the implementation and operation of the guideline can be leave to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service . </s>
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respect the specific local and regional aspect of Commission programme . </s>
the conclusion be that we must make the case for guideline to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme manager and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new field of regeneration . </s>
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak region we will eventually get them back onto the road of attract substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success . </s>
this be how we be go to judge the success of these guideline : whether Eu regional policy with a good , solid , enable guideline , can open up new opportunity and allow our poor and structurally weak region to play their full part in contribute to the growth and prosperity of the Eu . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report . </s>
she have go into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she take account of many of the amendment that have be table regard this report . </s>
the rapporteur have also quite rightly state that Parliament be not hear in time regard the guideline . </s>
we be badly behind now in this matter . </s>
hopefully , the stand Parliament have take will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programme and in their practical implementation . </s>
for the time , the report grow too large when it be be debate . </s>
it contain detail and issue that have already be raise in previous report . </s>
at this stage it be more important to concentrate on assess how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bear in mind that the aim be to reduce regional inequality . </s>
our Group emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local player in draft and implement programme . </s>
it be especially important to get SMEs involve in the planning and implementation of programme . </s>
our Group also consider it important to take great account of remote and peripheral area and wish to increase interaction between town and rural area . </s>
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercise and we be call for a reduction in the bureaucracy that have take root in the draft and implementation of programme . </s>
project implement with support from the Union have have their effect water down all too often by slow decision make and complicated administrative process . </s>
fund have often be grant for project which have have no lasting benefit for the area concern . </s>
project have to be carry out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be make more productive . </s>
while the report be be prepare , it be interesting to discuss the Union 's regional policy in general . </s>
for us new member , it be the first time , and this be a very interesting process . </s>
this report be very good and our Group support it . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament have not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , have not be able to reach plenary sit because the plan for regional development for the period @card@ for Objective 1 region have be sit in the Commission 's office for several month . </s>
bear this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support framework for the period in question be approve , they be study and submit for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guideline that we have present today . </s>
this be because we think that they be particularly able to create employment in the poor and least-developed region and we would thus contribute to reverse the harmful trend towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fair Europe . </s>
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination be to achieve economic and social cohesion . </s>
we be oblige to participate in draft directive and also in assess their result . </s>
we be oblige to do so because we be the representative of the citizen in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of region . </s>
we feel that the fund be a necessary but insufficient condition for achieve economic and social cohesion . </s>
we might be mistake in use the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator . </s>
some speaker have already mention unemployment and the fall in population . </s>
we will have to study several indicator , which will enable us to see the current state of regional society that be in a bad situation than other , and how they be evolve . </s>
it be clear from some of the report that have be present to Parliament 's plenary sit today that Europe 's @card@ most prosperous region enjoy a level of unemployment which be five time low than in the @card@ least prosperous region . </s>
this fact mean that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically . </s>
I agree that the European Parliament do not have the opportunity - or that it be not give the opportunity , as we have reach the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directive . </s>
I do not think , however , that this report have come too late . </s>
we need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programme and the plan for regional development , which have be draft before the directive come into force , can be submit for revision and proper assessment . </s>
we all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programme , when the assessment of the directive be make , Parliament should be give an equally influential role on the ground that we be the citizen ' representative . </s>
our citizen can accept that the European Union take decision in a way that be , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic . </s>
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that official accept their responsibility and that there be communication with the citizen . </s>
this be what we be today ask the Commissioner for . </s>
I would like to think that , give his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicator , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity . </s>
Mr President , I support the main proposal of the report concern the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period @card@ and the main recommendation of the report which include the follow : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of Eu Structural and Cohesion Funds . </s>
this mean that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authority and national government with regard to how these fund be to be spend . </s>
member state be urge to attach great importance to integrated strategy for revitalise relation between town and rural area . </s>
this latter point be of particular importance . </s>
while urban renewal in our city be very important we must always strike a balance in our policy between promote rural development and improve the life of city dweller . </s>
we do not want to build a Europe of city alone . </s>
the structural fund have play a key role in the development both of urban and rural part of peripheral country , mainly through the upgrading of road , water treatment and related transport network . </s>
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guideline lay down by the Eu leader at their Berlin Summit last year , which be support by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session . </s>
Key Eu programme between @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ have certainly help to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral country and objective 1 region within Europe . </s>
the key now be to consolidate and make permanent the progress make to date . </s>
this would ensure that the peripheral country and the ultraperipheral region , the poor region in Europe , be in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of good , person , service and capital exist . </s>
in conclusion , while key infrastructure project have be support by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund have play a very important role in help the less well-off in our society . </s>
the Social Fund have certainly improve our third-level institution , finance our post-leaving certificate programme and put in place comprehensive scheme to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leaver and promote high standard of adult literacy . </s>
Mr President , on numerous occasion in the past I have disagree with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issue . </s>
this time , however , I actually agree with her . </s>
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I can say . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work . </s>
the second point I would like to make be that we would have prefer it if the guideline have be add to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and Mrs McCarthy , as rapporteur for the general regulation , have ask . </s>
unfortunately , this do not happen . </s>
Mr Bernié be not to blame for this as it be a matter for the previous committee . </s>
I be raise the issue just to reiterate Parliament 's position . </s>
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guideline provide they do not deviate from the comment we have make so far . </s>
they be particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission have place on the issue of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunity and transport issue . </s>
personally , I at least be totally in favour of the guideline . </s>
as an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development . </s>
this be not the first time that this issue have not be give the consideration it deserve . </s>
this have be an ongoing concern for the five year that I have be a Member of this Parliament , and I have raise the issue time and time again . </s>
commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article @card@ , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provide for an integrated policy for island . </s>
therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all . </s>
the time have come to implement the programme , and so Member States should also assume their responsibility and do their job properly . </s>
as for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which be sign in May . </s>
I be absolutely certain that this code will be observe and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the development and detail concern the implementation of the programme . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter . </s>
I know many have already do so , but she have indeed earn our praise for be particularly open and attentive to proposal from all side , and I think it be this openness which have give her report the quality we see today . </s>
I share the regret she express , namely that Parliament have become involve rather late in the day as regard these guideline , since by now the procedure for negotiation with the state be so far advance that I can see this report have any sort of immediate effect , which in my view be a pity . </s>
consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guideline for the mid-term review in @card@ , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow @card@ . </s>
in brief , I would like to say that we be enter the period when we be call upon to manage the programming for @card@ , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenge to face . </s>
the first be the harmonisation of national development policy and regional development policy . </s>
subsidy be not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public service be lack . </s>
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interface with the subsidiary national policy for regional development ? </s>
the second challenge be that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical term . </s>
these be two area of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us . </s>
finally , in this time of natural disaster , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural fund . </s>
as you know , it be up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation . </s>
Europe should not be completely absent , as the state tend to want . </s>
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of be unavailable to give a response , even though we be go to be fund a large proportion of the national operation . </s>
I think we should be capable of say this loud and clear . </s>
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there be some publicity give to European aid whenever it be use to repair damage cause by natural disaster or accident . </s>
Mr President , the priority give to financial and monetary criterion reinforce the increase in inequality of every shape and form . </s>
as far as French planning expert be concern , for example , the most probable scenario today be that of the entrenchment of regional disparity within each country . </s>
well , the structural fund have help to apply a brake to this process . </s>
our project of a Europe that aim to satisfy social need envisage the convergence of live condition towards the high common denominator . </s>
its implementation would certainly require extend the scope of redistribution instrument such as the structural fund . </s>
What we be propose specifically be a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the fund use to support the harmonisation of social protection system and the reduction of work hour at European level . </s>
the Commission , however , though bind to issue guideline , do so only reluctantly and in a vague manner . </s>
the report put forward today re-establish its place in the political sphere . </s>
it be one of the step towards a policy of employment and sustainable development . </s>
this be what persuade us to vote in favour of it . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work . </s>
over the come year , face with the challenge of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy . </s>
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resource and capacity , include the structural fund . </s>
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission be not just good intention , but clear guideline and a firm commitment to monitor the way these resource be use by the Member States . </s>
for example , in recent year Italy have have problem in utilise the structural fund , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operator at local level . </s>
There be , therefore , two point to which I would like to draw the Commission 's attention . </s>
firstly , we need to make the well possible use of consultation as a means of ensure proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operator in decision-making , precisely so that imbalance and inequality can be avoid . </s>
secondly , a genuine effort be require to make administrative procedure simple and more transparent , since , they be all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated , to the point of hinder access to the fund . </s>
this be something about which European small and medium-sized business , in particular , tend to complain . </s>
I will conclude , Mr President , by say that the failure of the Commission 's communication to focus on territorial pact and , especially , method of combat unemployment among woman and young people , be cause for serious concern . </s>
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it be a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which have hitherto benefit from Objective 2 funding in particular . </s>
but the report before the House tonight be a prime example of how , if we be not very careful , we can produce very grandiose-sounding idea that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them . </s>
the report itself be well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issue , lack clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability . </s>
that be why I and my Group be propose three key amendment and addition to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it be there to guide . </s>
I would like to explain our thinking here . </s>
firstly , we be concern with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds . </s>
past experience dictate that , as the elect representative of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendment and addition relate to achieve what be know as &quot; value for money &quot; indicator in the grant-giving process . </s>
next , we all too often see vast sum of money be spend on project whose outcome will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period . </s>
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there be no effective way of terminate the project if it have not prove successful . </s>
our addition therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategy so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing cost which be often load onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well-rehearse syndrome of throw good money after bad . </s>
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the fund be disburse . </s>
There should be great involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation . </s>
also the type of project fund need to be shift away from small-scale revenue-based project , which be hard to monitor , towards capital scheme where , in the majority of case , the benefit be there for all to see . </s>
that way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these fund and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the long term on the local tax base in area where such project be locate will be diminish and the European Parliament will show how seriously it take the need for such reform . </s>
if these change to the report be support by the House today , I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieve the historic objective which the fund be set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprive area of the European Union which need to be bring up to a decent standard of living , not by give a hand-out but by give a &quot; hand-up &quot; . </s>
I urge the House to support these change . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which be a meticulous and substantive piece of work . </s>
the European Union 's structural and cohesion policy be , without doubt , essential tool for create the right condition with a view to tackle and reduce the level of economic and social disparity between the region . </s>
despite the step take thus far , these level be still very high , and be unacceptably high as regard unemployment . </s>
these policy objective can only be achieve through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guideline . </s>
let us not forget that when these policy be effective , they also benefit European citizen by directly improve their quality of life . </s>
let us not forget either that great consideration should be give to the island and remote region of the European union because their geographical location be a hindrance to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission be intend to build bridge or underwater tunnel link them to the European mainland . </s>
in closing , I would like to point out that the structural policy as a whole require great flexibility so that they can adapt to change circumstance and thereby respond to the new challenge and opportunity of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the good . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter 's report undoubtedly contain several important observation , and I would like to congratulate her on that . </s>
however , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community 's regional policy . </s>
quite briefly , structural policy do not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravate it . </s>
the agricultural economy and agricultural region have be irreparably damage by the existing regional policy , which have have dramatic consequence on employment level in rural area and on the live condition of farmer , particularly in the South . </s>
regional disparity be become much more marked within the Member States . </s>
if we examine the datum present in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade have witness a proliferation of regional disparity . </s>
little consideration , if any at all , have be give to the great problem face the island region of the union whose shortcoming as regard infrastrucutres structure , transport , communication and energy have result in their gradual depopulation . </s>
the Union 's economic and social policy be just as much to blame for that as its regional policy . </s>
a large section of the Union 's population have strongly condemn this policy for be dangerous and anti grass-roots . </s>
unfortunately , the new guideline seem to be head in the same direction and there be no sign that thing will change once they have be implement . </s>
Mr President , I would like to say a few word in order to highlight two point make in these report which be of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union . </s>
the first be the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion . </s>
we be concern to hear news that the Commission be take this objective less seriously . </s>
we still feel that economic and social cohesion be one of the Union 's fundamental objective . </s>
secondly , I agree with what have already be say on the issue of the island and I would also like to bring the outermost region to your attention . </s>
in future , we would like to see great ambition apply to the subject of the outermost region such as , in my country , the island of the Azores and Madeira . </s>
I would like to ask if the Commission be able to enlighten us on the reason for the delay in the Commission 's report on the outermost region , which have be long await by Parliament ? </s>
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for be willing to include in the report the suggestion we make . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the guideline be intend to help steer the Member States towards achieve the reform objective contain in the programme . </s>
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission 's proposal in this respect be reminiscent to a far great extent of a catalogue of possible measure within the scope of the various policy area . </s>
Nonetheless , their true purpose be to give direction and to set priority . </s>
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contain too little in the way of recommendation to the Member States on simplify administration , and I support the call for negotiation to concentrate on promote a favourable climate for labour-intensive , small and medium-sized enterprise , on set clear objective for alternative source of financing include provision for risk capital and private financing , and on start-up help for company include new information technology and investment in innovative field . </s>
I be particularly in favour of a propose amendment table by my Group to paragraph @card@ , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the project . </s>
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this propose amendment in the part relate to subsidiarity in your positive deliberation . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we uphold unanimously the criterion that it be of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the intervention of the Structural and Cohesion fund which be work for a good opportunity for job for the unemployed and for equality between man and woman . </s>
unfortunately , the excellent Schroedter report do not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there be considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how , in fact , these fund be provide splendid assistance to the most backward region in order to bridge the gulf that separate them from Europe 's most highly-developed region . </s>
they be grow , but only in term of GDP . </s>
they be increase in competitiveness but they be not all experience an increase in wealth because there be no increase in employment and there be still difference in employment opportunity between region . </s>
commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this be our citizen ' great problem . </s>
Please take account , in strategic term , in the revision and in the allocation of reserve , of employment need , because this , fundamentally be what the structural fund and the Cohesion fund require . </s>
Mr President , it be important that the guideline head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programme of the crucial seven-year period @card@ so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for woman and young people , and ensure a balance be strike between economic and social policy and regional policy . </s>
it be particularly important to address those serious issue concern urban area , employment in rural area , aid to agricultural region and equal development opportunity for the island of the European Union and for the Greek island which , of course , comprise half of the island of the Union , as stipulate in Article @card@ of the Treaty . </s>
cohesion policy need to be strengthen further because a Europe which totally disregard the standard of live in its region can neither be reliable or viable . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to express my great interest in listen carefully to the comment , occasional criticism and suggestion that some of you have just make in your speech with reference to Mrs Schroedter 's report . </s>
Everyone understand , Mrs Schroedter , lady and gentleman , the reason and the time limit involve - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limit or delay , since we be discuss this report right now , as the representative for the Commission , I consider that the report have be issue at an opportune moment with regard to the guideline for @card@ as it be now that we be start the new regional programming . </s>
Mrs Schroedter , you quite rightly point out that while it be chiefly up to the Member States and the region to define their own priority in development matter , European Union cofinancing of the programme require , and be the justification for , a situation where Community priority as debate and approve in this House should also be take into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully point out . </s>
so , lady and gentleman , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guideline before mention the principal comment and criticism that you , Mrs Schroedter , and the various member of this House , have make . </s>
regard the role and structure of these guideline , Mr Hatzidakis , Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mention that the purpose of these guideline be to assist national and regional authority in prepare their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their link with the Cohesion Funds . </s>
this mean put forward the Commission 's priority , base on past experience in implement the programme , as well as current Community policy relate to structural operation . </s>
the objective be that these priority should contribute to the good use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wish , of Community involvement , include , Mr Bradbourn , use , if necessary , the performance reserve which be specifically intend to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies . </s>
when I speak of optimum utilisation , I be refer both to the national and regional level . </s>
and so , Mr Seppänen , I shall also mention at this point , speak of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund . </s>
this be the purpose of these guideline . </s>
regard their content , as you know , lady and gentleman of this House , they be focus on three strategic priority that your rapporteur point out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as I understand her presentation just now . </s>
the first priority be to improve the competitiveness of regional economy in order to create , in all sector , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Berend say , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent job , the competitiveness of regional economy , all regional economy , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales . </s>
and , because there be a number of you who have just point out what appear to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economy of the European region handicap by their distance from the centre , be they remote region , island region or , of course , the most remote region which be , naturally , the most distant . </s>
perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro , who ask me about this , that , as I write to the president of each of these most remote region , the Commission do indeed request an extension of several week before publish its anticipated report . </s>
concern the most remote region , it be only quite belatedly that we receive the memorandum from the various government , but this be not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation . </s>
we must therefore take these memorandum into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work . </s>
I myself take part in a meeting of the most remote region on @card@ November and , within the College , we consider that we would need several more week before be able to produce a report that deal appropriately with the extremely serious problem and live up to the expectation of these most remote region . </s>
I would thank you for your understanding in this matter . </s>
so that be the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economy . </s>
the second priority , which several of you have stress , Mr Puerta in particular , but there be other , not that I be mention them in any order of priority , be the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raise the profile of human resource far more so than in the past . </s>
lady and gentleman , we now have a European Union where the disparity between country be observe to be less great , prove the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you write , Mrs Schroedter - an increase gap exist between the @card@ or @card@ rich region and the @card@ or @card@ poor or most disadvantaged region . </s>
this be a situation which be , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable . </s>
as far as I be concerned - take into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this be a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of dedicate all the appropriation for which I be responsible to this improve social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what I once call in this House a two-speed Europe , a Europe of wealthy district but , at the same time , a Europe of impoverished area . </s>
the third objective be urban and rural development , within the scope of a balanced territorial policy . </s>
in fact , the guideline take two horizontal principle into account . </s>
the first be rural development , and let me say , Mrs Schroedter , that I be include in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have be involve in personally for a long time . </s>
I particularly remember the time when I be Minister for the Environment in my own country . </s>
the second principle be that of equal opportunity , particularly for man and woman , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union . </s>
finally , and in order to respond to the concern which you have express in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Schroedter , in these guideline we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategy , for development or redevelopment , which , of all the priority , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measure undertake and to the establishment of a decentralise partnership . </s>
you express some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there be a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guideline . </s>
however , I do wish to mention - since you have ask me to do so - that , as far as I be concern , this partnership - and I spend long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - be a tool , one use to involve local brainpower , be it in the public sector , in the form of elect representative , the social and educational sector , association , or in the private sector ; a decentralise partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to Mrs Angelilli , the territorial pact , which be one of the mean available to this decentralise partnership . </s>
these be the reason why the guideline be present accord to thematic priority , since they must be take into consideration , under each of the objective , to different extent in accordance with the specific situation of each of the Member States and region . </s>
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comment you have make , lady and gentleman , and firstly on procedure . </s>
it be true that consultation with Parliament have only come about at a late date . </s>
let me remind you that when the guideline be adopt by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February @card@ , in line with a new procedure intend to make it easy to present comment on this text , my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , present them to Parliament immediately . </s>
due to the election to the European Parliament take place around this time , however , Parliament be not able to undertake its examination of these guideline until after the text have be definitively adopt , in July @card@ . </s>
here in this Chamber , lady and gentleman , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiation for the programme which be only just begin - Mr Hatzidakis ask me a question about this - as far as Member States be concern , your observation will certainly be take into consideration . </s>
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopt the guideline with what we call the mid-term review in mind , in line with the regulation , then the point of view of this House , as express in this report , will also be take into account . </s>
now to the form . </s>
on the subject of the role of the guideline , Mrs Schroedter , you point out that this be the context in which guideline on a number of European objective , often very precise one , should be provide . </s>
I shall not list them all , but they include implement intersectoral policy , increase efficiency in the use of public fund , assist the various partner in draw up regional or national programming together , etc . </s>
the Commission take note of these , but several of these guideline or these question be relate more to other document , such as the Guide to the reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document . </s>
draw to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenge which you reiterate , Mrs Schroedter . </s>
I be think , for example , of the idea that these guideline be not specific enough in their recommendation . </s>
this claim that your report make must be see in the context of last spring 's negotiation . </s>
the Commission keep to the actual text of Article @card@ of the structural fund regulation , which stipulate that the aim of these guideline be to provide Member States with broad , indicative guideline on relevant and agree Community policy . </s>
I actually quote the text itself , in quotation mark . </s>
moreover , the guideline may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessment which must be the tool use to specify priority and the effectiveness of these programme . </s>
you then mention , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guideline relate to urban and rural development , point out that urban development be not sufficiently take into consideration . </s>
I find the opposite the case . </s>
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attach , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy . </s>
indeed , I have occasion recently to say as much to all the minister responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere . </s>
as regard rural development , which a number of you bring up , particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez , the guideline be in line with the twofold objective mention by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector link with increase competitiveness in rural area , but also protection of the environment and Europe 's rural heritage . </s>
it must , however , be stress that the guideline under discussion be relate only to the Structural Funds , whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority . </s>
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there be also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF guarantee section , aim at promote reform in European agriculture and support the multifunctional aspect of agriculture . </s>
at this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrate into the programming for Objective 2 rural area , in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section be for Objective 1 region . </s>
in any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter . </s>
before conclude , I should like to tell Mr Savary that we be go to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequence of the storm which have strike France , Austria and Germany , in particular , in the last few week , and at the same time we shall once again be discuss , together with my fellow Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , what lesson we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which have also affect the coast of France . </s>
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , sir , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , match your own recommendation regard what action we might take to combat the oil spillage use Objective 2 . </s>
I shall remind you that the Commission be go to be approve the Objective 2 zoning plan for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow . </s>
we shall then have an appropriate tool for work , particularly in the majority of the region affect by the storm . </s>
indeed , this be my reason for pay a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French department which have be severely disabled by the storm . </s>
in conclusion , with thank for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I be very please , apart from a few difference in our assessment of the role of the guideline . </s>
we have discuss this and I have attempt to clarify my point of view . </s>
I be very please with the level of support offer by your house to the Commission in establish these guideline , which have be submit to the Member States for information when establish their own programme . </s>
this can only reinforce the concept base on a number of element of good practice draw from our experience of the current @card@ programme . </s>
I feel this augur well for effective cooperation between our two institution , at this time when programming for the period @card@ be be undertake , good joint working practice , which be , Mr Hatzidakis , back up by something I be very attentive to : observance of the code of conduct which link our two institution . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. M. Social and economic situation and development of the region of the Union the next item be the debate on the report ( A5-0107 / @card@ ) by Mr Berend , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union [ SEC ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0120 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Barnier , lady and gentleman , the sixth periodic report contain a comprehensive and detailed description of the economic and social situation in the Union 's region and of their development trend and represent , as I see it , a solid basis for the formulation of structural policy priority at Union level . </s>
the report demonstrate that - measure in term of gross domestic product per capita - the poor region be begin to catch up and that be how the situation be set to continue . </s>
this can largely be attribute to the structural fund , even though the disparity between the poor and wealthy region be still considerable . </s>
employ European structural fund have already enable convergence in standard of living . </s>
over a ten year period , the gap in average GDP have be reduce by ten percent . </s>
this have particularly affect the four cohesion country - in the positive sense of course - as it have the five former East German Länder . </s>
unfortunately , this European-wide development be due , in the main , to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment . </s>
hence we would urge the Commission and the Member States to give due attention to the effect measure have on employment in future . </s>
the lion 's share of the transfer payment have be , and still be , use for investment in rationalisation and modernisation , with the intention of improve labour productivity . </s>
however , this have dampen the effect of structural policy on employment . </s>
this be not an assessment but , for the moment , merely an observation . </s>
the report establish , however , that regional difference in the labour market have , in fact , continue to increase . </s>
unemployment be currently at @card@ % in @card@ of the weak region . </s>
Ten year ago it be 4 % low , i. E. @card@ % . </s>
and I might just mention that in the @card@ good region unemployment average @card@ % ; it be @card@ % ten year ago , hence there have be an increase of only @card@ % . </s>
the report make clear the fact that @card@ % of unemployment be structural unemployment . </s>
that be why - and this be the conclusion we can draw from this report - promote competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy , in that order . </s>
the corollary to this , it have to be say , be that measure for the retrain and ongoing training of the work force be of no small importance either . </s>
in addition , more attention must be give to boost entrepreneurial potential in small and medium-sized enterprise , and the service they call upon must be develop further . </s>
another conclusion to be draw from the report be that if financial support be to be utilise efficiently , then the measure must be bring into line with the broadly diversified mean of support intend to establish a middle-class and minimum standard of living . </s>
a very important point to my mind . </s>
in the conclusion of this report , we make the Commission aware that the legal base for cooperation between region and Member States and applicant country must be improve and point to how crucial it be for the budget to be consolidate , as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastward . </s>
we call upon those Member States that have not yet submit a satisfactory map of development region to do so immediately and , of course , we expect the Commission to examine with due haste the operational programme for the region for the new support period @card@ to @card@ in the light of the result of the sixth periodic report , and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those area where it be need and in the proper manner . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union constitute a milestone in the analysis of regional datum and highlight the progress make in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report . </s>
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development level in Europe offer a somewhat over-simplify view of the situation and , unfortunately , this be often the message take up in the press and in some speech . </s>
the Commission report generally relativise this observation , particularly when it refer to the social and economic situation of some region of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French overseas department and , more generally , the most remote region . </s>
in this respect , I be please to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have adopt one of my amendment call on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote region and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measure shortly to be adopt under new Article @card@ ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
finally , in my view , this sixth periodic report present interesting argument from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it outline the importance of relation between the central area of Europe and its more remote region . </s>
even if the Commission be still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrate the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union 's structural policy and within the scope of the approach initiate by the SEC . </s>
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agree with the report that Mr Berend have just present and congratulate the author , both on the quality of his conclusion and on his flexibility , which ensure that the different group be able to incorporate amendment in committee . </s>
it must be remember that , currently , the European Union 's overall competitiveness be , in general term , @card@ % of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive unit , that be the region , also improve . </s>
furthermore , this be at a time when technological development , economic globalisation and our problem , which be enlargement and the single currency , demand that the region , as well as business and individual , make more of an effort to be competitive . </s>
the European Commission 's sixth report present very valuable conclusion . </s>
I shall summarise two of those highlight by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative . </s>
the first be that important advance have be make in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have be a major , although not decisive , factor in reduce regional inequality . </s>
the negative conclusion be that the great effort make have be more efficient in harmonise the European region ' GDP and productivity than in harmonise its level of unemployment . </s>
it be therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation . </s>
this , Commissioner , be the first commandment for the come period . </s>
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow member to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speaker have do , to take good note of the conclusion of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period @card@ . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for have take due account of the propose amendment while the committee be debate it . </s>
the sixth periodical report give a basis for assess the implementation of the Union 's regional policy aim . </s>
the report show that growth have be uneven , despite all our effort . </s>
very rapid growth be continue in Central Europe . </s>
the strong regional centre also continue to grow faster than the general European average , whereas many southern European and northern area be develop considerably more slowly . </s>
we now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy be not produce the desire result in all area . </s>
be the reason bureaucracy or be it because insufficient notice have be take of interregional difference , long distance , climate that be too cold or too hot , sparse population and austere condition ? </s>
How can the Union respond to the challenge of global development in a way that the less develop area can remain a part of that development ? </s>
it be also important to discover what the effect of Union enlargement will be on structural fund and the development of the Union 's more remote area . </s>
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility . </s>
some Member States have be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional fund when regional aid come via the Union have be increase . </s>
this have chip away at the result that regional policy have produce . </s>
in the future , we must also develop indicator so that measure can be target at the right time at the right place . </s>
for example , uncontrolled migration have not be give sufficient consideration . </s>
in this connection , too , weight have to be give to the decisive importance of SMEs as employer and force behind regional development . </s>
it be absolutely essential that company in area develop more slowly adopt the late technology and know-how . </s>
our Group be in favour of adopt this report . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union 's regional policy have , until now , not be able to interpret , in any significant way , the exist difference in our inhabitant ' income . </s>
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there be a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrate by the very worrying fact that unemployment have reach , on average , @card@ % in the region bad affect , region which also happen to be poor area , whilst in the @card@ region with the low unemployment , corresponding to the rich area , unemployment stand at just 4 % . </s>
give this situation , the report approve by Parliament must highlight the need for measure that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment : measure such as the appropriate use of structural fund for these purpose , which be often misspend , with centralise state policy and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication system , with the particular aim of integrate the least developed region into the Trans-European rail network , which be due in @card@ . </s>
There should also be measure that respect and develop the resource and capability of these country ' agriculture and fishery , which be often harm by the European Union 's own insensitive policy , as well as the promotion of active policy to create job , particularly for woman and young people . </s>
only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality , which be not the historical product of inherent defect but of marginalisation and economic policy which have have harmful effect . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Berend 's report be precisely in line with the strategy determine by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increase competitiveness be bring right to the fore . </s>
the overarching objective of the structural fund such as job creation , boost equality of opportunity , increase the sustainability of employment and development , be only mention in pass . </s>
this attitude appear to me to be unjustified . </s>
I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be place on these point in the seventh periodic report . </s>
this do not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself be an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 region , that be in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and be only too aware of the problem and concern of small and medium-sized enterprise . </s>
it be absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measure be introduce in the objective 1 region , that be to say job creation measure , special programme for support employment opportunity for woman and initiative to help people set up their own business . </s>
they be support by appropriate European Union structural fund activity . </s>
support only the competitiveness of company will never be able to compensate for the envisage cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there be no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these objective 1 region . </s>
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone do not help to combat unemployment substantiate the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product be need to create any additional job at all . </s>
concentrate to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy be not the answer . </s>
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation . </s>
it be imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we be to have any chance at all of improve the social situation in these area . </s>
the situation vary to an enormous degree throughout the region . </s>
in other word , what be need be a number of accompany measure if anything at all be to be accomplish there . </s>
for example , these would be measure for vocational training , for further education , for re-integrating people who have already be exclude from the production process , for the flexibilisation of work time and work time arrangement , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspect and perhaps also to promote employment opportunity for woman again . </s>
Mr President , my compliment to the rapporteur for his in-depth report . </s>
the key goal of the structural fund be to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the region within the European Union . </s>
by stimulate a diversity of investment , the European Union be endeavour to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment . </s>
from the sixth periodic report on the region , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentive do not always have the desire effect . </s>
the effort make in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 region do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of year , there have be economic growth . </s>
as indicate by the rapporteur , the effect of the structural measure , on the other hand , be minimal as far as employment be concern . </s>
some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid be therefore call for . </s>
also , the observation that the disparity between region within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raise serious question . </s>
Mr President , it therefore seem worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authority , especially in connection with boost employment . </s>
it be , after all , they who have most knowledge about the region which fall under their remit . </s>
by allow them to develop tailor-made plan for the relevant region and , if necessary , tie this in with financial aid , a high return can be achieve . </s>
surely this must be the ultimate goal . </s>
I be therefore in favour of the Commission delegate the practical detail and implementation of measure to the Member States and region . </s>
follow on from this , it be probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to region , to give Member States more say anyway . </s>
by shift the criterion from the region to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problem later on . </s>
finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European country . </s>
the report show that , in general , they be a long way behind Eu country , especially in term of GDP per capita . </s>
with the planned accession of a large number of these country in the foreseeable future , it be a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy . </s>
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of other and call on the Commission to submit proposal for reform sooner rather than later . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , follow close scrutiny of this report one can escape the conclusion that it be possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part . </s>
for example , whilst the disparity between the region have increase rather than decrease , there have be a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect . </s>
equally , unemployment level in the bad affected region barely fall at all , indeed they rise in some case . </s>
I wonder why it be that the structural fund be not employ more efficiently . </s>
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion fund and the structural fund have fail to have the desire effect in all region and country . </s>
since it be the declare aim of all politician throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employ be the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the region by appropriate measure such as increase support for research and development , improvement in infrastructure and raise the level of training . </s>
genuine structural reform and a competition-friendly taxation policy be the cornerstone of a successful economic base . </s>
if we do not wish to stand accuse of pursue a cost-intensive structural policy that do nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measure draw up so far must be analyse . </s>
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union have be a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of job and when there be a significant reduction in the unemployment rate . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , my thank go to the rapporteur for handle this very important report , because development in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizen of Europe will judge that we have be successful in our work . </s>
this issue , which have an impact on their everyday life , be a key issue as regard Eu credibility . </s>
it have to be concede that the Eu have already aid , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor country . </s>
I remember what Portugal and Greece use to be like when I drive through those country for the first time twenty-five year ago . </s>
in this connection , French speaker would speak of a &quot; coup de chapeau &quot; : in other word , I take my hat off to the Eu . </s>
the Eu really deserve such a gesture , but difference between rich and poor area within country be still too great . </s>
What be the result ? </s>
people react by voting with their foot and go where they can earn a crust . </s>
consequently , we have to build school , hospital , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many time over . </s>
this be very costly and it also cause very great social problem . </s>
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they be bear and raise , if they be give the chance to , in other word , if there be work there . </s>
we must give them this opportunity . </s>
this be a moral obligation the Eu and all of us have . </s>
the solution , as I see it , lie in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship . </s>
by entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but create will . </s>
I mean the attitude where a person want to get on in life , whether he or she be an employee , the owner of a business or an official . </s>
What be a fair society ? </s>
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easy for his or her child . </s>
in this way , positive development of the region be also possible , because people will start business and will work if they be give the chance . </s>
finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work be still in fashion and success be an indication of ability and not the object of envy , as it often be here in Europe . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time be limit , I shall get straight to the point . </s>
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruit of growth be not distribute equitably within the Union . </s>
the most remote region , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rate , offer one example of this . </s>
in Reunion , for example , the rate be @card@ % . </s>
this be not a situation relate to the economic climate , however ; rather it be a structural problem , create by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality . </s>
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment be envisage in Article @card@ ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such case . </s>
it only remain to put this principle into practice . </s>
the Commission document expect to be ready in December @card@ be delay until January , then February , and the initial thinking do not fill me with much optimism . </s>
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission . </s>
as regard taxation , state aid , the structural fund and defend our traditional product , practical measure characterise by daring and ambition must be plan as a matter of urgency . </s>
if these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than word for us , and it be to be fear that the structural policy undertake in our region , despite the size of the amount commit , will end in failure . </s>
Mr President , as all the previous speaker have do , I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report . </s>
just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendation it support and your own comment , lady and gentleman , shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we be involve with the programming of appropriation for @card@ . </s>
I should also like to make a few comment , firstly , Mr Berend , regard the assessment you have make of this sixth periodic report . </s>
you point out the quality of the report and you even write , if I be not mistake , that it mark a real improvement in comparison with previous report . </s>
on behalf of all the official of the Commission and my predecessor , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , I must inform you that we be very alert to the evaluation make by this House and by yourself . </s>
the Commission be certainly very anxious to ensure , Mr Berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress have be make and a threshold cross in term of the quality of the analysis submit to you . </s>
I be think in particular of the content of chapter @card@ of this report , where the Commission examine in great detail the economic definition of regional competitiveness and attempt to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be support , improve and influence by factor which some of you - Mr Markov , just now , and Mrs Raschhofer - stress very forcefully . </s>
I be think of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resource potential , small and medium-sized business and direct investment from abroad . </s>
so much for the quality . </s>
I do not wish to spend time right now , Mr Berend , go into detail regard my opinion of the general point which your house have already endorse . </s>
let me just itemise them : the first point concern the usefulness of the conclusion of this report in draw up the priority of the new regional policy , particularly for the negotiation of programming document with the Member States . </s>
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stress , the role of local and regional authority , the private sector , both side of industry , association and local community action group . </s>
regard this problem of partnership , I shall be extremely attentive to ensure that the term of the Structural Funds regulation be apply properly . </s>
thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though I be aware , as Mr van Dam just say , that the prime responsibility be that of the Member States , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of Member States , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we be work in . </s>
Mr Fruteau state just now that the fruit of growth be distribute inequitably . </s>
Mr Fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there be growth , and that we be not work in a period of stagnation or recession , as have be the case in the past . </s>
you will tell me that situation of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike . </s>
I agree with your analysis . </s>
when there be growth , it must be well distribute , but a matter that be even more difficult and which more seriously affect the region handicap by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island region , be the lack of growth which generally characterise the last two decade . </s>
fourthly , a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stress just now , the promotion of an equal opportunity policy for woman and young people . </s>
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium-sized business . </s>
Mr Vatanen express this most forcefully just now . </s>
finally , the positive effect on national administration of the system of management of the Structural Funds , the motive of official in manage these fund , even if it be occasionally complicate , and the importance of once again make improvement to the procedure for the evaluation , follow-up and supervision of the Commission . </s>
in relation to this , I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year @card@ a seminar with national and regional authority on this question of the evaluation of procedure for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural fund . </s>
I should like to mention a few specific point . </s>
Mr Berend , you express a wish that zoning should be implement quickly . </s>
well , we be come to an end of the zoning phase . </s>
tomorrow , the Commission be to decide on the matter for four more country and very soon , I hope , it will be Italy 's turn . </s>
you may therefore be satisfy on this point , since zoning will have be complete for all the country affect by Objective 2 . </s>
regard the informal economy you mention in your report , I be well aware that the analysis and production of statistic on this subject be dependent on the reliability of datum and , as Mr Cocilovo mention , there be clearly a problem with the reliability of this datum . </s>
To a certain extent , they be take into account in the statistic on GDP and labour force survey and , in any case , I wish to point out the effort which Eurostat be make and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistic . </s>
Mr Berend , you also mention , as do Mr Aparicio Sánchez , the lack of reform in the fishery sector . </s>
on this point which be of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this do not necessarily mean that it be an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of region do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context . </s>
this type of sectoral analysis pertain rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries , under Commissioner Fischler . </s>
Nonetheless , I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond well to these concern . </s>
several of you mention point which must be include in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mention some of these . </s>
I wish to assure you , firstly , that the merge of the periodic report and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regard the content of the report on cohesion which be , as far as I be concern , Mr Berend , an extremely important instrument , not only to provide information on what have be achieve in a transparent and rigorous manner , so that future guideline may be examine or evaluate , but also to create a public debate involve the citizen of Europe and , furthermore , with the elect representative , i. e. yourselves , on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy . </s>
in any event , I have take note of your wish to see the follow point include in the report : the definition , compilation and analysis of representative indicator for the region and for all the country of Central and Eastern Europe ; a chapter on the island and most remote region which several of you mention , particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau ; analysis on the competitiveness of the region in the country of Central and Eastern Europe . </s>
this will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the Commission , in the next few year . </s>
and finally , there be the cross-border aspect . </s>
I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendation on all these point . </s>
finally , I should like to mention a few political conclusion which you be , in any case , familiar with , but whose main element I should like to reiterate . </s>
lady and gentleman , considerable progress have be make on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion country , but also frankly , Mr Pohjamo , for the objective 2 region which have suffer some delay in term of development , especially regard infrastructure . </s>
this be my first point regard the policy . </s>
my second point regard the policy be as follow : the structural fund have make , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process . </s>
All the macroeconomic model we be work on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieve in the region whose development be lag behind would not have take place without the structural fund . </s>
I have , however , take note , particularly with regard to the most remote region , Mrs Sudre , Mr Fruteau , and Mr Nogueira Román too , that your observation be that there be still much to do - and this be my third point regard the policy - in term of improve employment take-up aspect , the fight against social exclusion , which be particularly serious and intolerable in many of our region , and the integration of woman and young people into the labour market . </s>
now to my fourth point regard the policy ; enlargement of the Union , the great political and humanist project of the come year for our institution , the major challenge , too , for the European policy on cohesion , a point which Mr van Dam highlight . </s>
I shall say that something be already take shape in Berlin and in the financial instrument available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first country who be go to join us . </s>
I be think in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument , which I shall be responsible for implement in the next few week . </s>
you see , lady and gentleman , we have only just initiate the new programming and we be already consider together the impact of the Union 's enlargement on our structural policy . </s>
this sixth periodic report which you assess as positive on the whole , Mr Berend , be a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself . </s>
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we be already engage in with regard to the forthcoming guideline , as well as for the proper application of the guideline for the period @card@ . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. ( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) adoption of the Minutes of the previous sit the Minutes of yesterday be sit have be distribute . </s>
be there any comment ? </s>
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter refer to in the Minutes . </s>
I refer to item @card@ on the order of business . </s>
firstly , I believe the issue raise by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme be sufficiently important for other speaker who wish to comment briefly on that matter to have be accommodate . </s>
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagree and vote against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group . </s>
the second point I would like to make - and which I would have wish to make yesterday before the vote - be that this Parliament , as other speaker remark yesterday , can only really have an effect if it work in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission . </s>
we should also have the humility to recognise that , if we want to have a strategic debate accompany not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five-year programme , we should have the mechanism in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wish be . </s>
There be one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this . </s>
when there be major set-piece debate schedule between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our line on what be our mutual expectation at least one full work month in advance . </s>
There need firstly to be clarity between all of the group of this House and then between this House and the Commission . </s>
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution create an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationship . </s>
look at some of the press report of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exercise commendable self-restraint in the way they comment publicly . </s>
that be something for which I have a deep appreciation . </s>
I hope that we will learn the lesson and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe be found on a misapprehension as to what be expect rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institution . </s>
it should not be dramatise into something more than that . </s>
thank you very much , Mr Cox . </s>
I understand what you be say . </s>
we have take note of this . </s>
Mr President , concern item @card@ of the Minutes on the order of business , we agree yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda . </s>
however , it be withdraw from the Committee on Budgets last night without be discuss or vote on . </s>
it therefore need to be withdraw from today 's agenda . </s>
Mr Wynn , that make sense . </s>
the report be hereby withdraw from the agenda . </s>
Mr President , regard Mrs Lynne 's comment yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she be talk about the drain because there be a dreadful smell of drain on the fifth floor in the Tower . </s>
this need to be look into because it be clearly an indication that something be seriously wrong . </s>
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this be a serious problem . </s>
Mrs Ahern , we have take note of this . </s>
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which have to do with the ventilator on a particular floor , to the attention of the Quaestors , who be , in fact , responsible for the matter . </s>
we will also pass this on to our service , however . </s>
thank you very much . </s>

Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Commission 's White Paper on modernisation of the European competition rule have ignite intense and lively debate amongst interested member of the public . </s>
the reaction from expert and person affect range from complete rejection to unconditional support . </s>
What be this White Paper , in fact , about ? </s>
the existing system of European competition rule be set up in the early year of the Community . </s>
this system , which be base on a centralise application and approval procedure , be certainly appropriate for the condition prevail at the time . </s>
this procedure make a substantial contribution to the development of a European competition culture . </s>
however , the framework condition have fundamentally change in the @card@ year since it come into be . </s>
the Community of 6 have enlarge to one of @card@ and be set to undergo further enlargement to encompass @card@ member . </s>
but the system have hardly change at all . </s>
that be why there be an urgent need for reform , and no one take issue with this in debate . </s>
nevertheless , certain critic be of the opinion that the Commission 's proposal go too far . </s>
the Commission want to abolish the application and approval procedure and enhance the role of national authority and court in the implementation of the competition rule . </s>
in other word , this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption . </s>
however , the prohibition principle , and this be important , be to be retain . </s>
in principle , I take the view that we ought , when an authority accuse of tend towards bureaucracy and centralism , submit a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation , to at least give this serious consideration . </s>
accord to the Commission 's proposal , it all revolve around competition-inhibiting agreement between enterprise and abuse of powerful position . </s>
however , the notification obligation , with respect to state aid and corporate concentration , be to be retain . </s>
the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs give its blessing in principle to these proposal put forward by the Commission , with only one vote against and two abstention . </s>
however , it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently await bill produce by the Commission be publish . </s>
whilst I may endorse the Commission 's proposal in principle , still there be a number of point that warrant improvement , or at least clarification . </s>
I would like to go into some of these point briefly . </s>
Many critic of the White Paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of Community legislation . </s>
not all national authority , in particular the court , be in a position as yet to fulfil the role the Commission have in mind for them when it come to the application of the competition rule . </s>
firstly , in the course of the last few decade the national monopoly have familiarise themselves with the implementation of the competition rule to an adequate degree . </s>
secondly , the national court will be empower to implement Articles @card@ ( 1 ) , @card@ and @card@ in accordance with the current administration of justice . </s>
Nonetheless , it be still extremely important for the Commission to support the national authority and court with group exemption regulation , guideline and notice . </s>
furthermore , cooperation between the national authority and the Commission , as well as amongst the national authority themselves , must be strengthen . </s>
as far as the competence of the national court be concern , we recommend in this report that specialise court be set up for deal with monopoly law proceeding . </s>
these be already in existence in certain Member States and they have prove successful . </s>
entrepreneur , for their part , fear a loss of legal certainty . </s>
in order to guard against this , the enterprise should , in certain case , continue to have the opportunity of be give prior clarification by the Commission . </s>
these be only a few , albeit central aspect that must be take into account where the modernisation of the European competition rule be concern . </s>
that say , the process be still very much in its infancy . </s>
discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposal be eventually produce . </s>
however , I be convince of the fact that the White Paper have put us on the right path . </s>
a European competition culture have come into be in the course of the last few decade . </s>
the decentralisation propose by the Commission accord with the principle of subsidiarity , which have , in fact , now be firmly establish in the Treaty . </s>
this lead to increase implementation of the European competition rule at national and regional level , thereby make it possible for the European competition culture to be place on a broad basis . </s>
finally , I would like to say that the competition policy reform we be introduce here be a necessity and that it be go to be absolutely necessary , in this context , to clarify that the European Union 's competition policy be an essential pre-requisite to the success of a social market economy . </s>
both the Commission and Parliament must do more than they have do hitherto to get the message across that competition policy , competition between enterprise , and the fact that the European Commission be supervise this , be first and foremost matter which have the interest of the citizen at heart . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , today we be engage in an important debate about the European Union 's competition policy . </s>
we be debate a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopoly law , that be Mr von Wogau 's report , and it be far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have give us reason to believe . </s>
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission 's proposal to be wrong and feel that it remain to be see as to whether we be truly justify in use the term &quot; modernisation &quot; to describe the content of Articles @card@ and @card@ of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression &quot; retrograde step &quot; . </s>
however , we be also discuss the aid report today and the general competition report for @card@ , and my contribution to this joint debate relate to the latter . </s>
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper . </s>
it be all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy . </s>
on read both Commission document , one learn that @card@ be the year in which the modernisation proposal introduce in @card@ be pursue and even partially complete , which be something our own ongoing parliamentary work have teach us . </s>
allow me to make two fundamental comment at this juncture . </s>
as the competent authority , the Commission , with its logically consistent approach , have again and again serve the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprise concern . </s>
it should continue along this path . </s>
but , Commissioner , none of this be to become less complicated in future - one only have to think of the challenge pose by the enlargement of the Union , the deepen of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation . </s>
indeed , it be not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it be about transparency of decision take in individual case , about the possibility of decision actually be able to implement decision , for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population 's acceptance , together with that of the political body and enterprise concern . </s>
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency . </s>
the competition report @card@ be not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there be nothing that could not be further improve upon . </s>
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there be one point that I would just like to go into now . </s>
transparency and accountability belong together . </s>
I do not wish to call the distribution of competence between the Commission and Parliament into question . </s>
the Commission be the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament be a supervisory body , and what good forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one 's decision than a democratically-elected Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ? </s>
here too we should continue along the path we have choose , strengthen and intensify it . </s>
There be one thing I would like to make quite clear though . </s>
Parliament be a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matter of competition law , of all thing , be truly scandalous . </s>
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area . </s>
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful case , even give the Treaty status quo . </s>
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in support us in our call for codecision in legislative procedure . </s>
this will be a good test as to whether there be reasonable cooperation between the two institution . </s>
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition be not , however , an end in itself . </s>
competition be an instrument and do not always produce ideal solution . </s>
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenet of economic theory be that the market be fail in many respect and anyone who take issue with this be nothing more than an ideologue . </s>
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resource and fact . </s>
but optimum efficiency do not necessarily come about of its own accord . </s>
framework condition be indispensable when it come to prevent abuse , monopoly law be one example . </s>
but on the whole , this only serve to prevent abuse ; framework condition alone can achieve socially legitimate goal in isolation . </s>
competition yes , restriction in state aid where necessary and where possible . </s>
however , since state aid form the lion 's share of the competition report @card@ I would still like , regardless of Mr Jonckheer 's report , to say one more thing about it . </s>
it be certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be give to small and medium-sized enterprise involve in research and development for the purpose of educate them in regional and environmental policy . </s>
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provide for such purpose , provide it do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition . </s>
this be precisely the area where it be even more important than it be in monopoly and merger law for decision to be comprehensible . </s>
it be not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of draw distinction and we must assess the different type of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objective . </s>
my last comment be intend not so much for the Commission as for the member of the Group of the European People 's Party . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today be an opinion on the Commission 's annual report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community be authorise under Articles @card@ , @card@ and @card@ of the treaty . </s>
the Commission report be essentially a descriptive report detail the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sector , accord to various typology , such as the method of financing and the objective pursue . </s>
let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspect of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , be in the order of EUR @card@ billion , corresponding to a reduction in the order of @card@ % in relation to the period @card@ , a reduction which be essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany . </s>
To put it plainly , the level of state aid declare , roughly speak , be generally stable during the period under discussion and come to approximately @card@ % of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , coincidentally , of the Community budget for one year . </s>
this be the case , there be considerable disparity between state , which may be measure in various way , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage earner . </s>
I think it be also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be assimilate in some way into state aid . </s>
this clearly show that it be the four country which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other thing , which come at the top of the list . </s>
this be the case , let me now come to the proposal make in the report . </s>
we note , first of all , that the committee consider the datum , as present in the Commission 's annual report , to be in too aggregate a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which be simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interest and extensive in term of compliance with the rule of competition , pursuant to the actual term of the Treaty . </s>
the Commission can only collate and analyse the datum provide by the Member States . </s>
it be therefore down to the state and region to ensure the quality of the datum provide , and our committee consider that additional effort must be make in this respect . </s>
it be in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , have champion the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet . </s>
have good , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objective pursue and the result record , must make it possible for the European commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner study of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policy . </s>
and insofar as such study already exist , to publish more openly its own comment with regard to the objective of the treaty , which be not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion . </s>
by stress , primarily , the quality of the information provide , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it be my honour to present to you , avoid a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid be , in absolute term , either too high or not high enough . </s>
most committee member have seek rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both state and business comply with the competition rule and , on the other hand , acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contribute to the objective of the Treaty , particularly , as I have say already , as regard sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion . </s>
this be the case , various amendment to the rapporteur 's initial draft report be adopt in committee , particularly highlight the need for effective reimbursement of aid find to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of result . </s>
Seven amendment have be retabled for this plenary sit . </s>
most of them be an expression of the political difference among ourselves regard the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the inadequacy , acknowledge or not , of private investment alone , the market failure or inadequacy of the market . </s>
There be in particular one amendment , let me point out , concern the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important . </s>
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stress two thing : firstly , a concern of the member of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee . </s>
the concern involve the pre-accession process for the country of Central and Eastern Europe , in term of competition policy and state aid . </s>
this be undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform us of the late development in the matter , particularly in term of the capacity of the economy involve in the accession process to comply with competition rule and , as far as state aid be concern , the need , in all probability , to have specific rule on state aid use to assist restructuring of their sector . </s>
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regard the future responsibility of the European Parliament in the matter we be discuss , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
as you know , Commissioner , our report argue that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today 's debate concern the steel aid code , that be the state aid in Europe grant in accordance with this code and which be assess by the Commission . </s>
There be a total of @card@ case in @card@ and the Commission submit its own report on these . </s>
the ECSC Treaty be due to expire shortly . </s>
hence , what we must focus on today be the question as to how state aid be to be manage in future . </s>
the European Commission 's decision , which feature in the report , be welcome by the European Parliament , as be the decision to ask for the money back in specific case , thus apply Article @card@ of the ECSC Treaty . </s>
the competitiveness of the European steel industry also form the subject of the Commission 's most recent communication , which we have not yet debate in Parliament . </s>
as in other sector , the general ban on state aid accord to Article @card@ ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also apply to the iron and steel industry . </s>
accord to this article , state aid be irreconcilable with the common market , in principle . </s>
exemption be only permit in precisely define case . </s>
under Article @card@ , the Commission be oblige to supervise state aid . </s>
in @card@ , the large case concern the supply of company capital total EUR @card@ million to the PREUSSAG in Germany . </s>
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intention concern state aid . </s>
the rule pertain to the steel industry be draw up on @card@ December @card@ . </s>
these stipulate that state aid can only be award to the steel industry in particular , precisely-defined case i. e. those involve aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprise cease trading altogether . </s>
in addition , there be a special provision of up to EUR @card@ million for Greece . </s>
however , there be obviously problem with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few year that be not bring fully to bear in the report . </s>
as far as Parliament be concern , it be important for us to waste no time in get down to a debate on the regulation that be to succeed this state aid code once it have expire . </s>
There must be no watering-down of the existing principle underlie the steel aid code . </s>
no one want an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe . </s>
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry have undergo consolidation in the past few year . </s>
consequently , Parliament believe it be necessary for the steel aid code to be amend in the light of the industry 's claim about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the council with follow-up regulation . </s>
we all know that so far the Council have drag its foot with regard to follow-up regulation of this kind . </s>
the reason for this be that people be under the impression that once the steel aid code expire , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission 's supervision . </s>
we therefore demand that once the Treaty expire , steel aid must be regulate by a Council regulation accord to Article @card@ , for that be the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity . </s>
this be the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not cover by the code . </s>
a Council regulation that be directly applicable law must also be observe by the regional government . </s>
What we need to avoid do in the future be compromise competition condition and disturb the balance in the market . </s>
we also need to criticise the Commission 's practice of approve multiple aid package for steel enterprise which in their view , do not fall within the category of the code , even give the fact that the European Court of Justice approve this unequal treatment where certain individual decision be concern . </s>
the Commission will be call upon , in a report that have yet to be compile for the year @card@ , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plan and approve exemption , thus enable a proper assessment of the overall situation to be make . </s>
once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have adopt the draft report unanimously with two abstention , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves create , in plenary sit . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the internal market be not complete . </s>
subsidy , monopoly and barrier to competition be still impede market and development alike . </s>
national government provide subsidy and promise that this be the last time , but then it happen again . </s>
subsidy distort allocation , both within and between country . </s>
a successive phase out of State aid be require , and more and more market must be open up to competition . </s>
this apply to those which have be turn into monopoly , both private and public . </s>
public monopoly be , more often than not , phase out reluctantly . </s>
increase competition and newly establish organisation should be able to provide significant benefit in term of welfare , include within the sphere of education , health care and social service . </s>
public monopoly must be replace by competitive structure . </s>
Europe must be modernise , make more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapt in such a way that it become a more competitive environment for consumer and company . </s>
effective competition push price down and raise standard of living . </s>
it be precisely upon price level that consumer policy have fail to focus sufficiently . </s>
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together . </s>
the internal market be the basis for our work . </s>
its legislation be to apply equally to all , to large and small country alike . </s>
a systematic survey of the various national regulation be need if barrier to competition be to be dismantle . </s>
the Eu 's own regulation too may therefore need to be analyse . </s>
the new model now be test by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy . </s>
in order to be effective , it must be well anchor in the Member States ' national authority . </s>
in six month ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation 's effect upon the Commission 's role . </s>
the question of how good to make further progress have so far be solve through the idea of hold an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopt a broad perspective and involve representative of different interest . </s>
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principle or to return to the more radical change which have be discuss . </s>
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solution and to analyse amendment from the committee debate . </s>
the law must be correctly apply in matter of competition . </s>
wrongly apply competition policy may cause loss in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which be an important and basic principle we should stand up for . </s>
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us . </s>
a conference where the issue be properly debate will make it possible to straighten out misunderstanding , at the same time as perhaps improve upon certain point . </s>
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their effort to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunity and new resource for our citizen . </s>
in fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local example of increase supply and improve quality which have arise precisely because of exposure to competition in area which be previously total monopoly . </s>
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which have be strengthen in the course of consideration of the report by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay . </s>
we hope that the legal point of view will also be accord the importance which be only reasonable in a state base on the rule of law . </s>
Mr President , as a new Member I be please to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there have be a delay . </s>
I would like to begin by thank the rapporteur Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation . </s>
competition be certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy be a success story ; take the energy and telecommunication sector , where there have be a demonstrable lower of price and improvement in quality of service . </s>
All this be to the good of the consumer . </s>
but we have now arrive at a point where we need to develop competition policy further . </s>
the Commission have put forward a new White Paper on this contain two key point : drop the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement . </s>
drop the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration cost , at any rate . </s>
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus be place on the individual in the business world , of course . </s>
it will no longer simply be a case of submit paper and have them approve ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that be probably why there be unease about this in other quarter . </s>
however I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape . </s>
the second point relate to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement . </s>
if we be to create a culture of law in Europe , then there be no doubt that the law must be apply not only by the Commission , by central body , but also by national authority , by national court . </s>
we be not discuss the fact that although every Eu law be only ever decide on centrally , it be precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty . </s>
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprise to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter . </s>
the way to a European monopoly commission must be keep clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion . </s>
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy . </s>
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we be to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid be be grant , then this would encourage the Member States to be more discipline . </s>
however , when it come to what the future hold for competition , there be two issue dear to my heart . </s>
one be subsidiarity . </s>
we all hold the view that competition be vital to the economy and require there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the region . </s>
competition between the region will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union . </s>
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation scheme , saving bank and regional bank , and Gütesiegel . </s>
here , a region have , by its own effort , create a means of market its own product . </s>
this own initiative must not be destroy by European intervention . </s>
I believe there be also a need to raise the de minimis regulation . </s>
we should do everything within our power to force the region into a situation where they have to compete with each other . </s>
my second point relate to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I be not go to talk about market failure just now . </s>
I have already refer to the regional and saving bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hear again and again in certain quarter . </s>
these day , someone who live in an old people 's home be accommodate within the social field . </s>
however , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the way in which the social field , that be evolve structure , stifle competition . </s>
apart from that , I could refer to any customer , any sector , as customer , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social field . </s>
To conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow region and local authority to raise taxis , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe . </s>
thank you very much , Mr Radwan . </s>
I would like to congratulate you on what be refer to in German parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I be speak on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who be unable to attend due to a political commitment . </s>
within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jonckheer report have give rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market . </s>
a slim right-wing majority succeed in remove any reference to market failure . </s>
even if the majority in this House be to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world . </s>
economic relationship in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminate all public intervention in the market do not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resource . </s>
while , since the dawn of time , the market have be the key forum for human interchange , it have never be perfect . </s>
the market favour the short term and immediate profit . </s>
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand be generally to the detriment of the weak party , consumer and worker . </s>
in order to function , the market need rule . </s>
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society . </s>
we European socialist be in favour of a market economy with a social purpose . </s>
the market be not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition . </s>
the European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operator , but public authority must define the rule and objective which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion . </s>
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save job and thus know-how . </s>
the main objective of the Union 's competition policy can be to reduce the overall level of aid . </s>
this aid must be align with the objective of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research . </s>
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinder the internal market . </s>
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid . </s>
the Internet be not a product of the market , but the result of research finance by the American army . </s>
the World Wide Web , which have enable the meteoric development of the information society , be develop by CERN in Geneva , once again with public aid . </s>
the German government 's intervention to save the Holzmann group be criticise as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy . </s>
President Duisenberg even attempt to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism . </s>
I do not hear Mr Duisenberg criticise the intervention of the American monetary authority to save the hedge fund , LTCM . </s>
wish to save @card@ @card@ job be , apparently , a sin against the market , but save capital do not seem to present any problem for the advocate of the free market . </s>
public monies be use in order to repair the damage cause by international speculation , as be the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil . </s>
human labour , on the other hand , be consider to be a simple factor in the equation . </s>
we socialist reject the liberal ' naïve optimism on this point . </s>
we want a true culture of competition in Europe . </s>
the state hand must still be clearly see to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thank Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation . </s>
I want to thank you , Commissioner Monti , for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role . </s>
it be your job to tidy up the mess leave by national government . </s>
these may well have grand vision when it come to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seem boundless . </s>
let me mention the late example we have see : Holzmann , a company which receive considerable aid from the German government ; sawmill in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyard . </s>
these be three area in which many Danish company be experience major problem and be be squeeze out of their market . </s>
I want to say to Mr Poo that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these example show that some Eu Member States be not in a position to restructure their economy and , to that extent , be help to undermine the value of the euro . </s>
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party have table @card@ amendment in the committee , all concern state aid . </s>
these be amendment which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which be very important with a view to make the internal market work . </s>
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague on the committee for support the amendment table by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party . </s>
as I say , our amendment concern transparency , and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urge the Commission to propose uniform criterion and condition for the type of state aid we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that company can predict what their situation will be . </s>
another issue be that of what we be to do when state aid be declare unlawful . </s>
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid be pay back ? </s>
at present , there be no common rule in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonise the rule on repayment . </s>
this be the way forward if we be to ensure uniform condition of competition . </s>
finally , we propose keep both a register , as mention by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid . </s>
you have show us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard . </s>
it be this which inspire us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid . </s>
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendment , and I look forward to your comment and to find out where you stand on this matter . </s>
To conclude , I want to welcome the Commission 's XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work have be do . </s>
but , as I have already mention , our overriding objective ought still to be those of transparency and openness . </s>
There be still a need to tighten up in the area mention , and there be therefore good reason for continue to work resolutely towards solve the problem concern the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid . </s>
this be especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who , in his report , have consider very thoroughly the problem associate with enlargement and with ensure that the applicant country be able to meet our criterion , as well as with ensure common condition of competition . </s>
as liberal and green , we clearly have different opinion on how the world should look , but we be well on the way to agreement as to our objective , and we shall try to find reasonable solution to our problem . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , there be just two question which must be answer . </s>
be state aid to business or inter-company agreement legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exception to the absolute rule of the market economy ? </s>
regard the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirement of sustainable development which the European Union have endorse , it be essential that , in some instance , there be state aid to business , be it in the form of tax exemption , special taxation or even direct aid . </s>
it be also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreement and voluntary restraint agreement , since all these agreement make it possible to reduce the detrimental effect of competition on social or ecological requirement . </s>
so our clear response be that , yes , such aid and such agreement be legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreement must be expressly justify . </s>
the von Wogau report propose refer supervision of the legitimacy of individual case to national level . </s>
we feel this be relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission can do everything . </s>
we demand that the great possible transparency should be in place and that great power of investigation be grant to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exception after the fact . </s>
Mr President , once again we be debate the European Union 's competition policy . </s>
but let us stop to consider the circumstance in which this debate be take place and the conclusion to which it should bring us . </s>
the overriding feature of today 's economy be massive merger and acquisition involve huge company with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational group . </s>
Should we not be discuss this issue ? </s>
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce control on the activity of these private-sector monopoly . </s>
certain sector of European industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have be hard hit by exist competition policy , have suffer tremendously . </s>
they have lose their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundred of thousand of worker have be make redundant . </s>
when will we debate that ? </s>
the scandalous concentration of power in sector of strategic importance be give speculative multinational group economy the size of entire state , and Member States of the Union at that . </s>
and yet , we keep on weaken the public sector and we be ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualify public procurement contract place with public-sector corporation as state aid . </s>
at the same time , unemployment be spiral as a result of the loss of hundred of thousand of job . </s>
worker be face a massive attack on their employment and social right . </s>
consumer see their standard of living be erode , poverty spread and the public sector and production base in most country in the union be dismantle and dissolve in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interest of big business . </s>
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and be totally oppose to it . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the Commission have deploy every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment . </s>
the competition policy have , as far as these resource permit , contribute to this event . </s>
for our part , we remain staunchly oppose to the single currency which , far from bring us the advantage and flexibility of a share currency , imprison us in an artificial straitjacket , which have be impose on the people of Europe . </s>
have say that , govern means planning . </s>
it also mean be responsible and , in this new context which have be force upon us , competition law naturally have an essential role to play . </s>
in this area , the Commission have give priority to a number of route of action : act on the structure of market by actively combat anti-competitive practice , by refocuse its department ' supervisory activity only upon matter with a manifest Community interest and by affirm its intention to modernise competition law . </s>
as regard state aid , it be essential to ensure that regulation be not make more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be record , do not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempt to simplify bureaucratic constraint . </s>
finally , on the subject of modernise the implementation of Articles @card@ and @card@ of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralise application would necessarily be go in the right direction . </s>
the commission be , in fact , retain not only the power to take matter out of the jurisdiction of national authority , but clearly oblige the national jurisdiction to avoid dispute the decision of the Commission at all . </s>
national state would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regard observance of the application of rule which they do not control . </s>
in conclusion , I would say that while some measure be head in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of federalism which , if it be realise , would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the state . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the Commission 's White Paper on competition , particularly as regard the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we be also puzzle by several thing . </s>
first of all , there be a risk that the decentralisation of power , though necessary in many way , will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiative , and that some people will be tempt to use competition law , not as a mean to be resort to when all else fail , of ensure the smooth and predictable functioning of the market , but for the purpose of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy , planning and interference with the natural working of the market themselves , or even for protectionist purpose . </s>
in this respect , we should heed the word of von Eieck , and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni , who warn precisely against the risk of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policy . </s>
state interference in the economy be , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrance place in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European user and consumer . </s>
There be state aid for business - we have already discuss this , there be still a strong public presence in the economy - it be estimate that the Italian Treasury control @card@ % of stock exchange capitalisation ; government and central bank place obstacle in the way of merger and acquisition ; and there have be much talk in recent week about Vodafone 's bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann . </s>
finally , Commissioner , we can forget that large section of the economy be still firmly in the hand of the state , range from state television , which be fund on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the Post Office , to some compulsory insurance scheme , include health and social welfare system , which be manage by inefficient state monopoly which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option . </s>
commissioner , I be quite familiar with the constraint impose by the treaty , but I believe that , it must be emphasise once again that the European economy be find it hard to compete with the American economy , especially because of insufficiently open market and a lack of genuine competition . </s>
What be be do may well be very important , but it be still not sufficient . </s>
Mr President , we be hold a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government 's right and left hand , so to speak . </s>
whilst the EMU criterion be force Member States to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry have so far remain in place . </s>
this be understandable , because it be highly likely that Member state which start to cut back on state aid will cause company to leave , with adverse effect on employment . </s>
but , at the same time , this be not understandable because bad management and non-viable job should not be fund by taxpayer ' money . </s>
in principle , only horizontal regulation be permissible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition . </s>
the rapporteur 's Amendments Nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support . </s>
amendment Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself do not result in the ideal society . </s>
vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit . </s>
market force must be employ in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizen and company . </s>
if this come to nothing , then the government have to step in . </s>
the Commission 's White Paper on modernise competition policy seem more like a discussion paper . </s>
the plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the Directorate-General on competition be a kind gesture , but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary be stretch . </s>
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry . </s>
do the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judge be require to report to the Commission ? </s>
What be the Council 's opinion on this and be the Commissioner prepare to completely reconsider these point ? </s>
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , be not something you can take or leave . </s>
it be there to generate reaction and the White Paper have certainly succeed in do that . </s>
it form a sound basis for discussion and be to be welcome in this sense . </s>
I understand where the author be come from and I share their view . </s>
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessor and that your office will pursue the same objective . </s>
I can imagine the Commission take initiative in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but I have my concern and question nevertheless . </s>
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy 's application . </s>
in general , I be a great defender of cultural diversity but not in term of competitiveness within the internal market . </s>
the internal market need a uniform competition policy , not only in term of concept , but also in term of application . </s>
it be true , there be some European regulation and interpretative statement on the way . </s>
the Commission be also say to have the right of evocation and can give guideline to the national competition authority . </s>
but I still wonder if we do not run the risk of end up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we be able to take two step forward . </s>
so , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the course outline from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible . </s>
secondly , I understand the worry of industry regard legal certainty . </s>
Many dossier be currently be file with precisely this concern . </s>
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future . </s>
in the White Paper , you state that the Commission will still issue particular order which can be use as guideline , but what will your criterion be for grant such order one day but not the next ? </s>
thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission have look into the effect its new approach will have on industrial strategy . </s>
I have particular concern regard the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as be already the case , one have get to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector . </s>
fourthly , I would like to be inform of why the Commission do not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringement of the competition rule . </s>
fifthly , with the pend enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate county will be able to play our game . </s>
they be still in training , as it be . </s>
What guarantee do we have that they will grow into first-class player in the league of the internal market ? </s>
sixthly and lastly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raise in my report on vertical restriction , namely the legal privilege of company lawyer . </s>
if the Commission implement the White Paper objective , it seem to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal adviser will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable . </s>
be the Commission consider take any action to allow in-house lawyer in all Member States legal privilege ? </s>
commissioner , I be ask these question as a defender of the internal market and I hope that , in this sense , we be all partner and that the discussion between these partner do not remain sterile but can bear fruit . </s>
Mr President , I would like , in begin my speech regard the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau . </s>
the fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists be very much in agreement with your report be clearly demonstrate by the fact that only one amendment have be present during this procedure . </s>
we be , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad outline of the White Paper . </s>
since the Treaty enter into force , Community law on competition have be one of the tenet of Community policy . </s>
after almost forty year of be in force , these rule be begin to show sign of exhaustion . </s>
for this reason , modernisation be essential . </s>
that modernisation come to be particularly necessary for five reason . </s>
firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralise application ; thirdly , procedural rule ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape . </s>
the system of individual approval need urgent reform , as be unanimously request by specialise company , academic and lawyer . </s>
I have not attend a single forum of specialist in competition law which have not request a change to the system . </s>
a system , such as the current one , which be capable of make so few decision , be they approval or prohibition , be something less than a valid system . </s>
national competition authority be able to apply Articles @card@ ( 1 ) and @card@ for some time . </s>
however , they could not apply Article @card@ ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevent the coherent application of Article @card@ ( 1 ) . </s>
you will know that there be currently two preliminary issue before the Court of Justice , both bring by German court , which question the feasibility of apply @card@ ( 1 ) without be able to apply @card@ ( 3 ) . </s>
a reform of this point be therefore also necessary . </s>
the procedure in the field of competition be basically contain in Regulation @card@ . </s>
the voice in favour of its amendment be unanimous . </s>
the fact that it do not establish a genuine procedure , that it do not establish time limit , that it do not regulate access for interested party to the file , or that the right to defence be not properly recognise , be factor which lead to the unanimous demand for reform . </s>
the Court of Justice accept some time ago that Community competition law could be apply by the legal body of the Member States and in @card@ , the Commission publish a communication on this subject . </s>
it be therefore necessary to facilitate this approach . </s>
One of the most frequent criticism of Community competition law be its excessive red tape . </s>
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreement be anti-competitive or not depend more on an analysis of their clause than on their effect on the market . </s>
it be therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis . </s>
the White Paper intend to resolve these problem and we therefore support these proposal . </s>
it be also true that we note certain deficiency which have come to light in the report . </s>
amongst these , firstly , be the fact that , despite try to modernise Articles @card@ and @card@ , Article @card@ and not Article @card@ carry exclusive weight . </s>
at the moment , with inter-company agreement and the privatisation of monopoly preserve dominant position and even consolidate them , the combat of abusive conduct be become particularly important . </s>
secondly , Regulation @card@ must be repeal and replace with a new regulation . </s>
for these reason , we be go to vote in favour of the report . </s>
however , if some of the amendment be accept , particularly those present by the PPE-DE Group , we would consider the report to be strip of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lack in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support . </s>
Mr President , amongst the various issue be deal with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mention by Mr Berenguer , that be to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which be the subject of the Commission 's White Paper . </s>
frankly , I believe that this modernisation have be satisfactory . </s>
through his management , Commissioner Monti achieve good result , as do his predecessor and , clearly , he have establish a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market , have be capable of establish the corresponding corrective measure so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately , without the distortion which we economist know may arise when the market be enlarged , as have happen in the European Union since @card@ . </s>
if it function well , if we be satisfy , if the Commission have basically act correctly , why the need for the modification ? </s>
various argument have be present in its favour . </s>
Mr Berenguer make a very accurate analysis , justify the need and the relevant reform for improve the dynamics of competition , but my concern be to ensure that the standard and criterion which will be apply through the corresponding administration in the Member States , be truly identical in all region . </s>
because , if this be not the case , we will be face with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce element of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market . </s>
in that event we would not have move forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union . </s>
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represent by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union , when compare to previous report . </s>
I would also like to highlight the work carry out by the rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , who have dissect this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way . </s>
I would also like to fully support his comment on the need to allow the region - such as the Basque Country , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
nevertheless , I can forget the numerous criticism , both from Member States and from market operator , which , give the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoy by the Commission in its evaluation of specific case , maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rule allow interested party to anticipate the position of the authority and thereby make feasible request for aid aim at the promotion of economic activity and employment , the planning of company merger etc . </s>
the only guarantee have be to seek prior favourable approval , through individual case , which will take more than six or eight month to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply lead to problem of a lack of flexibility , affect the generation of wealth and employment . </s>
I therefore believe that something be miss and I suggest that we establish more regulation , lie down clear rule , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investor , worker and the citizen in general . </s>
Mr President , I would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological change - just look at what be happen in the information technology sector and other sector such as energy and transport - safeguard competition will be of fundamental importance for our future . </s>
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increase employment and wealth , safeguard a competition policy in the Member States be become a crucial factor , and one that be certainly very important for our future . </s>
this be why I give this report my full support . </s>
recently , I have notice that the Commission have be work hard to ensure that this principal be respect in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for product and for service . </s>
I would emphasise that this be go to be extremely important for our future , for Europe 's economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general . </s>
Mr President , for British conservative the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy be at the core of achieve an effective single market across the whole of the European Union . </s>
it therefore follow that any proposal which suggest major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examine . </s>
the truth be that the single market be not yet complete . </s>
during my six month as a Member of this Parliament , I have become acutely aware of the determination of many member to drive forward what be describe as the European project . </s>
we daily hear the need to promote a wide and deep Europe . </s>
but all this , in effect , be so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacle which continue to block the operation of a true European single market . </s>
that be the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposal . </s>
I should like to make it clear that we have the great confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti . </s>
we look to him as the man to root out cartel . </s>
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposal and subject them to rigorous examination . </s>
that be something that have be do by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von Wogau . </s>
I want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he have undertake the preparation of his report - and also for put up with my be such a thorn in his side ! </s>
he mention earlier that the report be carry with a significant majority but not with my support . </s>
so although I may not share his conclusion , I believe he have illustrate in his report many of the issue which the Commission must address . </s>
the first be the potential for renationalisation of competition policy . </s>
I know that the Commission be set against this , but the potential exist . </s>
I remain worry about the capacity of national court and the capacity of the national competition authority . </s>
I remain worry about the whole operation of the judicial process . </s>
I ask Commissioner Monti the other day what happen if he prove to be wrong and there be an effective renationalisation . </s>
Mr von Wogau say we can look to the European Court . </s>
well , we in Britain be look to the European court at the moment . </s>
we find that the European Court be not able to provide us with interim measure in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission . </s>
unless anybody think that this be merely a nationalistic point , in the Factortame case , in which the British government be the defendant , it take ten year for the European Court to give a ruling . </s>
so , judicially , something need to be do . </s>
I ask the Commission what can be do to speed up implementation in this particular area . </s>
in relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point make by Mrs Thyssen . </s>
it be important that business have legal certainty . </s>
I mention this again to Commissioner Monti recently . </s>
he say we must not always be carry along by lawyer . </s>
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom . </s>
we all have , as it be , our history to live with , but it be important that business have legal certainty . </s>
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis have be undertake of the implication of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that be now become so much more European policy . </s>
I know there have be an analysis of the implication for the Commission of the change . </s>
we have be tell how , currently , people 's time be be waste and that the change , therefore , could be beneficial . </s>
but I really feel that , in the circumstance , we want to know what the implication would be for business . </s>
finally , we , as British conservative , be look for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority . </s>
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti have to say about that . </s>
Mr President , the European Union 's competition policy have be of central importance since European integration begin . </s>
it be an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of European integration , between solidarity and cooperation between Member States , with a view to create a good and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentive to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European union as an entity . </s>
it be therefore with some justification that competition policy be one of the most important policy . </s>
we can be proud of a European competition culture , for it be this that will make the social market economy a reality . </s>
we can be proud of monopoly and merger supervision . </s>
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operator , against whom nation-state be no longer able to impose limit . </s>
that be why we should bear in mind what be say by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who describe the state of the world in term of the economy 's reign of terror . </s>
Society be surrender itself to the economy . </s>
that be precisely what we do not want in the European Union . </s>
we be aware that in this age of strategic alliance and millennium merger - in @card@ USD 2 @card@ billion be pay out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practice be be hold in check , not just by our own rule but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan , or other , until we get the international competition law we so badly need . </s>
European competition policy , as we very often forget , be not just important for fair competition as such , but also for price , growth and employment , and hence for the public . </s>
in common with the other member , I call for Parliament to have codecision right where competition law be concern . </s>
it be essential that this long overdue step be take . </s>
it be also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection . </s>
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti want to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he do in the dialogue with non-governmental organisation , consumer protection association and the public . </s>
great transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decision relate to competition policy . </s>
then it be possible to understand that , for example , low electricity and telecommunication price be due to European competition policy , and Brussels should not be pillory when aid decision be take which be , of course , bind to cause problem at a particular moment in time or in a local context . </s>
it be particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rule in view of Eu enlargement . </s>
emphasis must also be place on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report make this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the task of the public sector and ownership structure on an independent basis . </s>
at the same time , it must be make clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offset the deficiency of the market and further Community objective . </s>
a word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles @card@ and @card@ represent a change of direction in monopoly policy . </s>
I be oppose to this , unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that , in competition policy term , the directly applicable exception system be in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain condition be meet , and I believe there be a threat of renationalisation . </s>
the system currently in force create transparency , afford enterprise legal certainty and have , without a shadow of a doubt , lead to discipline and act as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement . </s>
the problem of overwork highlight by the Commission be not a sufficient reason for make radical change to the legal system . </s>
indeed , it be debatable whether this could be carry through at all without amend the Treaty . </s>
Mr President , I be very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mention the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker have do so . </s>
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleash enormous competitive force within European business which be be meet by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportion . </s>
for example , the figure for last year now show that the total value of merger in the European area be EUR @card@ trillion , which be seven time the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in @card@ . </s>
this pose enormous challenge for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those merger be go to be design to protect profit margin of the business from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those business able to operate on a big scale . </s>
Commissioner Monti and his colleague have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worry in the ELDR Group be that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of merger or the monitoring of restrictive practice . </s>
delegation to national authority be all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau say in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authority to ensure that there be no slippage in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random check on that . </s>
Mr President , in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carry out by all the rapporteur and my agreement with many of the thing which have be say here , in particular by Mr Jonckheer , who criticise the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the grant of aid . </s>
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis have be put on the implementation of Article @card@ , especially when we be witness abusive conduct in a context of market concentration . </s>
as a Member for the Basque country , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measure for fair competition in the market . </s>
I say this in case there be any doubt about the criticism which we have direct at the Commission in general , and Mr Monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentive to Basque company and the fact that it consider them to be state aid . </s>
our discrepancy stem from the fact that the Commission continue to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which give our Basque fiscal rule the same nature , foundation and aim as the rule of the Member States of the Union , and that they be apply in a general way to all tax-payer who , by virtue of point which fall under an external system of law , be subject to those rule . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , competition be exactly what we need . </s>
we need competition if there be the least unemployment , for a smooth-running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standard , and , of course , we also need - these be competition criterion to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality product , equal market access condition for all enterprise , and environmentally-friendly product . </s>
in other word , we must succeed in link the competition criterion that be necessary to the economy with those relate to managerial economics . </s>
I often have the impression , unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness be prize above all else and competitiveness relate to managerial economics be disregard , that very often the reverse be the case ; society think almost exclusively in term of managerial economics . </s>
I say that as an entrepreneur who have a vested interest in this . </s>
but a system can function in this way : it will only work if the two aspect go hand in hand . </s>
I will give you an example : the European Union be right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 @card@ job only @card@ remain . </s>
but these be competitive job , for this steelworks be now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany . </s>
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demand the return of the aid that be grant at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region 's employer that small and medium-sized enterprise be , of course , dependent on too . </s>
it go without say that that be not what the European Union 's competition policy be design to achieve . </s>
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirement of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics . </s>
indeed that be the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed region that will protect people 's social welfare and boost purchasing power . </s>
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as oppose to one focus heavily on supply . </s>
Mr President , ever since I be elect to this Parliament in @card@ I have never witness a report which have such anti-Irish sentiment and overtone as the Jonckheer report which we be debate today . </s>
I would like to quote verbatim from the report : &quot; state aid per capita be high in Italy , Germany and Ireland . </s>
Ireland clearly be in the lead when national and Community regional and social fund be put together . </s>
&quot; I believe that the rapporteur be simply play with figure . </s>
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social fund into this mathematical equation . </s>
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union have agree to the new regional aid guideline for the period @card@ plus . </s>
this be merely an extension of the policy objective to complete the internal market within Europe . </s>
regional disparity must be overcome if the internal market be to succeed and prosper . </s>
I welcome the fact that grant aid of @card@ % and a top-up of @card@ % for SMEs for fix investment will be permit for company set up in Objective 1 region in Europe post-2000 . </s>
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish company or foreign company in Ireland still have to cross two sea mass to reach the mainland European marketplace . </s>
no other Member State be at such a disadvantage . </s>
Mr President , the monopoly ' ban be the key element of function competition order in Europe . </s>
the Commission deem the practical administration relate to the monitoring of the monopoly ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with . </s>
but opinion differ as to the solution . </s>
the Commission 's proposal do not formally deviate from the monopoly ban but the upshot of this proposal be a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation . </s>
in other word , we be make the transition from the principle of ban to that of misuse . </s>
both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system . </s>
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to change the law . </s>
we would be change the law to make it executable again , which be something I consider to be unacceptable . </s>
the Commission be give up its monopoly on exemption . </s>
competition restriction be to be automatically exempt against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provision of Article @card@ ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow . </s>
the requirement to lodge application in Brussels will be drop ; in other word , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future . </s>
this be unacceptable to my mind . </s>
the Commission 's programme be to be supplement by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authority and Member States ' court . </s>
but if this take place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here be a patchwork quilt of competition policy . </s>
this be unacceptable in my view . </s>
it would weaken a key element of European policy . </s>
the change of system in European monopoly law that the European Commission be contemplate be high risk as far as competition policy be concern . </s>
There be enough other option in the present system to safeguard open market and free competition . </s>
in any case , the Commission 's proposal refer back to old proposal that be put forward as long ago as the fifty and sixty . </s>
There be no majority for this at the time . </s>
since France lay a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it be damage by concession in agricultural policy . </s>
forty year on , this proposal have again be place on the table and I be certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopoly , to the detriment of Europe 's consumer . </s>
I consider this to be unacceptable . </s>
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I be speak this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen 's document on the Steel Aid Code . </s>
as the Court of Justice recognise in @card@ , the steel industry be particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbance . </s>
indeed , several year ago , this be the conclusion of a report that I compile on the strength and weakness of the European steel sector . </s>
this be why it be justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensure the survival of successful business , even if this be in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty . </s>
this indeed , be the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code , but at the same time it be important to avoid any infringement of the condition of competition and any serious disturbance of the market , hence the importance of regulate such aid . </s>
it be therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and case of company closure . </s>
in the same category of idea , it be essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid grant to their steel company . </s>
the Commission suggest short deadline . </s>
I agree with this request . </s>
like the rapporteur , while I be please with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it do not cover all aspect of the aid . </s>
although the Steel Aid Code be express in a very clear way , the Commission have authorise grant steel company aid which be not cover by the category stipulate by the Code . </s>
in the interest of equality , either the Code must be apply or it must be modify . </s>
finally , and in conclusion , Mr President , with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty , the regulation will have to be review since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond @card@ , and in that case I be in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area . </s>
we therefore await , and I await , the European Commission 's proposal on this matter . </s>
Mr President , I be also go to refer to the report by Mr Langen , which concern aid to the steel industry . </s>
I agree with the rapporteur on two issue . </s>
firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal condition for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid . </s>
we agree with the rapporteur regard his criticism of the fact that , despite the rule lay down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission have frequently authorise aid to company which do not correspond to the category in that Code . </s>
however , the thing that worry us most , Mr President , be the decrease in price , by @card@ % , owe to import . </s>
the reason for this decrease be unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different work condition and condition govern aid . </s>
order in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also speak about this a while ago - have decrease drastically , result in a loss of job . </s>
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now have very serious problem : Asturias . </s>
with global market , we need global employment law and global subsidy . </s>
I know this be difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment law for all worker , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidy for all country , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve job in Europe and outside it . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Director-General , I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report : I welcome the Commission 's open-minded endeavour to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rule , and to propose practical reform measure . </s>
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau , who take up the theme but also make quite plain his demand for clarification , indicate the accompanying measure that need to be take , and pull no punch when it come to the problem currently under discussion . </s>
the White Paper and the report be contribution make at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which have yet to be conclude because there be still a few question pose by ourselves , the judiciary , the Member States , and above all the SMEs concerned , that need to be clarify . </s>
competition policy must continue to be accord central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy . </s>
however , it must be &quot; europeanised &quot; take into account the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility be to fall to the individual , without the Commission give up any of its responsibility . </s>
in practice , only 9 case be reject , @card@ % of the case that the Commission have to process be not deal with formally but by mean of unpublished , non-legally bind administrative communication or on account of the expiry of deadline , which clearly show that the work of the Commission be subject to time-related , staffing and financial limitation in this age of globalisation and Eu enlargement To conclude , I would like to tell you what I be expect from this reform : fair competition and equal competition condition , legal certainty for all enterprise , consistent application of competition policy , procedural simplification accord to the principle of the one-stop-shop , coordination of the national - and to me , independent - competition authority , close cooperation between the national authority and court and the Commission , along with a clear distribution of competence between national authority and court in the application of European competition and monopoly law , and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what be most crucial in the fulfilment of its task as the supreme guardian of the European competition policy . </s>
I be in suspense as to how the discussion , which be broadly base , will be incorporate in the first legislative proposal . </s>
the Commission report confirm that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to business be increase . </s>
the Commission find this worry only from the point of view of the condition of competition . </s>
as far as we be concern , we look at thing from the point of view of the interest of the work class . </s>
society gain nothing from these massive transfer of public fund to private business . </s>
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidy and state aid of various sort have increase by @card@ % during the reference period . </s>
with what aim ? </s>
not to save job . </s>
All these firm have go ahead with job cut and even redundancy . </s>
not to improve work condition , for in increase production with few worker , work condition be make worse . </s>
do these firm need state aid to survive ? </s>
no , car manufacturer have be make colossal profit for year . </s>
state aid be not only counterproductive because , as the Jonckheer report acknowledge , it give rise to subsidy hunting with firm relocate from one country to another , but it be unacceptable because it allocate public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholder . </s>
it be because the rich people be be favour everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection be be reduce , public service be be abandon , hospital be be close . </s>
in voting against the Jonckheer report , I wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , cease all aid to private firm and utilise the money thereby save to develop public service and recruit staff . </s>
Mr President , today 's debate be extremely important because the principle of competition have probably be the cornerstone of the internal market . </s>
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation have implement Articles @card@ to @card@ , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provision which may affect competition . </s>
firstly , fiscal provision of an indirect nature and recently , thank to Commissioner Monti , there have be direct provision , the code of good conduct in particular . </s>
this have work fairly well , but , as in the famous film Casablanca ' time go by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have be apply until now to the new circumstance . </s>
in this respect I have observe a significant consensus in all the intervention . </s>
firstly , it be necessary , in draw up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rule . </s>
it be probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there be confused rule , regulatory vacuum and rule that only lie down undefined legal concept . </s>
this be all the bad - as be the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implement the legislation lie with national authority . </s>
thirdly , it seem to me important that the Commission should play a role in resist the temptation to create independent agency which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international body . </s>
fourthly , and lastly - and this have already be mention - the international legal order have change . </s>
we have see this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we be now see it in the bilateral conference with different region or country of the world . </s>
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application . </s>
we must monitor compliance with environmental standard , employment standard , in order to prevent dump in this area , and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property right and the revision of state aid , which in many industry - as have already be say - distort competition and destroy job within our own territory . </s>
To sum up , we should apply similar condition that will prevent aid , internal distortion by other country , from be transfer to the international arena , in other word , through trickery . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there be much that be good in Mr Jonckheer 's report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sector . </s>
first of all the report reveal Parliament 's single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market function flawlessly . </s>
Many of the report 's conclusion , however , be cause for concern , at least for our group . </s>
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculate on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveal the need for survey such as this . </s>
aid that be base on the self-seeking ambition of a nation give company unfair advantage , thus distort competition and lead to an ineffective , uneconomic division of Europe 's meagre resource . </s>
the form the aid take be important . </s>
form of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary be to be support . </s>
for example , state guarantee , on which the Commission have just publicise its position , must naturally be consider state aid , but they be , in my opinion , a good option than grant aid directly to company . </s>
the report on competition policy further stress the Commission 's confidence in hard and fast rule instead of put the emphasis on economic argument regard efficiency , which affect competitiveness . </s>
the European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desire if we do not show we trust in the market . </s>
if competition policy be to be make subordinate to the aim of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream . </s>
competition policy have to be see as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assess with reference to trade policy and non-material right : we should not just be emphasise its social dimension . </s>
the aim of social policy can be well realise through strong economic growth , not by make compromise with regard to decision on competition policy . </s>
Mr Rapkay 's report also emphasise the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law . </s>
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regard certain basic principle of competition law . </s>
aim instead at harmonise minimum standard will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the low hurdle and end up with the low common denominator , which will water down all the aim of competition policy . </s>
Mr President , Mr Monti , the reform of competition rule call for a commitment by the European Union , not only in the light and as a consequence of change which have take place through the year , but also with a forward-looking view to the Union 's enlargement . </s>
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for his commitment and I welcome his thought . </s>
moreover , I would like to say that I appreciate the remark and observation that Professor Tesauro , Chairman of the Italian competition Authority , send me , and which I be sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration . </s>
our real concern be undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market , and , above all , to achieve consistency between the different national market . </s>
as thing stand , there be considerable difference between them which come to the fore if we compare the English , Italian and French market . </s>
There be a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which be not find in the English market and be only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy . </s>
another issue concern the economy of country involve in enlargement , which may run the risk of remain assist economy for ever more if provision be not make for gradual adjustment . </s>
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant component which characterise our economic structure should be place : small and medium-sized business , which bind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe have always guarantee to the weak part of the economy . </s>
safeguard the social function of the market be what make the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improve people 's quality of life . </s>
a point to consider regard the new rule concern the economy of the outermost region and island , all of which must be protect . </s>
we ought therefore to consider create two focal point of an external market by instigate profitable relation with Russia and the Mediterranean country , precisely so that their economy become less peripheral . </s>
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rule will reflect as many aspect of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guarantee . </s>
Mr President , competition be at the heart of the European internal market policy and be also its driving force . </s>
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , mark by clear , uniform rule . </s>
in his report , Karl von Wogau manage to capture this very well . </s>
but Europe be change . </s>
the economy be grow , we be enlarge to @card@ Member States . </s>
the European Commission will become overburden if it pursue its current policy . </s>
it be therefore necessary to modernise competition policy . </s>
this be not in question . </s>
have say this , I still have concern about the propose decentralisation . </s>
How will the Commission , as keeper of the treaty , guarantee that decision be take uniformly in matter of competition in London , Palermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ? </s>
this be necessary if legal inequality be to be prevent , and issue of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgement be give . </s>
it be not enough to say that , in the Member States , there be already @card@ year ' worth of experience . </s>
in the Netherlands , the competition authority be still in its infancy . </s>
this country have a very small market which , unfortunately , be often at the same time define as the relevant market . </s>
this in contrast to Germany , where a very experience Kartellamt be exercise its power within a gigantic market . </s>
the European Commission 's belief that , in all quarter of the Union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpret in the same way , be what , within catholic circle , we term &quot; foolhardy , &quot; and this be not allow . </s>
uniformity need to be work on . </s>
think of specialist , national court with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court . </s>
this special court in Luxembourg be necessary in order to build up broad expertise . </s>
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interest involve , we can afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounce two year after the event , as be now quite normal . </s>
What be the Commissioner 's opinion of this ? </s>
I would like to finish off by make an important point for small and medium-sized business . </s>
in order to grant small and medium-sized company great security , the European Commission itself need to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized business so that , alongside vertical exemption , horizontal exemption will also be possible . </s>
through cooperation , small , independent firm must be able to stand up to the large chain . </s>
it can be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small business . </s>
moreover , regard these small business , we will have to consider whether it would not be good to apply a system with a prior warning build in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company 's very existence . </s>
Mr President , be the last to speak give me the privilege , Commissioner , of tell you that the majority of this House support your initiative and have express a total , and , I believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat . </s>
but we all want to be oarsman on it . </s>
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you . </s>
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finish touch to this essential reform . </s>
the many idea which have be express here could be put into three broad category . </s>
firstly , there be the concern that some have express , in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception be absolutely compatible with the Treaty . </s>
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be address . </s>
secondly , we have the issue of company ' legal certainty . </s>
it be true , Commissioner , that the Commission be not a machine for manufacture legal certainty . </s>
we all agree on this . </s>
but it be nonetheless true - and this have be repeat from all section of this House - that the European industrial fabric be compose of small and medium-sized business , and that the Commission often play the role of auctoritas , of legitimise the nature of the internal market . </s>
on this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas say . </s>
There have only be nine rejection . </s>
but here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer . </s>
How often have a lawyer with two company and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline give ex ante , change that project in order for it to comply with the competition rule ! </s>
this be therefore an aspect to be consider . </s>
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law . </s>
in this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen can be improve upon . </s>
I believe that biodiversity be good , as be cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that be to say , competition law . </s>
here improvement should be make . </s>
only in certain country , Germany for example , be there specialise jurisdiction . </s>
perhaps this be a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore other . </s>
What we can do , Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - be to give way , and give ammunition , to those who regard the European institution as the property of the great and the good , of the rich , and not of the citizen , or the small and medium business , which , in the bad case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measure will be apply to prevent it - will result in court which make disparate judgement , very late , with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call &quot; le parcours du combatant &quot; , that be to say , after Lord know how many year , when the Court in Luxembourg pass judgement , a Court which we know to be inundate at the moment . </s>
commissioner , it be impossible to overstate the importance of this reform . </s>
it transcend competition , it transcend the cohesion of the internal market . </s>
I believe that it profoundly affect the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration . </s>
therefore , Commissioner , we be rely on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finish touch to a reform which we be all hope for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest show in competition-related subject . </s>
in my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bear this out . </s>
we have hear some very thorough observation which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and be important for the institutional order . </s>
our common aim be to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction . </s>
the guiding thread run through all the aspect of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aim to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weigh down business and take decision-making process closer to the European people . </s>
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examine the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report . </s>
I would like to divide the consideration raise during this debate on the von Wogau report into four group . </s>
I do not consider these consideration to be criticism of the Commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contribution , since justified concern have be express that we both want to overcome . </s>
the group be : the efficiency of the rule , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rule and legal certainty . </s>
I will take these very quickly one at a time . </s>
efficiency : I be convince that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it . </s>
the current notification instrument , lady and gentleman , no longer allow us to reach this objective because it do not guarantee that the Commission be properly inform about the most serious restriction - I would remind you that , in @card@ year , there have only be nine case in which the Commission have decide on prohibition follow notification in the absence of a complaint - nor do it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for business which , in the majority of case , receive a simple comfort letter . </s>
the propose system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restriction , also because it will involve national and competition authority to a great degree in stamp out infringement , and lastly in that it will allow victim of infringement to have direct recourse to national judge , whose mission be to protect the right of individual . </s>
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it be not really necessary , I would like to point out and stress , several time if I may , that the White Paper do not affect merger or state aid in the slight - we be not look for devolution in these area - but that , as far as Regulation @card@ be concern , there be a risk of renationalisation . </s>
of course we have ponder this issue , and we be still study it extremely carefully , and this be also thank to the concern you have voice . </s>
at the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear be justify . </s>
the Commission proposal accord the Commission a central role in establish guideline on competition policy . </s>
the reform do not entail any reduction in the Commission 's activity , but require them to focus on the most important dossier . </s>
the reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I be particularly take with this term , use by Mrs Randzio-Plath , and , moreover , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture . </s>
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition culture be transplant and take root in the European competition culture - where today various small plant thrive , and they be certainly not all the same . </s>
the fifteen set of national provision will gradually be abandon , permit great use of Community law , which a high number of protagonist will be able to apply . </s>
allow me to emphasise that this be communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law . </s>
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rule must be bear in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exaggerate . </s>
as with many other provision of the Treaty , Articles @card@ ( 1 ) and @card@ have , after all , be apply for decade by national authority and judge , and I do not feel that this have create serious problem . </s>
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rule . </s>
the Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provision and through its decision-making practice . </s>
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanism in place to prevent dispute , and the White Paper set out mechanism for information and consultation . </s>
in this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitor implementation . </s>
this then be the idea of monitor implementation . </s>
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up . </s>
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authority and so on , it be evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law be apply by national authority and court . </s>
that be why the Commission want to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application . </s>
this go at least some way towards alleviate your concern , Mrs Peijs . </s>
concern Mr Evans ' point regard the implication for business , it be important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conduct . </s>
the purpose of publish the White Paper be , after all , to collect comment from business as well as from other source . </s>
we have receive many excellent observation and contribution which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business . </s>
we will examine all that material carefully before make a legislative proposal for a new regulation . </s>
There be one point about the impact for firm which be of great importance . </s>
this be raise by Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : the issue of SMEs . </s>
Many speaker have underline this . </s>
the Commission be pay particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs . </s>
we be propose a system which considerably improve legal certainty for SMEs . </s>
why ? </s>
be this simply a political gesture ? </s>
No . </s>
in the system we propose reform our substantive rule in such a way that most SMEs will be cover by block exemption regulation , as in the field of vertical restraint . </s>
most SMEs have in fact less than @card@ % of the market share . </s>
we have a de minimis notice which contain a declaration that since SMEs be not involve in market dominance they be not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article @card@ ( 1 ) . </s>
we be work on further block exemption and guideline which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs , and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs , first by eliminate the bureaucracy result from the present notification system , and secondly , by make Article @card@ ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit SMEs in particular . </s>
the fourth group be legal certainty . </s>
Mr Evans , legal certainty be , of course - and I be the first to acknowledge this - important for business , not just for the legal profession , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe . </s>
legal certainty be important for business : this be a subject , the importance of which the chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , emphasise in her last intervention - and I be very grateful to her for the way she always take the wide interest in subject regard the single market , include , in this case , competition . </s>
I be convince that this proposal will increase legal certainty for business for three reason : by virtue of the direct effect of Article @card@ ( 3 ) , it will permit authorisation , without a prior decision , of all restrictive competition agreement which meet the exemption condition ; it will create the opportunity to help business in the event of doubt over interpretation through the publication of reason opinion ; it will be accompany by exemption regulation and guideline which will clarify the rule and ensure certainty . </s>
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also refer to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyer . </s>
let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounce a ruling on this in @card@ , as you know good than I. this ruling remain valid and there be nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof . </s>
the White Paper require only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examine : the exchange of confidential information . </s>
the guarantee which company must be give be currently under discussion . </s>
( it ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President , to Mr Rapkay 's report , and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement give to the Commission 's XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy . </s>
we share the same basic view but the Rapkay report lay emphasis on several point that we shall need to consider very carefully . </s>
I will mention only two , in order to be brief . </s>
the first be great transparency . </s>
Parliament know how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I do right from the moment I have my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . </s>
as regard the international aspect of competition policy , I can confirm , Mr Rapkay , that the Commission be willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs Randzio-Plath have also draw our attention . </s>
we have very satisfactory bilateral relation with the relevant American , Canadian and Japanese authority as regard competition policy , and we be work to ensure that competition be treat as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation . </s>
Mr Jonckheer , I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union . </s>
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly do not mean I do not consider it important . </s>
it have major institutional implication which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; I be therefore not qualify to give an opinion , and this be obviously a matter for the broad context of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
with regard to your suggestion , Mr Jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short-handed as usual , be fortunately highly qualify , be work hard to produce the register of State aid and the State aid ' scoreboard ' . </s>
I be await with great interest the result of the eighth survey , which , accord to the schedule timeframe , should be be draw up by the staff now , in January , and for adoption by the Commission in March @card@ , to see whether the late trend be confirm . </s>
Mr Jonckheer , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raise the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate country in term of competition in general and of State aid . </s>
I can only say very briefly , that we be actively work with them on a practical level : they be make preparation , they now all have competition law and be set up the relevant authority . </s>
I can also say , in respect of your concern on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , I share - that we be conclude the review of the organisation of environmental State aid . </s>
in connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the point raise by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , among other regard repayment of illegal aid . </s>
in April @card@ , the Commission adopt new rule of Procedure which introduce specific rule on repayment . </s>
in the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rule . </s>
finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although gear more towards a specific sector , be a valuable contribution . </s>
I would like to say that , as we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry do not include individual decision make under the exception procedure , pursuant to Article @card@ of the ECSC Treaty , but address decision which be not cover by the code on aid for the steel sector . </s>
in respect of future provision on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in July @card@ , we will ensure that strict discipline continue to be apply , and the industry itself now agree on the need for this . </s>
when we have finalise our proposal on the new rule and decide on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you . </s>
so , Mr President , I will walk away from this debate , for which I be very grateful to Parliament , in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament 's intellectual and political support , which appear to come from all side of the House , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the Commission be carry out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future . </s>
I be especially grateful for all of this . </s>
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue open with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament . </s>
in this regard , I like your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction . </s>
competition be not an end in itself , as Mr Rapkay rightly point out , but it play an extremely important role in European integration . </s>
as Mr von Wogau say at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition be not an abstract concept : it be in the public interest and form the basis of the social market economy . </s>
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the European integration process , as it have do in the past . </s>
thank you , Commissioner Monti . </s>
the joint debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interest the next item be the report ( A5-0002 / @card@ ) by Mrs Theato , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , contain Parliament 's recommendation to the Commission on introduce protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interest . </s>
Mr President , year after year we learn , mainly from the European court of auditor ' test report , that money be lose to the budget of the European union on account of misdemeanour range from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularity to suspected blatant fraud . </s>
for some time now , these abuse have mean that Parliament have be call upon to initiate measure that should serve to protect the European taxpayer 's money , which , when all be say and do , be what sustain the Union 's budget . </s>
particular attention in this respect should be give to combat fraud , to detect it , punish those guilty of it and prevent it from happen . </s>
create UCLAF by mean of the Task Force and set up the anti-fraud office Olaf be important step , as be the regulation on protect the financial interest of the Community and on local monitoring . </s>
the Union can only impose sanction in the field pertain to administrative law when case be expose . </s>
so far , effort on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtain money to be return only have limit success . </s>
it be for the Member States to undertake criminal measure . </s>
since there be often overlap between the two legal angle and cross-border violation against the Union budget be on the increase - they be also commit by those involve in organise crime - it be unclear as to where the responsibility lie amongst the Member States . </s>
then there be difference between the national legal requirement of the individual Member States , together with protracted or even unfulfilled request for mutual assistance in law enforcement . </s>
What be more , the agreement on the protection of financial interest and the two subsequent protocol sign by the European council in @card@ do nothing to change this . </s>
for it to enter into force , it must be ratify by all @card@ Member States . </s>
after five year only four have do so . </s>
this state of deadlock , which threaten to undermine the credibility of the Union , have inspire Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office . </s>
There be no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim be to equip the union with specific instrument for the protection of its financial interest , that be whilst uphold the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
we be give new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposal that will enable this goal to be realise . </s>
the concern of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as articulate in its position , together with those of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs , will also be take full account of in this process . </s>
we would like to make two recommendation arise from the establishment of Olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the right of individual . </s>
in addition , we need - and this be my first recommendation - a legislative act that include those offence which be to the detriment of the Union 's financial interest , and in which main principle be firmly establish . </s>
I support the propose deadline for the commission be @card@ September in a propose amendment . </s>
the second recommendation relate to criminal proceeding . </s>
the Commission ought - and I have also amend this deadline to @card@ May @card@ - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which have institutional link with the Commission , for coordinate and supervise the legal investigative body OLAF . </s>
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency . </s>
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its task , which be confine to inquiry and criminal prosecution undertake by Olaf into activity which be to the detriment of the Union 's financial interest , and to Olaf 's relationship with the national authority . </s>
There be no question of this influence the administration of justice in the Member States . </s>
the Court of Justice be to monitor the legality of the legislative act . </s>
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office for the protection of the financial interest of the Union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognise study compile by well-known expert , the so-called corpus juris , and of the feasibility study that have subsequently appear . </s>
further support for this proposal be also to be find in the second report of the so-called Five Wise man . </s>
the Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States be equally receptive to the idea . </s>
I call upon you , lady and gentleman , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopt with a large majority . </s>
we can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament be take action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary . </s>
Mr President , I be happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato . </s>
I believe that this be a report for which cooperation between committee have work very well , and the result , which we have receive today , be moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area . </s>
this moderation and thoughtfulness be particularly necessary in the implementation of Article @card@ ( 4 ) . </s>
if we have to give a prise for the article which be most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fight . </s>
the Treaty be a collection of complex article . </s>
however , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourite to win such a prise . </s>
at the same time , it be an especially delicate issue because it deal with the protection of the Community 's financial interest , as Mrs Theato have explain very well . </s>
we be all aware - and this Parliament have be the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interest of the Community . </s>
but be careful . </s>
as the French say , &quot; ne jetton pa le bébé avec l 'eau du Bain &quot; [ let us not throw the baby out with the bath water ] , that be to say , in the protection of the Community 's financial interest , we must respect , on the one hand - as Mrs Theato have say - the competence of the Member States , but also other matter which affect the citizen , which affect the essential guarantee . </s>
the conclusion of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly . </s>
therefore , in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and , of course , as an MEP , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implement by the Commission . </s>
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato say , be a critical report . </s>
it be a report that have be propose by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it be an own-initiative report . </s>
One of the reason why we be very keen to bring this forward be because , whether we like it or not , the European Union have a reputation for fraud and mismanagement . </s>
it be sometimes exaggerated but there it be . </s>
we need to do something about it . </s>
some of the measure we have put in place in the past have not be honour by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States be responsible for implement about @card@ % of the Eu budget . </s>
a lot of them have not sign up to or not ratify the convention on the Protection of Financial Interests , and therefore it be clear that something more radical need to be do . </s>
we need to take this responsibility seriously . </s>
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union . </s>
the question be : who prosecute ? </s>
that be where we really get into difficulty . </s>
whose responsibility be it when you be deal with a body that cross so many frontier ? </s>
we need also to be sensitive to the concern of Member States . </s>
the proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service be a very sensitive one . </s>
we be all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority take precedence over the national judicial authority be a step too far for some people . </s>
but the discussion need to begin and we be therefore call on the IGC to start discussion . </s>
of most importance to Parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the European Union , be how to deal with people who work within the European Union institution . </s>
at a time when we be look at the whole reform process it be critical that we send the right signal . </s>
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecute , and that be not the case at the moment . </s>
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this have be outline by Mrs Palacio . </s>
I should like to make clear that my group be go to propose an amendment delete the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question . </s>
we be aware that it be a delicate debate . </s>
we know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all party . </s>
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor . </s>
but there be a definite commitment to change the status quo which be totally unacceptable . </s>
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulate Mrs Theato on her report . </s>
I think it be a first-class report which will , for the most part , be support by my group . </s>
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have prefer to take it a little further at this stage . </s>
judge from the discussion hold over the past five or six month , this could well be the case . </s>
we all know that , in @card@ , it be agree that the Union 's financial interest should be give good protection under criminal law . </s>
but the Member States fail to cooperate . </s>
this be just a political fact about which little can be do at present , I think . </s>
it be now possible , on the basis of Article @card@ of the Treaty , that the Commission will take new initiative , and I would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the early opportunity . </s>
unlike the previous speaker , who have now disappear , my group be strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor . </s>
my colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he have already publish a report on the same subject matter . </s>
I think what we need be , at European level , to come up with exact definition of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible . </s>
I myself have be involve in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic . </s>
One of the major problem in this area be that if you do something wrong , especially when it come to revenue of the European Union , then this will be term an irregularity in one country and a crime in another . </s>
this , I think , be no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment . </s>
I would like to make one general point on politics . </s>
whatever we may say about the European election , the low turnout be a fact . </s>
we can improve on this by punish crime in Europe quickly , and this must be do at European level . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur . </s>
Mrs Theato 's report may help to restore confidence in European institution . </s>
I believe that be something we be all desperately in need of , bear in mind the result of the last European election and of the level of turnout . </s>
yet , every year we have the same problem . </s>
the court of auditor publish its report , which criticise the Member States on account of various incidence of fraud . </s>
so far , however , the European institution have not have sufficient mean at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually take place and that matter be remedy . </s>
it be precisely this process that undermine confidence every year . </s>
I believe that Mrs Theato 's report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institution take step to ensure that European money be employ in a targeted manner and that no fraud be perpetrate here . </s>
it be important that after the first step , which have already be take , i. e. form Olaf from Uclaf - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for Olaf , in order that Olaf too might operate within a secure legal framework . </s>
we will need the European Public Prosecutor 's Office for this , which will see to it that there be clear legal guarantee , also for suspect . </s>
have say all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be vote for your report as a unite front . </s>
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people . </s>
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgiving to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermine subsidiarity . </s>
but I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato 's report receive more support . </s>
Mr President , we be basically in favour of the resolution that have be table , even if we think that this can only be interpret as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the treaty , so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interest can be guarantee . </s>
the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office and the definition of offence common to all country of the Union be doubtless a good idea , but it be impossible to consider put this into practice without have first introduce a European legal system . </s>
indeed , we be talk about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation be , and will be , fierce . </s>
indeed , it be unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulation solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interest - without first have create a European legal system . </s>
read the precise and comprehensive explanation in the Theato report make you realise just how many problem still need to be resolve and what these problem be . </s>
in any case , this idea must be encourage , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interest that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the treaty . </s>
on behalf of my group , but also personally , I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respect citizen ' right and guarantee , which be to say a legal system that will raise guarantee to the acceptable level hitherto unseen in many States . </s>
therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ; I nevertheless think that this be essentially a subject that should be include on the IGC agenda . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Theato 's report on the protection of the European Union 's financial interest propose centralise criminal proceeding by initially create a European Public Prosecutor . </s>
this proposal be radically oppose to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceeding that lie at the heart of the national legal system must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state . </s>
but the idea of a European Public Prosecutor , on the other hand , aim in the long term to confine the national state to a subordinate role in these matter . </s>
moreover , this proposal be liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reform . </s>
accord to the Theato report , the European Public Prosecutor be need , in particular , in order to well support the inquiry of the anti-fraud office , Olaf . </s>
at the same time , however , we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervise by a European Union court . </s>
in this way , a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one . </s>
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , as the very next thing we will see be a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , supervise by an extension of the power of the European Parliament ? </s>
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we be in danger of upset if we put forward this type of reform , which appear to be quite specific . </s>
in the final analysis , we feel that proposal such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralise and hierarchical form , organise around a superstate . </s>
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wish to see a polycentric Europe with nation link in a network . </s>
and such a network could take the form of improve coordination between national public prosecution authority , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national team specialise in offence involve Community finance . </s>
so the legal framework , Mr President , be already in place . </s>
it be fine , in principle . </s>
it need only be fine-tuned . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Theato be propose institutional revolution for a twofold reason . </s>
public opinion , although indifferent to @card@ million unemployed and thousand of mad cow , be now suppose to be worry about the fraud endanger financial interest and these two reason be suppose to justify a twofold solution : a European criminal code with crime against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General . </s>
Mrs Theato probably forget to include a European prison now that we have the FBI , the European police , in the form of Olaf . </s>
All this would be establish by two regulation , one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code . </s>
the regulation would be adopt pursuant to Article @card@ of the Treaty , i. e. base on secondary law , whose characteristic feature be that it make any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible . </s>
and indeed there be a twofold shift . </s>
firstly , the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor . </s>
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion , while disregard the ten of billion of euros lose due to the Generalised System of Preferences , free trade area , custom present to Chiquita and the billion lose to the fourth resource , GDP , as a result of the budgetary ration pact . </s>
next we have the Puritan shift : the Teutonic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lutheran , Calvinist and Quaker , wish to inflict its moral order on us . </s>
basically , the more we lose our grip on moral , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet . </s>
Mr President , it be essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interest of the European Union , more so these day than there use to be . </s>
the fraud and corruption scandal of the past have have a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe 's citizen . </s>
the credibility of the effort we make here in Parliament to employ our finance properly stand and fall with the effort we make to deal with such scandal and prevent them from arise in the future . </s>
this do not just mean administrative change but also structural change ; in other word we must create instrument which be actually capable of afford protection under criminal law . </s>
the Intergovernmental Conference @card@ will provide the appropriate forum for discuss this . </s>
now it be , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceeding law be intrinsically matter pertain to the law of the Member States and it be quite unthinkable that they should be govern by the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
There be no doubt that I myself be one of the advocate of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competence at European level . </s>
when it come to the demand make on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it be the call for there to be clear delimitation of competence that should take centre stage . </s>
now that be not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceeding law , as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report , be actually about take action in the Eu 's own interest , which , as far as that go , do not damage the legal interest of the Member States ; on the contrary , it protect them , at least indirectly . </s>
the compatibility with the various national system of law , as confirm by expert , show that criminal law be another area where Europe have a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offence we have be discuss here be concern . </s>
take these aspect into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as propose , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of Olaf . </s>
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involve Eu fund ? </s>
I do not believe so . </s>
on the other hand , we can go a long way use the existing tool . </s>
an alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , as propose at the last Summit . </s>
in the way it be structure , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigation into crime . </s>
it be just such practical cooperation there be a need for . </s>
Olaf , Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in criminal matter should be use fully and , when the Fraud Convention from @card@ be at long last ratify in the Member States , we can also achieve a lot with this . </s>
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it be quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratify this agreement . </s>
it be simply too bad , and I can well understand why people be become impatient and demand that we have a common European Public Prosecutor 's office instead . </s>
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office . </s>
it be , after all , only the most serious crime which would have consequence under criminal law . </s>
Ninety per cent of case would be disciplinary matter concern negligence or incompetence . </s>
instead , there be a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily . </s>
we should alter the staff regulation and disciplinary procedure and , especially , change our practice . </s>
at the moment , Article @card@ of the staff regulation concern dismissal on the ground of gross negligence be never use . </s>
Should we not make a point of clean up our own act and put our own house in order before we plunge into construct grand new institution ! </s>
Mr President , we all want to do something about combat European fraud . </s>
but the question be now : be the European Union do anything about it as well ? </s>
the answer to this be that we know very little about this . </s>
the Tampere Summit be about combat crime . </s>
Everyone be supposedly please about it but , in reality , we have make little progress . </s>
There be no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as be state before , have not ratify the treaty text submit . </s>
so a great deal have to be do in this area . </s>
and what exactly should be do ? </s>
Two thing , and Mrs Theato 's report clearly spell these out . </s>
firstly , the same penalty clause regard European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union . </s>
so , unification in this small area . </s>
secondly , we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor 's Office with two task , firstly to assist the national public prosecutor , help bring criminal proceeding in European fraud case and , secondly , to supervise Europol and Olaf in a judicial sense because these be two criminal investigation service which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision . </s>
the European Public Prosecutor 's office be nothing to be afraid of . </s>
I feel there be a lot of scaremongering go on . </s>
it be , in fact , something very positive . </s>
just like Europol . </s>
Europol , involve police cooperation , do not rank above the national police force , but be there for the purpose of exchange information between police force . </s>
this be exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Prosecutor 's Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage . </s>
Parliament support this . </s>
the Committee of Wise Men support this . </s>
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same . </s>
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris . </s>
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan say on this issue . </s>
corpus juris be something that be set up without any kind of public debate or public participation . </s>
the idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with override jurisdiction throughout Eu territory would have a major impact on the traditional system both in Ireland and the UK . </s>
the idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor be something which Member States have a right to be inform about . </s>
indeed when the plan be initially draw up they say it would be restrict to case of fraud against the Eu budget . </s>
but when corpus juris be actually launch in @card@ in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of @card@ jurist , with no medium invite - the President of the European Parliament at the time , Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado , say that he consider it embryonic and that the intention be to extend Eu competence in criminal matter to all area of criminal activity . </s>
we need a public debate on this . </s>
we need the Member States and the citizen in the Member States to be properly inform . </s>
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK need to be address . </s>
There need to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there have be to date . </s>
it be unacceptable that something like this have be foist on the Member States of the Eu without any proper public debate . </s>
Mr President , on behalf of the Italian radical member , I abstain on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control , because I share the concern that have be voice , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which be certainly important : common law . </s>
with this text we be undoubtedly force the issue , since we believe that there be point that must be resolve and it be important for Community fraud to be curb , to be crush . </s>
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intend to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair , Mrs Theato , will not be without its critic . </s>
another major criticism of the text concern secondary law . </s>
article @card@ of the Treaty allow the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instrument to curb fraud . </s>
nevertheless , we be left feel slightly perplex that they envisage an institution which will mean high quality , without immediately plan how to deal with the repercussion of this . </s>
that be to say , they be neglect the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system . </s>
we want to express our perplexity as regard these point by abstain in committee . </s>
Mr President , we need to speak our mind on this subject in the European Parliament , during the plenary sitting and in the committee , even if it be obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the place where institutional issue be address . </s>
we find ourselves deal with some very serious event , which in the past seem to be the norm . </s>
today , something have change , at least in term of mechanism , and especially as regard monitoring , but we be still not satisfy , particularly if debate be hold in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor , crime , fraud , the misappropriation of fund and the disclosure of confidential information pertain to one 's office at European level . </s>
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community 's interest , its image and its relationship with taxpayer , who be an indispensable and essential part of Community life . </s>
for this reason , it be right to look at the issue of safeguard common interest , and to establish good link with legal system within the individual States . </s>
in this respect , we be face with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relation with the individual national community and their domestic legal system ? </s>
this issue need to be explore further in both cultural and practical term . </s>
today , we run the risk of add a new institution to the already numerous and varied institution which exist within each country . </s>
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular point . </s>
firstly , I would not wish to take up the philosophical issue of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States , although I be very much in favour of have such a debate , for my regular viewing of British television programme have show me what the national politician be conjure up there in the way of threat pose by the continent to the home-grown legal system . </s>
sometimes it be worthy of satire and merit discussion , but I digress . </s>
the point I want to make relate to Mrs Theato 's report . </s>
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulty be concern that we be face here - and the European Union evidently have only very limited room for manoeuvre when it come to make these offence litigable as European criminal offence - we have become embroil in legality . </s>
I be refer to Recommendations 1 and 2 . </s>
after all , there be no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor , rather , for legal reason it have now become an independent , European authority , or &quot; body &quot; to quote Mrs Theato . </s>
we obviously have difficulty there with regard to the legal basis . </s>
we also face difficulty with regard to offence . </s>
nothing have change there . </s>
as have always be the case , there be offence that transcend European offence , as it be , or at least there be the potential for them to do so , and these might include money-laundering , receive steal good , and form a criminal organisation . </s>
as far as that be concerned , I believe there be judicial uncertainty that need to be overcome . </s>
What Parliament need to do as a matter of urgency though - and this be why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendation - be to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affair . </s>
Mr President , for year , Parliament have call for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interest . </s>
frustration inevitably set in when we see the weakness of the convention ( and of the protocol relate to this protection ) which , five year after be sign , have still not be ratify and have still not come into force . </s>
on the other hand , more pro-active attempt , such as Olaf , which be currently operate , have not allay legitimate concern about the system of guarantee for individual right . </s>
the proposal in Mrs Theato 's report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interest , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the Community budget . </s>
these proposal represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community . </s>
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigation by Olaf , without harm the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice . </s>
finally , follow on from what be agree in Tampere , the report restate the need for a European Public Prosecutor . </s>
this issue have be bring once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino 's timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone consider vital . </s>
we should approve this report because it highlight the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institution , by protect the Union 's financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which be capable of maintain the credibility of the Community 's economic life . </s>
nevertheless , it raise some very basic question . </s>
be there currently a sufficient legal basis for justify , in legal term , the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which , although it might be call subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain area , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the Member States ? </s>
as there be doubt , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorporate these proposal into the more general reform of the Union 's legal system along the line of what be be request for the European Public Prosecutor ? </s>
surely these subject will be of the great relevance to a revision of the treaty which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ? </s>
Mr President , the Eu be now expose to tough scrutiny . </s>
confidence in the European Union have be seriously damage . </s>
To remedy this , vigorous effort be require . </s>
we therefore welcome increase resource for Olaf so that we can investigate any suspicion more efficiently . </s>
at the same time , we think it be obvious that those who commit crime against the Eu must be able to be hold accountable in an effective way . </s>
it be unfortunate that the convention for protect the Union 's financial interest have be put into effect in so few Member States . </s>
we therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of table proposal entail the further development of the already existing legal framework . </s>
on the other hand , I be not convince that make the process more efficient in this way require common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime . </s>
in the present situation , I be therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it be scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty . </s>
we have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecutor from the individual nation cooperate . </s>
the major problem be not that no measure be be take against crime commit against the Union but , rather , that these be commit so often and far too seldom discover . </s>
the challenge for the Commission and for ourselves be , however , to find the right mix . </s>
the mismanagement and example of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our end up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevent the development of a modern administration . </s>
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten 's report . </s>
the main idea ought to be that each administration take responsibility for its own supervision . </s>
our experience of modern administration tell us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation be often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision . </s>
the major challenge be , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromise on supervision and the rule of law . </s>
this require staff training , more modern recruitment method and , above all , openness and public control . </s>
be able to scrutinise the administration effectively be the good protection against irregularity . </s>
Mr President , rapporteur , restore the confidence of the citizen in the work of the European institution and in European politics be one of the most important task we have before us . </s>
the Commission have give its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reform document this . </s>
Parliament be commit to this task , which be something this report bear impressive witness to . </s>
on behalf of the Commission I be able to congratulate the rapporteur on have again address the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in term of create legal base and effect institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrate against the European Union . </s>
on ratify the Amsterdam Treaty , all Member States state that they want to accord combat fraud against the financial interest of the European Union the same priority as combat fraud to their own detriment . </s>
yet as thing stand , only the first four Member States have ratify the agreement conclude in @card@ . </s>
the Commission wholeheartedly agree with the rapporteur that this be an unacceptable situation a legislative act , a directive , in which there be a standardise definition for the different type of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceeding be enshrine as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste . </s>
Olaf , the European anti-fraud office be one of the most important instrument the Commission have for fulfill its obligation to combat fraud . </s>
accordingly , the Commission refuse to put up with the fact that both European bank , the ECB and the EIB , contest the right of Olaf to include these two institution in its investigation , cite their independent status . </s>

the second recommendation in this report relate to assess the legitimacy of the investigative measure undertake by Olaf in the various European institution . </s>
it be the task of the monitor committee for Olaf , which be set up at the same time as Olaf , to safeguard the independence of Olaf , however it can undertake the action mention in the report of monitor internal investigative activity conduct by Olaf . </s>
I be fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point . </s>
in other word , there be a loophole here which must be fill and I will examine the solution advocate in the report in the interest of move thing on . </s>
There be one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extend the legal basis for Olaf from lead to the misconception that Olaf do not now have enough authority . </s>
no , there must be no undermine of Olaf 's authority , and neither do I think this be the rapporteur 's intention . </s>
as such , I would ask you to give Olaf 's work your full support , also in its present form . </s>
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer . </s>

Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules @card@ ( 2 ) and @card@ ( 4 ) . </s>
these be both about voting . </s>
be it not the case that on vote other than roll-call vote , the vote should take place initially by show of hand and only then , if there be some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ? </s>
that be quite right , Mr Heaton-Harris . </s>
I put the matter to a vote by a show of hand because none of the group have request voting by roll call . </s>
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only take place if member of the House request it . </s>
in this particular case , I can assure you there be a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just vote on . </s>
Mr President , I be not refer to that particular vote but to vote in general . </s>
it be obvious that some president do not look at the hand , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system . </s>
I be wonder whether this be the correct procedure . </s>
I know it take longer , but should we not always have a show of hand first ? </s>
I shall , I assure you , Mr Heaton-Harris , pay particular attention to the show of hand . </s>
I hope to see many hand raise when the time come to vote . </s>

the European budget be effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP , especially now that the Community preference system have be abandon and the multiplication of free trade area have put pay to custom duty and the common agricultural levy , which have already be cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences . </s>
since then , Community VAT fraud and distortion in the calculation of GDP , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have have a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resource . </s>
since then , of course , this Europe with pretension to federalism be now more than ever finance like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually be , but which it refuse to see itself as . </s>
this can be clearly see in the regulation before us . </s>
it show a concern with the accounting involve own resource , the process of make them available or with the monitoring of declare amount make available to the Commission . </s>
furthermore , the new Advisory Committee that have be create be make up of representative of the taxpaying Member States . </s>
this be a long way from offshoot such as the &quot; Community criminal code &quot; , the &quot; European Public Prosecutor &quot; or a European police force , with Olaf . </s>
There be as yet no federal European tax . </s>
All the same , a Europe with @card@ member will be want a European tax on income , if not on profit , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for @card@ . </s>
Koch Report ( A5-0105 / @card@ ) - ( FR ) it be with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improve harmonisation in the training of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good . </s>
in recent year , the transportation of dangerous good nationally and internationally have increase considerably , increase the risk of accident . </s>
some of these risk be due to an inadequate awareness of the risk inherent in such transportation . </s>
it therefore prove necessary , in the context of establish the internal market , to adopt some measure intend to ensure good risk prevention . </s>
directive @card@ / @card@ / EC be a response to this requirement . </s>
firm involve in the transport of dangerous good and in the loading and unload operation relate to such transportation have be oblige , quite rightly , to comply with regulation regard risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport be involve . </s>
in order to facilitate achieve this objective , Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC provide for the appointment of safety adviser for dangerous good who would have appropriate professional training . </s>
this professional training would be target at awareness of the term of the legislation , regulation and administrative condition applicable to such transport . </s>
while this represent significant progress at the time , the lack of specific term govern the harmonisation of examination requirement prove to be a problem . </s>
it therefore seem essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardise , high-level training of safety adviser , but also in order to avoid any disparity between the cost of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firm of different Member Sates . </s>
the Commission proposal seek to ensure that the training of safety adviser be standardise . </s>
it outline the minimum content of examination and define the role of the authorise body as well as the requirement demand of the examine body . </s>
Parliament vote in favour of this text . </s>
it do , however , table a number of amendment , most of which be adopt in the Council 's common position , particularly regard the need to draw up a questionnaire and statement on the authorisation of some document in the context of the ' specification of the examination arrangement propose by the examination body ' . </s>
in order to be realistic , I further support postpone the date for the application of these condition until three month after the directive itself come into force . </s>
I shall conclude by emphasise that harmonise the professional qualification of adviser will contribute to improve the quality of the service in the interest of user , to minimise the risk of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous good . </s>
Koch Report ( A5-0104 / @card@ ) last October I express my view on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous good by rail . </s>
the view I shall express today be not far remove from those I have then . </s>
essentially , my opinion be as follow : I deplore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous good , we keep put off the adoption of harmonise standard to the detriment of human being and the environment . </s>
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous good by road come into force on 1 January @card@ . </s>
this include a number of interim condition valid until 1 January @card@ . </s>
this be the time when we should have express our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogation . </s>
in line with the usual procedure , it be the European Committee for Standardisation ( Cen ) which put forward standard in this area , and they be then integrate in to the European agreement concern the International Carriage of dangerous Goods by Road sign in Geneva in @card@ ( know generally as ADR ) , applicable throughout Europe , whose term and condition form the basis for the legislation applicable within the Eu . </s>
the Cen have be unable to complete its work in the time allot . </s>
consequently , the Commission proposal under discussion today be intend to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problem , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangement , as should have be the case ! </s>
this be exactly what happen in the case of transport of such good by rail , except for the fact that a time limit have be decide . </s>
right now we do not have the slight idea as to when the Cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposal . </s>
until then , there be really no point in Member States amend their national regulation . </s>
the report also accept that some flexibility may be adopt , and grant state the option of adopt or apply alternative standard . </s>
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standard regard certain type of pressure vessel use for transportation , where there be no applicable European standard . </s>
they may also adopt alternative condition for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation . </s>
in offer this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wish to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern . </s>
Schroedter Report ( A5-0108 / @card@ ) Mr President , I want to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation follow on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development . </s>
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparity in wealth which continue to exist between the different region in Europe . </s>
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparity in employment continue to give cause for concern . </s>
despite the fact that the Community , through the structural fund among other , inject considerable sum into combat the disparity between regional development opportunity in Europe , these disparity continue to exist . </s>
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , base on very strict evaluation , change its course and change its objective in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparity in wealth and employment more effectively . </s>
Mr President , in relation to the Schroedter report , I be aware , and have have it confirm to me by Mr Barnier , that the rule on additionality concern structural fund apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-govern region such as Wales or Scotland . </s>
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affair . </s>
I hope we can revisit this issue at a late time . </s>
I want it to be clear that though I vote in favour of the report , I have this important reservation . </s>
- the Schroedter report speak of the need to promote partnership with regard to the spending of Eu Structural Funds in Europe for the period @card@ . </s>
I believe that this be particularly important as Eu Structural Funds be always spend in a manner which maximise the economic development of different region when local and regional authority be involve in the decision-making process for the spending of such fund . </s>
as a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , I have always support the need for the implementation of bottom-up scheme support by national Eu fund . </s>
I believe that the Irish government and the European Commission and different Eu government can alone decide on specific spending priority . </s>
I believe that local authority and group from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involve in the decision-making process for the spending of European structural fund . </s>
for example , we have see the success of the Leader I and Leader II scheme in Ireland in term of the job which have be create through the administration of these programme in rural part of Ireland and within Europe . </s>
the Leader III scheme be set to be implement some time later this year . </s>
the Leader programme at its core afford an opportunity for public , private and voluntary group to pool their collective talent so as to create long-term and sustainable job in small and medium-sized enterprise in rural area . </s>
this be a classic example of how the partnership concept operate and such scheme must be support in its broad remit . </s>
the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund have also be a success in create job in border county in Ireland . </s>
once again , there be active participation from group from the private , public and voluntary sector which suggest how good particular funding can be spend so as to help different local job creation project within this region . </s>
during the next round of Eu Structural Funds @card@ , other Eu initiative such as &quot; Equal &quot; and &quot; Urban &quot; will be operate . </s>
these initiative must also involve the participation of local authority and local community in an effort to identify where good European structural fund should be spend . </s>
the rapporteur refer to the need to implement an integrated approach to new Eu Structural Fund plan and programme . </s>
they must promote a decentralise , efficient and comprehensive partnership base on the skill and commitment of all sector in regional and local authority . </s>
this be very sensible because key economic and social difficulty in our country can be overcome unless there be key integration between national , European and local funding . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) this report take us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy . </s>
in order to reduce disparity between region , of course . </s>
but more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantee us improve function of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality . </s>
Jacques Delors be accustom to say that the market be short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparity . </s>
it be precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lie behind the European social model , which we be all in favour of , and which give rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion . </s>
this be a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affair , draw up in collaboration with Member States , region and local community , with the Commission itself responsible for issue guideline in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objective require in the context of programming . </s>
this be why I shall support this report , despite regret the fact that , for timetabling reason , the European Parliament be only consult at a very late date on the guideline intend to assist Member States , region and local community in the programming of Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 . </s>
moreover , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , add a whole raft of thought on key area such as combat social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy . </s>
Mrs Schroedter 's report mark a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid . </s>
it highlight the increase vital role of all the party involve , chiefly those involve at a local level , who be the only one able to define specific requirement and social problem , hence our determination to ensure that the partnership to be establish be true partnership , which be decentralise and involve all the agent concern . </s>
this be the reason for the request which we be put forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid . </s>
in order to do so , the monitoring committee must be open to include member of the European Parliament , association and industrialist concern by the project and also civil society . </s>
these guideline represent a step towards the improve effectiveness of Community structural aid . </s>
amend again as such by the Schroedter report , they be a step in the right direction . </s>
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after @card@ , but that be another subject . </s>
in the meantime , let us support this first step . </s>
- this report call for drastic cut in the level of illegal state aid dish out by some Member States . </s>
although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminate altogether . </s>
in my mind , illegal state aid amount to little more than state-sponsor social dump . </s>
we all oppose social dump when perpetrate by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrate by government . </s>
if we be to have an effective single market that make European industry globally competitive and generate wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level play field . </s>
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroy competitive company and create unemployment . </s>
There be , of course , case when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example help company restructure . </s>
in all such case , however , strict criterion must be meet and prior approval from the European Commission gain . </s>
whether we be talk about beef to France or about backhander to industry , Eu Member States must not be allow to flout the law . </s>
I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a &quot; scoreboard &quot; show the amount of state aid per Member State . </s>
country that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rule should be name and shame and their hypocrisy reveal . </s>
Member States can be allow to proclaim European solidarity in public while try to undermine the single market in private . </s>
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that level of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be fall . </s>
much remain to be do , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tough in expose the subsidy junkie of Europe . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) the Commission 's main instrument for overcome regional disparity be the structural fund and the Cohesion Fund . </s>
it be therefore crucial that the European Parliament draft its broad indicative guideline without threaten the principle of subsidiarity , give that establish the development strategy for each country fall to the respective Member States . </s>
unfortunately , the European Commission have already move ahead with its guideline and Parliament 's position on the programme for @card@ do not carry much weight . </s>
it be nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these fund to be the development of the country and region with the great problem and of the outermost region , of which the Portuguese region of the Azores and Madeira be example . </s>
this must be do with the objective of achieve economic and social cohesion . </s>
the truth be though , that the Commission 's guideline do not fully meet these objective . </s>
on the other hand , it be crucial that there be precise indication and sufficient fund in area such as create decent job - with right - effectively promote equality in law and opportunity , and support the social economy and solidarity . </s>
There must also be support for rural development , for small and medium-sized enterprise , for improve the quality of life of urban population in deprive area , specifically in the field of social housing , with a view to achieve sustainable urban development . </s>
. </s>
( it ) while Article @card@ of the EC Treaty aim to promote the harmonious development of all of the community , we must say that the goal of eliminate disparity be still a long way from be fulfill , or rather in some case , as with Italy 's Objective 1 zone , paradoxically , disparity be be exacerbate , particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedure and the persistent muddle of procedure ; despite the change to the rule , the Community structure have not yet be streamlined . </s>
in the first place , if administrative procedure be not simplify , it will be hard to attain Community objective on reform , with a view to great efficiency and concentration . </s>
in this respect , the Commission document have shortcoming , as it make no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedure and national legislation for the presentation and examination of project by the national authority , and for their funding , execution and monitoring . </s>
SMEs , micro-enterprises and craft business in particular be still &quot; weak operator &quot; , give that it be precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraint impose by some Member States , include Italy , be major obstacle to access structural fund . </s>
a considerable stumbling block be the fact that the region and other operator find it impossible and be incapable of make plan in time . </s>
in view of this , in accordance with the decision on the @card@ / @card@ guideline ( Howitts report ) , the Commission should have consult Parliament in time . </s>
in fact , it find a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States , and it publish the guideline back in July @card@ , even before the new Parliament have take up its legislative duty , thereby prevent Parliament itself from have any influence on the current content of the guideline . </s>
this be why the mid-term review , provide for under Article @card@ of Regulation @card@ / @card@ , will be of considerable importance . </s>
in general , the current guideline can be consider as clear or transparent . </s>
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assess the progress make in relation to verifiable objective which be completely consonant with the strategy follow in Community policy , and they do not pay enough attention to the implication of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provision or clarification as regard either regional and national authority , or candidate country . </s>
that say , the differ approach adopt in the guideline , which be not gear to geographical objective , but rather to policy area , can be consider as positive . </s>
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of intervention , we can help wonder whether the current situation of the objective 1 zone allow , in practice , a policy of integrated intervention , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriation be necessary . </s>
we could then , theoretically , also support the Commission 's call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , with the task of coordinate the implementation and administration of structural assistance there , provide that this unit do not become a centralise instrument at supranational level , but guarantee real help for those zone - and I stress this once again - which , owe to a whole string of converge negative factor , have not yet harness structural fund to sufficient level , with the result that replace the geographical objective with policy area could , in fact , amount to a negative intervention . </s>
the guideline , as adopt by the Commission , be very limit because , instead of meet the aim of provide guidance , they be provide a shopping list of possible measure , a shopping list which , as it fail to set priority in ascend order , could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guide them towards a series of proposal that be at odd with the desire concentration . </s>
we could say that , in this state of affair , we have once again miss the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increase urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside . </s>
There have be no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could prove to be extremely useful in redress the balance between urban and rural zone and , moreover , would accord proper status to local body which , be independent , could bring about the condition for territorial development more quickly , and make a practical contribution to the effort to reform the structural fund and to achieve the objective of efficiency , concentration and administrative reform . </s>
rural area must truly be see as a resource which should be increasingly invest in , by encourage young people to remain in rural area in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration . </s>
it be now a fact that in order to attain this goal , rural area need to see the creation of new job , which be no longer solely connect with agriculture , in the traditional sense - although this sector be important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also , for instance , in rural tourism , sport and cultural activity , environmental project , SMEs , service , and so on . </s>
a genuine flaw in the guideline be specific guideline for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy . </s>
the fact that this coordination be be put into effect for the first time during the @card@ programme period imply that the Member States really do need &quot; guideline &quot; . </s>
I must also stress that once again the commission be , in fact , skirt the issue of practical action on equal opportunity . </s>
in conclusion , the document be not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspect be disappointing . </s>
Berend Report ( A5-0107 / @card@ ) . </s>
( PT ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thought put forward by the rapporteur concern the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union . </s>
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlight a few issue . </s>
firstly , and as the Commission itself state , it must be understand that the great improvement see by some of the poor region in their per capita GDP between @card@ and @card@ be largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculate the Community average from @card@ onwards . </s>
this obviously cause a slight reduction in the Union 's per capita GDP level . </s>
we also feel that it be particularly important to state that the recovery see in some region - where it do actually take place - be accompany only to a limited extent by growth in employment . </s>
this consequently impose the need for new development strategy , with a considerably great level of attention need to be pay to this area . </s>
this situation show that it would be a mistake to leave adopt measure for promote employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which be what the report propose . </s>
finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur 's proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issue , an analysis of the way cohesion be develop between the region within each State . </s>
the huge variety of situation and the vary development see from region to region within the same State mean that there be a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue . </s>
this kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee correction to regional ( and other ) policy with a view also to guarantee internal cohesion within each Member State . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the Berend report give us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the region of the European Union . </s>
Nonetheless , the French member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feel it can approve some of the statement make therein . </s>
paragraph @card@ , for example , &quot; draw attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union &quot; . </s>
at a time when , in order to fulfil the convergence criterion , Member States be force to undergo a strict budgetary slim regime , one that would be perfectly justified if they undertake it of their own initiative , the federalist be display an astonishing pecuniary gluttony . </s>
as an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU , the lack of result be put down to the lack of money , with everyone compete in eloquence to demand more and more appropriation without anyone ask question about the effectiveness of the money spend . </s>
What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involve set objective for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and try at all cost to find project in order to spend the approve appropriation , rather than allocate the appropriation to existing project ? </s>
expenditure become an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme . </s>
the statistic publish by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show , as Mr Berend point out , the limitation of the policy be implement : the relative weight of the most wealthy region of the European Union be strengthen between @card@ et @card@ , testify to a concentration of wealth , job and activity in certain area : Hamburg , Brussels , Antwerp , Luxembourg , the Paris region , Darmstadt , Oberbayern , Bremen , Vienna , Karlsruhe and Emilia-Romagna . </s>
Quite the opposite of what the rapporteur state , the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate the exodus of population from the most outlying , the most rural and the least populated region in favour of the central axe of the Union ( the Benelux country , North West Germany , Northern Italy , the Parisian region , etc ) . </s>
the poor region be gradually make good their underdevelopment . </s>
in @card@ , the average of the @card@ poor region amount to @card@ % of the overall Community GNP . </s>
in @card@ it be @card@ % . </s>
progress be particularly mark in Portugal and Ireland . </s>
in fact , if the rich be ever more wealthy and the extremely poor be less poor , then it seem that the middle-range region , cover by Objective 2 , be experience an occasionally significant downturn in their GNP , and a worsening of the employment situation . </s>
this phenomenon be particularly mark in France : the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region , which it be my honour to represent , have go from @card@ % to @card@ % of the Community average , that of the Loire region have drop from @card@ % to @card@ % , and that of the Auvergne from @card@ % to @card@ % . </s>
this be a generalise tendency , spare neither the Rhône-Alpes , nor Alsace . </s>
it have be confirm in Sweden and Finland , country where unemployment have in fact increase to a worrying degree over the last few year , as in many region of the United Kingdom . </s>
it may therefore seem strange that , when the structural fund be reform , Objective 2 , dedicate to industrial and rural area undergo economic restructuring , should have be sacrifice in favour of Objectives 1 and 3 . </s>
for the period @card@ , the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU @card@ billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period @card@ . </s>
the rural region eligible under Objective 5b will be include among the main victim of this situation : in France , @card@ % of the population eligible for structural fund be go to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period , a figure which be occasionally much large in some region such as the Loire region , Alsace or Lower Normandy , political stronghold of the right-wing that be the victim of the petty political vote chase of the left-wing coalition government . </s>
base as it be on such choice , it be to be doubt whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union . </s>
von Wogau Report ( A5-0069 / @card@ ) . </s>
( FR ) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union 's declare ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment , the analysis of merger carry out by the Commission should take element other than competition into consideration . </s>
as an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power . </s>
a sizeable delegation of employee of this firm from throughout Europe be visit Strasbourg today . </s>
the management of ABB Alsthom Power , follow a merger carry out in June @card@ , announce restructure where there be already the prospect of layoff in a number of country . </s>
this damaging situation for employment raise many question , particularly regard the information give to the European Works Council , in existence since @card@ . </s>
it suggest that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be update and strengthen . </s>
it also require the monitoring of merger take employment , the environment and consumer into consideration . </s>
since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs do not go far enough in this respect , I abstain . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) by propose to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy , the Commission be devolve to national authority and court the responsibility to take decision and deal with abuse of dominant position in relation to company agreement which create market distortion . </s>
issue of merger and state aid however , still remain within the notification system . </s>
the position that have now be adopt aim to create more rapid way of apply competition policy , move towards apply Community law in national court rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aim at have specialise court . </s>
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve high cost for Member States . </s>
on the other hand , as the rapporteur point out , in the name of competition policy , public monopoly be often exchange for private monopoly , with the privatisation of important industry and public company , as have happen in Portugal , with harmful consequence for the country and its worker . </s>
- ( FR ) the Commission 's White Paper on the modernisation of the rule implement Articles @card@ and @card@ of the EC Treaty ( now @card@ and @card@ ) certainly do not propose any &quot; renationalisation &quot; of competition policy , as some member of the European Parliament fear . </s>
but it do , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting option for development of the European Union . </s>
in fact , take note of the congestion of its service due to the prior notification system of state agreement likely to cause distortion in trade , and afraid of see the number of notification increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States , the Commission be propose to do away with the prior notification system of such agreement , and to apply competition rule at Member State level in a more decentralise fashion . </s>
the most remarkable thing , in my view , be the message convey by this proposal : that the Commission be anticipate the consequence of enlargement and realise that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , require reform of the centralise system . </s>
admittedly , this reform be one of increase flexibility rather than dismantle . </s>
indeed , the White Paper envisage that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system . </s>
moreover , the von Wogau report , which the European Parliament have just vote on , support it in so do . </s>
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval cause by enlargement may lead to Community competence be limit and subsidiarity be extend . </s>
it be a quite different Europe which be take shape in the long term . </s>
be this not , indeed , what be so distressing to some socialist member of the European Parliament ? </s>
the German Social Democrats vote against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which be to say , in plain term , attack the standardise superstate . </s>
curiously , a number of employer agree with them , prefer the European &quot; one-stop &quot; system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally . </s>
indeed , this be one advantage of the present system . </s>
but , on the other hand , the wide view must also be take , namely that the initial decentralisation which have be begin today may , in the long term , lead to great freedom to take the requirement of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone . </s>
Rapkay Report ( A5-0078 / @card@ ) the member of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be vote in favour of these report on European competition policy . </s>
competition be a war which have major concern fight each other , which constantly take the form of layoff , factory closure , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity . </s>
we see a further example of this with the planned layoff in Europe propose by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power . </s>
Eighteen million unemployed and @card@ million poor people within the European Union , despite its be one of the wealthy region in the world : these be the result of this competition which the European institution intend to promote . </s>
the Commission 's declare intention to regulate the condition of competition on the European market be ridiculous , for the only law which competition respect be the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weak element . </s>
this be repulsive most of all in social term . </s>
the European Commission 's report be a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institution have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporation who be engage in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victim this cause . </s>
There be nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employee , nothing to prevent the major concern drive part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholder rich still ! </s>
we acknowledge that this report do have one good point - it show that the work class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institution in term of safeguard their living condition , and still less of improve them . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) when he speak about the Commission 's annual report on competition policy , the rapporteur point out that competition policy can be separate from social and environmental policy , as it must contribute to full employment , social and economic cohesion , and to protect the environment and consumer . </s>
nevertheless , when he speak about a few instrument which be crucial to achieve the objective that have be mention , the rapporteur do little more than criticise various aspect of state aid and demand the harmonisation of rule concern the repayment of illegal state aid . </s>
this threaten the right of Member States with a weak and structurally more vulnerable economy to support economic sector which have suffer as a result of liberalisation and international competition . </s>
on the other hand , the rapporteur ignore the main cause of the distortion of the rule on competition , specifically the grow number of merger and their consequence for that distortion . </s>
another cause be the turning of public company into private monopoly , with serious implication for society , specifically for employment and for the cost of public service . </s>
another main cause of distortion to the rule of competition be the abuse of their dominant position by various cartel which maintain unacceptable practice in social and environmental term , include the sack of thousand of worker . </s>
that be why we be vote against this report . </s>
- ( FR ) in voting against this report , we be act as spokesperson for all the man and woman who in Seattle and throughout Europe express their rejection of a world reduce to strict commercial logic . </s>
we be vote against this report on behalf of the development of public service , in memory of the victim of the Paddington rail disaster , kill not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulation . </s>
this report be essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it be not competition that can solve the problem face humanity at this turn of the century . </s>
whether it be a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition be a factor increase regression and insecurity . </s>
do you imagine that the @card@ million unemployed people in Europe be victim of too reticent an application of this competition policy ? </s>
we be convince that the opposite be true , and we do not think that state aid be by definition excessive . </s>
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criterion of efficiency ? </s>
finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increase the role of the WTO ? </s>
only the legal adviser to multinational could demonstrate such stubbornness . </s>
Jonckheer Report ( A5-0087 / @card@ ) I be please to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the Eu , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the Directorate-General for competition will be make information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website . </s>
I be happy with the rapporteur 's treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this . </s>
There be too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure cause distortion in competition . </s>
admittedly , an effective competition policy be a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union . </s>
however , as the rapporteur point out , such aid be occasionally essential and may , in addition to enable the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( Article 6 of the Treaty ) , service of general economic interest ( Article @card@ ) and economic and social cohesion ( Article @card@ ) . </s>
clearly though , it must be monitor , a task which fall to the European Commission . </s>
the aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sector under consideration reach a total of EUR @card@ billion in the period @card@ , include @card@ % allocate to the manufacturing sector . </s>
this aid be considerably less than the previous period , @card@ ( a @card@ % drop in the total amount and a drop from @card@ % to @card@ % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) . </s>
this downturn in aid be chiefly due to the reduction in aid grant to the new German Länder . </s>
like the rapporteur , I deplore the fact that the figure give in the report do not cover all state aid . </s>
the European Commission must make good these omission as soon as possible . </s>
it must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of datum in good time , which be to say in time for the ninth report . </s>
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission publish a register specify the amount of state aid per Member State . </s>
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament have be totally exclude from the Advisory Committee on State Aid . </s>
in order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be oblige to make regular report to us . </s>
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel be particularly dangerous : the matter of aid result in business relocate from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which make no contribution to the share objective of the Eu . </s>
this be why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft business in the beneficiary country . </s>
Langen Report ( A5-0073 / @card@ ) in the important debate on competition this morning , I express my view on Mr Langen 's report on the implementation in @card@ of the sixth Steel Aid Code . </s>
just as the Court of Justice recognise in its order of 3 May @card@ , the iron and steel industry be particularly sensitive to disturbance to its competitive operation . </s>
establish a system of aid to this sector intend to ensure the survival of successful firm be therefore justifiable , even though Article 4 ( c ) , of the ECSC Treaty prohibit any sort of state aid to the steel industry . </s>
this , indeed , be the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code . </s>
at the same time , it be , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition condition or of the market , hence the importance of regulate such aid . </s>
it be therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid grant in the event of plant closure . </s>
in the same way , it be vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid grant to their steel undertaking , as stipulate under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code . </s>
the Commission suggest that Member States submit their report within a time limit of two month follow the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminder . </s>
like the rapporteur , I be please with the Commission report , but I do deplore the fact that the report do not cover every aspect of the aid . </s>
although the Steel Aid Code be express in a very clear way , the Commission have , on a number of occasion , authorise aid for the steel industry even though such aid do not fall within the category set out in the code . </s>
in the interest of equality , there be ground to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wish to authorise type of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment . </s>
finally , we have the problem of the consequence of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty . </s>
the aid system must effectively be continue beyond @card@ . </s>
my feeling in this respect be that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not cover by the code . </s>
for all these reason I vote in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission 's response to our request and demand . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at 3 p. m. ) oil slick off the French coast the next item be the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast . </s>
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission . </s>
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Parliament for offer me the opportunity to hold a debate on the disaster which have occur off the French coast , as a result of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika on @card@ December @card@ , which result in more than @card@ kilometre of coastline be contaminate with spill oil , lead to the death of thousand of bird and other enormously adverse effect from the point of view of the environment and the preservation of our sea and of clean coastline which meet the minimum requirement of a develop society . </s>
in a way , the sinking of the Erika be the antithesis of what we have all be fight for : sustainable development , development which be respectful of the environment . </s>
it be a clear violation of that approach to development and progress , a flagrant example of the way thing should not be do . </s>
I could expand on the specific fact which lead to this accident . </s>
I will not do so . </s>
we all know them , and I simply want to say that the Commission share the indignation , not only of those who live along the French coastline , who be the first to be affect by this disaster , but also all those Europeans - and non-Europeans - who may face similar disaster . </s>
the Commission immediately express its solidarity and have want to contribute to combat the tragic consequence of this event with all the means at its disposal . </s>
but , in my opinion , it be not sufficient simply to combat these consequence . </s>
we should also seek solution and proposal which will give the well possible assurance that event such as this do not recur . </s>
thus , from the environmental point of view , I must say that , in collaboration with , and at the request of , the French authority , immediately after the sinking , Commissioner Wallström , who be in charge of the environment , create an environmental crisis unit . </s>
this unit set up the Community &quot; Marine Pollution &quot; Working Group and offer the French authority the well European expert in the combat of pollution . </s>
the Commission also participate in the deployment of tool for combat pollution in the area of the disaster , coordinate the action of eleven Member States of the Union , who have send more than @card@ kilometre of float barrier to the area . </s>
we believe that this coordination and its result represent a degree of progress and success , demonstrate a genuine sense of European solidarity . </s>
this state of affair be partly the result of work carry out by the Commission over recent year . </s>
this work consist particularly of the creation of a Community system which gather all available information relate to the existing Community resource for combat this type of pollution , the establishment of a Community Working Group and the joint financing of the project to develop and improve the technique for combat pollution within the European Union . </s>
as well as the emergency proposal , it be also necessary , in the long term , to maintain the capacity to confront other similar disaster . </s>
therefore the Commission be delighted that Parliament have favourably receive , at first reading , its draft decision on the establishment of a legal framework which will improve cooperation in combat accidental pollution . </s>
the Commission hope that recent event will speed up the final approval of this text in Parliament and the Council and will therefore allow us to move beyond the current situation . </s>
however , with regard to transport , I would like to say that the sinking of the Erika once again raise the problem of the prevention of marine accident and , more specifically , safety in the transport of pollute product . </s>
in this case , in the field of sea transport . </s>
in this respect , I believe that , firstly , it be essential to highlight the fact that the European Union have not be inactive since the notorious sinking of the Amoco Cadiz in @card@ off the French coast . </s>
nevertheless , perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we need to do more . </s>
over the last six year , some fifteen Community regulation and directive have be adopt . </s>
this legislation be still recent . </s>
the States have now be provide with a legal framework which allow them to tackle the issue of flag of convenience , as well as all of those party who fail to fulfil their safety obligation . </s>
it now fall to the Member States to demonstrate that they have the political will to provide their marine authority with the necessary mean to carry out their task with regard to control and the application of Community regulation , of apply and adequately demand compliance with those Community regulation which have already be approve . </s>
and , of course , the Commission must be certain to ensure that , in the Member States , these regulation be apply in a consistent manner . </s>
with regard to the sinking of the Erika , the result of the preliminary investigation , carry out by the French authority on the cause of the accident , have be communicate to the Commission . </s>
the report demonstrate the lightweight nature - to use a euphemism - of the control which have be apply in this case . </s>
I must say that the Commission , for its part , since @card@ December @card@ , have approach the Italian authority in charge of port inspection , as well as the classification society Rina , which be responsible for the most recent classification of the Erika , with a view to receive explanation regard the way that the Erika have be inspect . </s>
the Commission must ascertain whether the relevant Community directive be correctly apply in this case , both by the Italian authority , as the port state , as well as the company Rina , as the classification society . </s>
these check , Mr President , be essential with regard to perfect the directive in the future and our ability to improve on the action which be be take . </s>
in any event , I would like to inform Parliament that , on the 28th of next month , a special mission from the Commission will go to inspect the company Rina and , in accordance with the conclusion of this mission , we will take any necessary step . </s>
when I say &quot; we will take the necessary step &quot; , I include the possibility of remove Rina from the list of company accredit by the Commission . </s>
the Commission also make a similar request to the maritime authority in Malta - the Erika be fly the Maltese flag - which , I must point out , have so far offer us its full cooperation . </s>
however , without pre-empt the result of these investigation - how the sinking happen , what the real reason be , and how the inspection be carry out , both by Rina and by the Italian port authority - , all indication suggest that the Erika accident raise a series of question which merit close attention and require us , in my opinion , to act with the great urgency . </s>
the Commission be already prepare a communication on safety in sea transport and port safety . </s>
however , these event clearly oblige us to speed up the presentation of this communication and above all to concentrate on the transport of dangerous good and pollutant , especially oil , gas and chemical product . </s>
this document will be accompany by a series of legislative proposal intend to improve maritime safety in Community water . </s>
the Commission intend to adopt them before June of this year , so that the debate on the propose measure may begin , both in this Parliament and in the Council , as from the second six-month period of @card@ , under the French Presidency . </s>
as for the content of this communication , we basically intend to tackle the follow issue : firstly , the tighten up of control on ' high-risk ' ship , whatever flag they may sail under , although the statistic speak for themselves : in port inspection , ship carry the flag of the fifteen Member States of the European Union show around @card@ incidence per @card@ inspection carry out . </s>
the world average be around @card@ incidence in inspection carry out in European port . </s>
in the case of ship fly the Maltese flag - as be the case with the Erika - the figure be @card@ and , in the case of other flag , it be much higher still . </s>
in order to strengthen control , we will amend the exist directive on classification company , the control of ship in port and the frequency of inspection , relate them to the age and flag of the ship . </s>
in the case of car , we all know that , after four year , they have to undergo a technical inspection every year . </s>
however , in the case of ship , this be unfortunately not the case . </s>
we wish to promote these activity - which , furthermore , have be incorporate into the late international agreement make within the Imo ( International Maritime Organisation ) by mean of the Solas ( International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MARPOL ( International Convention for the prevention of pollution from ship ) agreement - and make them mandatory . </s>
secondly , in European port , we should promote the use of oil tanker which respect the environment . </s>
that be to say , the oil tanker which come to our port should become double hull tanker , instead of the single hull one which present a great risk of pollution in the event of accident . </s>
the latter should be subject to measure intend to progressively phase them out more quickly , in the way that be happen in the United States , and we will thereby remove the risk which we be face at the moment : of oil tanker which can dock in American port be divert to European port . </s>
thirdly , the communication will deal with the complex and delicate issue of liability and the payment of compensation in the event of pollution result from a disaster . </s>
the Commission intend to escape the current legal quagmire and present proposal to raise the maximum limit of liability of the party involve and , furthermore , to include new party in the chain of liability , which at present consist almost exclusively of shipowner . </s>
more specifically , we intend to establish a system which will allow us to determine the liability of the owner or forward of the cargo and hold them liable - indeed , it be because there be forwarder who show little concern for the quality of the ship they charter that shipowner choose to register their vessel abroad - as well as increase the insurance premium pay by shipowner in respect of the total sum insure per ship . </s>
finally , the Commission intend to continue in its effort to improve transparency with regard to the quality of the ship sailing in European water . </s>
in this regard , the Commission propose to speed up the implementation of the Equasix system , which must be in place as from May of this year , which be no more and no less than a system for up-to-date information on the situation of the international fleet to which all these ship belong . </s>
this programme be be develop in common agreement with the French authority and will provide up-to-date and comprehensive information about the situation of individual ship , not to mention the composition of the crew , which be also an important factor . </s>
in conclusion , it be not just a matter of the Erika disaster and what have be do up till now , but rather of reach conclusion so that we can prevent the recurrence of this type of disaster . </s>
we must guarantee the effective application of the regulation on maritime safety . </s>
the International Maritime Organisation , as we all know , have the capacity neither for control nor for make mandatory the regulation subscribe to by some state who often forget their commitment and close their eye - to put it mildly - to the obligation they have sign up to in these convention . </s>
secondly , we must continue to try to achieve great competitivity in the European shipping sector , which be a sector capable of very high level of safety , maintain a high level of requirement , but we must also be capable , with regard to flag of convenience , of combat the abuse which occur in relation to these flag . </s>
finally , lady and gentleman , we must combat the irresponsibility of some shipowner , some forwarder , some state , some company and some operator in the field of maritime transport who , through their irresponsibility , endanger our natural environment and may create disaster such as the one which have unfortunately happen recently along the French coastline . </s>
Mr President , I shall be speak on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also as an elect representative for Brittany , and I be therefore directly concern and shock by these event . </s>
together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group , we table a motion for a resolution . </s>
I be please to see that we have today arrive at a compromise motion . </s>
the Erika shipwreck be a truly European issue , firstly because it be disfigure and pollute some of the most beautiful beach in Europe , with extremely serious consequence for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalist , and also because the underlie issue be the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale . </s>
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occur along the American coastline , and why ? </s>
because the Americans manage to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in @card@ to draw up the Oil Pollution Act , which make the party concern aware of their responsibility , as it make it possible to hold the charterer liable , and be more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitor thank to various regulation and , in particular , the existence of the American coastguard . </s>
if , I repeat , we have have regulation of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occur . </s>
this be why we think that the applicable legislation must be review , particularly the @card@ protocol which have exempt the shipowner , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability . </s>
well , if the charterer be exonerate , then of course he be less concern with the inspection which oil company be responsible for . </s>
the regulation must therefore be review , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlight the inadequate feature of current European regulation . </s>
moreover , as you say , monitoring must above all be step up : that of the flag state , that of the classification society . </s>
you tell us that Rina be an Italian classification register recognise by the Commission . </s>
What be the condition for this recognition ? </s>
What guarantee be there of its reliability ? </s>
you be go to commission a fact-finding mission . </s>
we await the outcome with great interest . </s>
inspection by the maritime authority and supervision within European port must also be tighten up . </s>
There be a Paris Memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulate a minimum for inspection , that be , one in four of the vessel put into European port must be inspect by the maritime authority of the country concern . </s>
this obligation be not respect either in France or in many other European country . </s>
why not ? </s>
What conclusion have the Commission already draw or what conclusion be it go to draw ? </s>
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer be responsible for , in this case , the oil company . </s>
if the charterer 's liability entail a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforce to a great extent . </s>
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authority in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguard who supervise the coast of the United States . </s>
firstly , I would like to thank the environment colleague in my group who approach this particular problem jointly with their transport team . </s>
this disaster be both a transport and environmental one and be not confine to one area . </s>
here we be here again in this Parliament discuss yet another maritime disaster . </s>
I could reel off the list of disaster that have afflict this industry in my @card@ year in this Parliament but I only have three minute . </s>
surely it be now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that be know as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil company and tanker owner take on their responsibility by act to stop these ecological and human tragedy repeat themselves year after year . </s>
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the power that be deliver to us a proper port state control that be effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain area of it ? </s>
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry deliver us tanker with segregated tank and double hold ? </s>
How many more seabird be to die before ship company end the practice of clean their tank at sea which , as our resolution point out , cause far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ? </s>
while I recognise that some progress have be make in area like port state control and minimal crew standard , we be still face with what our late colleague Ken Stewart use to call ' ship of shame sail in and out of our European Union water : rust bucket badly crew ' . </s>
we need the Member States to act quickly and decisively . </s>
we need our government to put up the financial resource need to give us effective control and we need them also to stop drag their foot when it come to maritime safety . </s>
the Erika cost no human life but it may have ruin many human livelihood . </s>
just as the Sea Empress , just as the Braer do . </s>
it be absolutely certain that all three leave us with an ecological disaster . </s>
my group 's sympathy go out to the people of Brittany who have see their area despoil by this disaster , just as my group 's sympathy go out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasion . </s>
be it not about time that we stop express sympathy and start issue enforcement notice to get rid of these ship of shame in favour of safe sea or we will be back again , later on this year , discuss a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly go down spew its crude oil all over the sea . </s>
the time for resolution have pass . </s>
What be now need be action . </s>
sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discuss yet another maritime and ecological disaster . </s>
Mr President , every time there be a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again . </s>
in reality we can never stop accident happen at sea , but it be incumbent upon us all to learn the lesson whenever an incident of this kind take place and apply those lesson to reduce risk in future . </s>
the &quot; Erika &quot; incident be serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affect , but it be devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe . </s>
some say that it be the bad accident that have ever befall the bird life of this part of Europe . </s>
the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believe that as many as @card@ bird , perhaps mainly guillemot , may have die . </s>
the picture many of us will have see of oil-soaked bird be put down by veterinary official be both distressing and tragic . </s>
we all want the high standard for ship whatever flag they may be fly . </s>
we need to enforce the regulation and ensure that the &quot; polluter pay &quot; principle be apply so that financial penalty and some incentive be use to put pressure on both ship operator and oil company to ensure that good practice be introduce . </s>
I agree with every word the Commissioner say in her remark , but the question be , how long will it take to ensure that measure be introduce to deal with the problem in the way she propose ? </s>
as a politician she need to remind her official how difficult it would be be she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , be a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measure she have propose today be simply still remain as fine word and she have not have the chance to put them into practice . </s>
the thought of an incident of this kind occur in the near future should concentrate her mind and the mind of her official wonderfully . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I have bring you a small gift . </s>
here be a cake of oil send by someone live on the French island of Noirmoutier who write to me as follow : &quot; with every tide , the beach be cover with heavy fuel oil which have leak out of the Erika . </s>
with every tide , the volunteer , member of the armed force and fireman remove great pancake of this thick , sticky , black tar . </s>
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? </s>
&quot; indeed this disaster involve the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , be unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology be available . </s>
it be all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty year after the Amoco Cadiz disaster , despite our say at the time and many time since , &quot; never again ! </s>
&quot; it be , of course , the responsibility of policy , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport . </s>
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizen that a disaster of this type will never happen again . </s>
but , listen to you , Commissioner , we be somewhat frustrate because anyone already involve in these matter know that in @card@ , I believe , the Commission and Parliament draw up a very interesting text which already contain all the proposal include in the resolution draw up by the transport committee . </s>
indeed , we must say and keep say that the Erika be one disaster too many . </s>
this be why it be essential , as a matter of urgency , for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directive on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulation determine the responsibility of the owner of the cargo . </s>
we should be aware , for example , that Shell and British Petroleum refuse to use the Erika to transport their oil . </s>
why , in these circumstance , be the liability of total as charterer not recognise ? </s>
your proposal must also include make double hull mandatory and enforce observance , at last , of the ban on degas at sea . </s>
a European inspection body must be establish which can monitor the condition of vessel effectively and efficiently . </s>
in addition , it be also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the Imo , as a matter of urgency . </s>
What point be there in issue restrictive directive if , once they be at sea , most vessel do just what they wish ? </s>
finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteer , nature lover and bird lover , who spontaneously and generously be come through to the aid of the oil-covered bird , organise rescue operation with the mean available . </s>
I can testify to this remarkable work . </s>
you be no doubt aware that approximately @card@ @card@ bird be go to die as a result of this oil slick , which be a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale . </s>
in relation to this , you be no doubt also aware how difficult it be nowadays to preserve natural specie as well as natural space . </s>
and , on this subject , Commissioner , you do not mention how the Commission intend to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitat . </s>
once again , there will be no clearly define party responsible . </s>
in the meantime , it be nature that be take the rap , as always . </s>
Mr President , my group ask that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affect by this ecological disaster , affect both in term of their economic activity and in term of their attachment to their natural environment . </s>
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitor ' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque , spokesperson for the oil slick action group &quot; Marée noire &quot; , make up of man and woman from the French department of Morbihan . </s>
Many volunteer from France and other European country have express their solidarity by lend a hand to the victim in the field . </s>
as the European Parliament , we can express our solidarity primarily by take action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the family affect by the oil slick and , at the same time , demand tighten up of the quality criterion , on the European and international scale , of the regulation and standard govern the safety of sea transport , stipulate much more frequent inspection and sanction that be a far great deterrent to offender . </s>
our proposal be particularly concern with the age of oil tanker . </s>
among those inspect and find to be in contravention of regulation last year , @card@ be at least @card@ year old and some be @card@ and more . </s>
this be no longer tolerable . </s>
next , we have flag of convenience . </s>
accord to the International Transport Federation , over @card@ % of the ship wreck in @card@ be sail under flag of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human being at the expense of safety . </s>
this be no longer tolerable . </s>
finally , there be the lack of transparency . </s>
Everything be do to make the line of responsibility , the identity of the owner and real decision-maker as impenetrable as possible . </s>
this be no longer tolerable . </s>
in all these respect we must ensure real , significant change , include set a time limit for the switch to new standard , include the mandatory double hull , on pain of be ban from the port or the territorial water of Member States . </s>
we must also ensure increase strictness both in issue sea-worthiness certificate and in monitor the condition and the maintenance of vessel . </s>
finally we must ensure that all the party responsible for disaster contribute to repair the damage cause . </s>
I be think specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance . </s>
this be an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation . </s>
in so do , it will have prove its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , be await clear , tangible action . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , as a Member for the French Atlantic coast , for Vendée , I should first like to express the disgust of the people who be the victim of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disaster , cause not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which have also just strike us , but by a crime . </s>
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have see a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity . </s>
What the stricken population be wait for now , those who have lose everything , particularly among those who make their living from the sea and from tourism , those people whose business have be compromise for several year to come , be not for the polluter to repair the damage they have cause , but for the gear to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serve to prevent similar crime affect other people in future . </s>
quite clearly , we be now pay the price for our lack of concern . </s>
because our state , with the blessing of the Community , do not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allow meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessel and we can see veritable coffin ship navigate our water under flag of convenience , drift accord to the short-term interest of the multinational . </s>
it be absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterer , untraceable shipowner and lenient certification company . </s>
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion . </s>
obviously , such matter should be handle at world level , but the current international regulation of the Imo be far from adequate and be far too loose , and neither our own country nor the Community have try determinedly to make them strict , despite previous disaster . </s>
admittedly , there be the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund , IOPCF , but it water down the issue of liability and set its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be review . </s>
the question of flag of convenience must be review within the Imo . </s>
it be up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiative to achieve this . </s>
let me remind you that the Erika be sail under a flag of convenience , that of a state apply for membership of the European Union . </s>
in addition , there be community directive , but they be seldom apply , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspector . </s>
this omission must be remedy as a matter of urgency . </s>
a directive on maritime safety have be in preparation for many year , but it be make very slow progress . </s>
the Commission be display intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcoming . </s>
the date when the Commission be suppose to present its communication devote to this key issue be put off time and again . </s>
it be now schedule for July . </s>
this must be bring forward . </s>
the term of the regulation to be enforce must be particularly clear and strict . </s>
I shall mention three issue that our group feel be priority . </s>
firstly , the liability of owner of oil cargo must be clearly establish and the victim of pollution incident must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally . </s>
the good form of prevention we can offer for the future be the sure knowledge we can offer charterer that they will be heavily penalise in civil , criminal and financial term if they be not extremely vigilant regard the matter of the safety of the vessel they select . </s>
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community water must be enforce as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely . </s>
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessel to be give access to Community water must be establish in the near future . </s>
this could be of a maximum of @card@ year of age . </s>
if we do not obtain a framework of Community regulation which be sufficiently clear , strict and trenchant , then those Member state that wish to do so must be allow to take the necessary step to protect their people and their territory , in the same way that the United States succeed in learn the lesson of the Exxon Valdez disaster by make double hull compulsory and ban all vessel more than @card@ year old from their water . </s>
thus , the Erika be refuse access to American water . </s>
if the European Community have do the same , a great disaster would have be avoid . </s>
let us ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the medium hype and the shock of this House have die down . </s>
Mr President , Torrey Canyon , Olympic Bravery , Haven , Amoco Cadiz , Gino , Tanio , so many name we remember with horror . </s>
and now the Erika . </s>
whose turn be next ? </s>
Twenty one year after Amoco Cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since @card@ , show the irresponsibility of our successive ruler . </s>
the Atlantic West Coast once again be pay a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinational . </s>
it be hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept , and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , have choose to overlook the matter of maritime safety . </s>
and this be the result . </s>
the Erika , a vessel fly a Maltese flag , a floating rust bucket , class amongst the most dangerous type of oil tanker , have contaminate more than @card@ km of our coastline , a case of pollution even bad than that cause by the Amoco Cadiz . </s>
as an elect representative for the Loire-Atlantique region , unfortunately , I can testify to this . </s>
There be nothing natural about these recur disaster , they be the result of fate . </s>
they be the result of human thoughtlessness . </s>
What we have here be an ecological disaster . </s>
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass root could have any doubt about that . </s>
it be also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fisherman , oyster farmer , shellfish farmer , people who make a living from the salt marsh , shopkeeper , etc . </s>
the Erika disaster must be the last in the series . </s>
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck . </s>
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get member of Parliament involve in the team of expert which have just be announce by the Commission ? </s>
next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regard identification of the exact characteristic of good transport . </s>
in fact , accord to the expert , the oil the Erika be carry be suppose to sink to the bottom and should never have reach the coast . </s>
we know what actually happen . </s>
next , reliable technical inspection must be establish like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicle more than five year old . </s>
we must regulate the use of flag of convenience , make double hull mandatory for the transport of pollute or dangerous material , work on technological innovation in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbon at sea . </s>
this would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium . </s>
Non-compliant vessel must be deny access to European water , the responsibility of polluter , shipowner or charterer must be determine in line with the principle of the &quot; polluter pay &quot; , maritime supervision must be strengthen to prevent any degas , thorough and reliable inspection of tanker must be require , an appropriate &quot; natural disaster &quot; budget line must be re-establish for Member States and , in the meantime , Community aid release on an exceptional basis and the French department affect by the disaster should be make eligible for structural fund . </s>
I have also table a resolution on this subject on behalf of the Edd Group . </s>
Mr President , in the course of the last few year there have be a succession of serious tanker disaster world-wide and the countermeasure take have either be ineffective or not worth mention . </s>
it be particularly bad this time , not least because it have affect a major European state ; an incident which could happen again at any time . </s>
we urgently require a directive if we be to reduce these risk . </s>
the @card@ clearly do not suffice . </s>
these guarantee - make no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 thing . </s>
no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again . </s>
All those involve , include the transport agent , be responsible for any ensue damage , and these individual be to provide satisfactory assurance . </s>
this be the only way of afford the victim the opportunity to make their claim for compensation . </s>
however , we must aim high in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that . </s>
in other word , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system . </s>
Mr President , may I start by say that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response . </s>
Many thank for this . </s>
this also mean that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she send on @card@ January but also for the action point which she announce today . </s>
the Erika disaster show that when sound traffic and transport regulation be lack at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second-best . </s>
the damage suffer , also in ecological term , can be express in money . </s>
hence also this joint debate involve transport and environmental management member . </s>
during the Christmas break , when the Dutch medium receive attention for the Erika disaster , I have a look , just out of interest , on the Internet to see what arrangement be , in fact , already in place for the purpose of take relevant measure , especially after Premier Jospin have say that Europe should do more . </s>
What I learn be that , actually , there be sufficient legislation in place but the problem be the lack of supervision . </s>
Could I highlight a few point which have also be touch upon by the Commissioner ? </s>
first of all , the port-state control , accord to which @card@ % of all ship require inspection . </s>
I think that this @card@ % should not only be enforce but that it should also be ensure that more inspection take place . </s>
so this @card@ % should be increase . </s>
furthermore , if a ship be no longer seaworthy , not only should the fact be examine , but a legal system should be introduce which state or recommend that the vessel should no longer be use . </s>
but this be not in place . </s>
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area . </s>
finally , as far as the technical requirement for ship be concern , some member have already mention just now that , since @card@ in the United States , ship should in any case be double-hulled . </s>
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Marpol Treaty , which come into effect in @card@ , should be look at very closely . </s>
Mr President , I would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiation with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many NGOs that have at least roll up their sleeve in order to save animal . </s>
Mr President , we have already have this discussion so many time in the past . </s>
we have achieve nothing so far , and we have be unable to reach agreement within the European Union . </s>
that be why I will only believe that there be any point to have this debate today if what we be all say today , and what the Commissioner have announce here , actually lead to legislation be produce ; in other word , if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers : &quot; you must push this through in the Council of Ministers &quot; . </s>
allow me to say first that what we be talk about be an environmental catastrophe , which also impact on the economy and threaten livelihood . </s>
so what be we to do now ? </s>
I have no intention of talk about past event ; rather I want to look to the future . </s>
What be we to do now ? </s>
I will tell you a few thing we should do . </s>
of course , we need double-hulled vessel . </s>
that go without say , but it be something that will only work through in the medium and long term . </s>
so what do we need to happen immediately ? </s>
we need technical testing of ship , that be obligatory technical testing every two year , and no ship to be operate without the accompanying certificate . </s>
we need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a TÜV , an organisation that undertake technical testing of motor vehicle in Germany , which be compulsory every two year . </s>
if you do not have a certificate then you be not allow to operate the vehicle . </s>
this be what we need for ship . </s>
thirdly , we need to carry out check on these safety and insurance certificate in the port , that be in every port of the European Union . </s>
any failure to produce these certificate must lead to the ship be lay up and prohibit from leave the port , regardless of all the port charge . </s>
we must reach agreement here , in all the European Union 's port , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ship drop anchor . </s>
fourthly , we need the shipowner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory USD @card@ million , but to the value of at least USD @card@ million , to be cover per insurance certificate . </s>
we also need the country whose flag the ship fly to bear liability . </s>
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship be fly will accept liability . </s>
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision ! </s>
I can assure you that those country award flag would then take great care to avoid have to accept liability . </s>
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demand will apply to all ship use the port and waterway of the European Union , and incidentally , that include the candidate country . </s>
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future . </s>
environmental standard will be a recur theme . </s>
I would not like to have someone come and say that these requirement will lead to job loss in the port . </s>
the union will have something to say as will industry . </s>
a long memory will serve us well , lady and gentleman . </s>
I be look at all those of you who have not exactly be at the forefront of the environmental movement . </s>
just you go home and say : &quot; we have not concern ourselves with standard to date &quot; . </s>
we need to have a long memory when it come to the demand be make in the port . </s>
we need to have a long memory when we say : &quot; for once we be unite , at last as far as port charge and requirement be concern , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . </s>
&quot; if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be good off in a few year ' time ! </s>
Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt express very many of my own thought . </s>
we have now obtain a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measure . </s>
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster have lead ? </s>
I would compare the situation with an early generation 's introduction of the Plimsoll line , a mark which be introduce to prevent insurance fraud involve inferior vessel . </s>
where be the sense of crisis which generation before us have ? </s>
I consider that what we should adopt be the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speak about , the identification in the form of green mark on tanker which certain harbour in Europe have bring up for discussion . </s>
we must also critically examine the classification society . </s>
I do not think that we can accept their procedure . </s>
we need independent procedure and procedure involve public control . </s>
finally , I want to say that , when my country provide environmental aid to shipowner who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there be unit within the Commission who regard this as prohibit aid to shipyard . </s>
within the Commission , the one hand do not know what the other hand be do . </s>
it be not an acceptable procedure that measure to improve the environment , which be in keep with the Commission 's guideline , can be take because these be consider to constitute prohibit aid to shipyard . </s>
Mr President , we shall vote in favour of the GUE / NGL Group resolution because it denounce Total-Fina 's responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flag of convenience and the use of superannuated vessel should be prohibit , or that double hull should be mandatory for oil tanker . </s>
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage cause by the oil slick . </s>
How can we stop similar disaster occur in future if we do not institute draconian measure against the major oil corporation , and indeed many other who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of make the world uninhabitable ? </s>
How be it possible not to be outrage when a bank refuse to divulge the name of the Erika 's owner on the ground of professional confidentiality , without government react ? </s>
the crux of the problem be that all government , and indeed all the European institution , acknowledge the right of major corporation such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profit whether it be harmful to their employee or to the environment . </s>
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and bank , even though this same confidentiality serve to conceal what be essentially criminal action . </s>
in these circumstance , even the good resolution will remain little more than appeal to principle which be powerless to limit the great corporation ' capacity to cause damage . </s>
Mr President , I be in favour of tighten up the legislation on port state control and on classification society . </s>
however , we must stick to the fact . </s>
the ship Erika have be investigate four time in the course of the last two year . </s>
the answer can lie in the number of investigation but rather in guarantee the rigour with which the control be undertake . </s>
I have hear in the course of the discussion that have take place in the last few week that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the control . </s>
I can accept this . </s>
if the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that @card@ % of ship be to be monitor on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available . </s>
the control must also be carry out in such a way that the inspector do not just go on board and check whether there be any fire extinguisher miss , rather there must be material testing , for this ship obviously break up on account of material fatigue . </s>
this can only be detect if control undertake be more rigorous . </s>
it should be our goal to ensure that port state control be not superficial , but include material testing . </s>
secondly , I also share the Commissioner 's observation and would like to encourage her to continue down this path . </s>
if it should become apparent that one or more classification company have provide report by way of favour then they should be strike off the list of authorise classification company . </s>
that be the only deterrent we have for prevent other classification company from follow suit . </s>
Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TÜV ( organisation for safety testing ) for ship in the form of the classification company . </s>
There be reputable company too . </s>
you will be familiar with some reputable company , our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable company , but we must look carefully at exactly which company do not fulfil requirement , and these must be strike off the list . </s>
finally , we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it want to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accede it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfil our requirement , for the environment be a communal entity and not something that we can divide up ! </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the Erika sink near my home and be still there , with @card@ @card@ tonne in its hold , the fate of which we be wait to discover . </s>
it could have sink anywhere . </s>
it happen to sink there , and Brittany , where I come from , should not apologise for the fact that geography have make it a peninsula , and the result be that it be often force to clear up after shipwreck . </s>
my first thought be for the @card@ Indian sailor , who be save but of whom nothing have be say . </s>
There could have be death in this disaster and safety at sea mean , above all , man 's life . </s>
by now they be far away . </s>
it be a miracle that they be save . </s>
so we be now experience the same thing that happen @card@ year ago with the Amoco Cadiz ; a wreck on the North coast , a wreck on the South coast , a wreck on the West coast . </s>
thing could well continue in the same way . </s>
commissioner , as time be very short , I would like to pick out the seven point which we feel , and you have already mention some of them , be essential to work on : double-hulled vessel in our water as soon as possible and the strict possible state control of port . </s>
in particular , we must ensure that classification society be compel to make their report public , as currently , we do not have access to them . </s>
then , sanction must be harmonise between the @card@ Member States ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the Union . </s>
we must be tough on vessel fly flag of convenience , not because they be necessarily bad boat , but because amongst these boat there be many bad one . </s>
we must improve information on all of the world 's ship , but provision have already be make for this . </s>
we must also target those responsible and take a tough line with them . </s>
with regard to this matter , I would like to know who own the Erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law be one thing , but there be always real shareholder in the background . </s>
where be the Erika 's owner ? </s>
perhaps they be in lovely villa by lovely beach , get a nice tan . </s>
we would like to know their name and their face . </s>
finally , there must be improvement in the training of crew . </s>
in our society there be no such thing as zero-risk , but we must at least ensure the great possible level of safety . </s>
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner . </s>
have spend a lot of time at sea myself I be well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ship and boat essential . </s>
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who be deal with the consequence of the break up and sink of the oil tanker Erika . </s>
this have be an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resource . </s>
it should be note that the oil industry , through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds , regard itself as liable under the @card@ convention and its @card@ Protocol , for over @card@ % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD @card@ million . </s>
this suggest to me that we should also look to the shipowner , to the flag state and the inspection authority to shoulder their share of the responsibility . </s>
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measure and new regulation , let us look carefully at the exist arrangement to be sure that they be be properly implement . </s>
well to heed call to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposal . </s>
in that context I support call to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection . </s>
I support call to ensure that the classification society effectively monitor vessel ' structural condition and be hold accountable for their action . </s>
call for design improvement in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessel , be sensible but take time to be implement throughout the fleet . </s>
they be no substitute for rigorous regular inspection . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank my socialist colleague , mainly in the committee on transport and the environment , who have not forget that this disaster also affect the fishing industry . </s>
because , as well as the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and loss in the tourist industry , the oil slick deal a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resource , and the damaged coast line will take year to recover . </s>
it be no accident , Commissioner , that the affected area be always those European region which be least develop , those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of case , do not have any other resource . </s>
these be the same area , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activity of certain shipowner who empty the bilge of their vessel off their coast , without any control whatsoever . </s>
I come from a region , Galicia , which have suffer similar accident in the past . </s>
Brittany and Galicia , two European ' Lands Ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulation and transport crude oil in vessel which in themselves constitute potential oil slick . </s>
I therefore believe that it be necessary to act in two way . </s>
on the one hand , by ask the Commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measure to compensate for the effect of this catastrophe on the industry in the area affect , and also by ask them to demand , of international body and of themselves , tight control on ship which sail under flag of convenience . </s>
in this regard , the current process of negotiation on Malta 's accession to the European Union must be use to ensure that this country rigorously monitor the oil tanker which sail under its flag . </s>
on the other hand , prevention be essential . </s>
Portugal be a country which have clearly demonstrate its sensitivity to issue relate to the sea . </s>
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implement a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accident at European level , use all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happen again in the future . </s>
lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carry out by the volunteer and local authority , who remind me of old time when , as the then mayoress , I live through similar situation . </s>
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lack in resource , have battle courageously against the grave effect that this disaster have have on coastal region , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stock . </s>
Mr President , as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like to congratulate the Commission , and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which have really shake the whole of Europe . </s>
we , as the Committee on Transport , be prepare to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we be likewise prepare to discuss , at a late date , the legal implication of this communication . </s>
in addition , I should like to make a number of comment : first , the Commission be right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of Rina , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law be apply . </s>
that should be the start point for our effort . </s>
secondly , apart from the shipowner ' liability , it would be a good idea in such case to examine the liability of the charterer , for example the oil company which be also responsible for cause ecological disaster like this and , of course , for restore the damage . </s>
once we have do that , our reaction to the ecological disaster be fully justify . </s>
however , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which be an important sector of the economy , cover as it do 1 / 3 of transport requirement , which be why our reaction need to be measure : strict , but correct . </s>
I have no objection to examine an amendment make Community law strict but , as other member have stress , we need to start with application , because there be already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact . </s>
this legal framework be fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what be happen at worldwide level and the Member States , under the supervision of the Commission , should endeavour to ensure that Community law be actually apply . </s>
Mr President , one can only welcome the Commissioner 's factual and rational observation , for unlike other , she do not fall prey to collective hypocrisy . </s>
the Erika catastrophe come as no surprise . </s>
I do not know precisely how many , but any number of ship which be practically float time bomb in European water , sail every day , and as far as I can see , a catastrophe of this kind could happen again any day . </s>
we have be aware of this here in this Parliament for over ten year now - there be the Commission 's communication and the report by Mr Ken Stewart , which make mention even at that stage of all the area in which legislation need to be pass . </s>
it all revolve around the ship , the technology , the equipment ; we be talk about the port , how they be organise and what they have to say for themselves , and , of course , it be all about teamwork . </s>
we know full well where the opposition to every single , solitary legislative measure have come from in the course of the last few year . </s>
it always come from the Member States , from the Council of Ministers , where they fight doggedly over every trifling matter , achieve very little in term of progress . </s>
if we expect car-owning citizen to have a clean bill of health themselves and to fulfil the legal , personal requirement and also have their car regularly inspect , then it ought to be possible for the same to apply to ship . </s>
Control be the key word here . </s>
be it really pure coincidence that , to a lesser or great extent , it be always the same state that allow these ship to fly under their flag ? </s>
so why be there no black list ? </s>
if there be dangerous death traps in European water , then why do we not say , as be the case elsewhere , that these should not be allow to enter European water and call at European port ? </s>
therefore , what I would really like to see in your catalogue of measure for the summer be overall inspection for all tanker currently sail in European water , and I would also like an update on what the Member States have actually subscribe to and indeed implement so far , in the way of Imo regulation and convention , for there be still some drag of foot there . </s>
What happen to Erika can be put down to sloppy work , but , as far as I be concern , to collective , criminal responsibility , and we in Parliament will have the opportunity in the course of the next few month , to demonstrate in the case of one matter in particular , whether we be take this seriously . </s>
I be refer to port reception installation , a matter for the Member States . </s>
this will come up for discussion again , and when it do , I hope that we will all still hold the same opinion as we do today . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the unfortunate incident involve the Erika should in fact , as other have say this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where , since @card@ , there have be seventeen accident involve large oil tanker ; more than one every two year . </s>
the economic and social damage , which we have speak about today , in term of the loss of job and fishing and tourist resource , be so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institution . </s>
commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measure which be be adopt and implement . </s>
I trust that these measure will , in a few month , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st century pirate , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea . </s>
I would like to comment on one of the measure to be take , which be mention by the Commissioner and some of my colleague . </s>
I be refer to the double hull , which consist of two layer of steel , with container divide into two tank . </s>
commissioner , there be many expert who consider that the double hull be not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called ' ecological hull ' in which case , in the event of an accident , the seawater penetrate the container and , as a result of pressure , the oil be transfer to other tank . </s>
commissioner , I believe that it be time to opt for the safe technically possible measure . </s>
it be therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other country . </s>
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard . </s>
any cost-benefit analysis which truly take into account all the harm occasion to person and the environment by these accident , be bind to support this approach . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that have be adopt and which will lead us , after each of our respective political group have rally together and express its feeling , finally to produce a joint resolution . </s>
I think that give the dramatic circumstance , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several vote . </s>
on the other hand , Parliament be issue a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speaker who have precede me . </s>
I think that this be an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubt or evasion of a few government and I think that we be provide the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area . </s>
I think that it be quite obvious , and this be the first conclusion that can be draw from the Erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport . </s>
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area . </s>
I therefore believe that this be a project which must be open up with the absolute will to see it follow through and follow through in concrete term . </s>
the Commissioner have suggest three main chapter which need to be draft and bring into line with our legislation , in which we can set standard . </s>
I have also note , to my great satisfaction , that even the group advocate great national sovereignty , or the eurosceptic group be call for Europe to regulate , and I think that this be in fact the right level to take action . </s>
we sometimes regulate thing which could , by and large , remain subsidiary . </s>
in this area we must respond to public opinion . </s>
this be extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we be , when all be say and do , on the global scale merely a peninsula . </s>
therefore , once our legislation have be bring into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law . </s>
we must also put in place systematic control and finally apply the ' polluter pay ' principle of responsibility which be , of course , suppose to be a deterrent . </s>
I have almost finish and I would like to say that I have personally request a public hearing of the Committee on Transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future consideration . </s>
I hope that all political group will support us in our request for a public hearing . </s>
Mr President , the oil tanker Erika , the ownership of which be veil by accommodation address on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which be hire by Total-Fina for the transport of oil , founder off the Breton coastline , with disastrous consequence . </s>
the implication for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment be enormous . </s>
the cause of the disaster must be seek in the weakened structure of the oil tanker . </s>
so people be doubtful about the safety of ship which carry dangerous or pollute good . </s>
the International Maritime Organisation have issue international rule in this connection . </s>
state can carry out port inspection . </s>
in Europe , legislation be strict and it be compulsory to inspect @card@ % of the incoming vessel accord to the port-state control directive . </s>
however , it seem that none of the Member States meet this figure due to a lack of inspector . </s>
it be clear that there be no lack of legislation . </s>
in my opinion , the Commissioner be quite right . </s>
where the scheme falter be in the enforcement of exist legislation . </s>
but how be we now go to enforce this if there be indeed a lack of inspector , esteem European Commission ? </s>
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive @card@ / @card@ concern minimum requirement for vessel bind for or leave Community port and carry dangerous or pollute good will be implement correctly in all Member States ? </s>
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitor ? </s>
Would it not be beneficial , in the short term , follow the Rotterdam model , to inspect accord to a point system in which , for example , account be take of the ship 's age , whether it be single or double-hulled or whether it sail under a flag of convenience . </s>
in short , to give priority to old sub-standard ship over ship which meet all quality requirement . </s>
the Erika be build at a Japanese shipyard and be single-hulled . </s>
There be four more sister ship in service at present . </s>
construction of this type of ship be halt at the time because the risk of rust be especially high . </s>
some of them also sail under the Maltese flag . </s>
be we wait for the next accident to happen ? </s>
Would sanction not be appropriate , as the Commissioner state , for the classification society ? </s>
Rina be currently the talk of the town . </s>
Malta be enter the accession negotiation . </s>
in my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it be guarantee that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future . </s>
I would be grateful if you could be discipline since we be run out of time , and this delay be go to limit the time available for question to the Commission . </s>
Mr President , just before I go down into the Chamber , I receive an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who have choose to spend New Year 's Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of stay at home and celebrate with her relative . </s>
like many other hundred of volunteer , she have see the destruction , wash bird and clean up after the people responsible who be not to be find on the coast on those evening and night when they really should have be require to be there . </s>
like so many other , I too wonder where the people responsible be . </s>
where be the shipowner and those who order the shipment when these disaster occur ? </s>
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establish a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime . </s>
this be not the first time we have see oil slick , whether intentional or unintentional . </s>
( the President cut the speaker off ) I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleague for bring this motion before Parliament . </s>
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of @card@ @card@ tonne of oil have be widely report in the British medium . </s>
although Britain and France have have their difference recently , I can assure you that there be considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected . </s>
TV picture of the damage do to your coastline and wildlife , in particular bird and the already dwindle fish stock , have bring back memory of similar British disaster , such as the Torrey Canyon in @card@ , and have prompt many British volunteer to help . </s>
I salute these joint effort to repair the damage . </s>
this be clearly a problem for all Eu coastline which will require imaginative solution . </s>
instead of allow the cost of these disaster to fall on the community most affect and insurance market such as Lloyds of London , we must develop new technology to retrieve from the sea much more than @card@ % of the lose oil . </s>
There be currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market pick up the tab . </s>
ultimately , the polluter must pay . </s>
in addition we must build on the Council directive deal with enforcement of international standard for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensure that the inspection goal of @card@ % of ship call at Eu port be meet and that a high standard of inspection be deliver . </s>
moreover , although I be not oppose to shipowner register their vessel in their country of choice , I believe there be a need for strict application of international regulation . </s>
rather than ban flag of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the @card@ Eu directive on port state control , national maritime authority must impose more effective sanction on flag state which fail to carry out their international treaty obligation . </s>
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these option , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament . </s>
Mr President , it feel quite strange to be stand here again today , as I have be do at regular interval for almost ten year , and all because of an accident cause by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force majeure . </s>
the victim be wait outside . </s>
they want answer . </s>
they do not want any more promise that we then fail to keep , or to see any effort that we then fail to follow through . </s>
the citizen be right to ask : &quot; do our region now count amongst those which be lose forever ? </s>
&quot; who will provide us with new job ? </s>
when will those responsible at last understand that spare resource be not something we do for fun ; nor be it just a question of create a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it be a joint European challenge . </s>
that be why I welcome Mrs Palacio 's action plan with open arm . </s>
it be equally important to note that &quot; prevention be good than cure &quot; . </s>
but there be an art to that as well . </s>
deploy the German multipurpose ship &quot; Neuwerk &quot; - it be right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entail the swift provision of European neighbourly help . </s>
we be particularly in the debt of those who undertake the difficult deployment of all their crew . </s>
valuable experience be gain , and also the knowledge that we can master such environmental disaster use state-of-the-art technology alone . </s>
we be therefore right to demand improve control , sanction and preventive measure . </s>
I have be fight for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten year , here in Parliament . </s>
the issue be as topical as it be before . </s>
furthermore , I will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvement and logical solution within the framework of European and international cooperation . </s>
Mr President , firstly I would like to express my very sincere thank , not only for the initiative of the different group , of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats , but also for the initiative of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left / Nordic Green Left , who propose this debate , which have lead to a positive and important discussion . </s>
before the end of March , I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative text , that be to say , amendment of specific directive so that discussion may begin in the Council and in Parliament . </s>
I would like to tell you that , in fact , it be not just an environmental problem - it be a very important environmental problem - but it be also a very important social problem . </s>
There be man and woman who depend on fishing , gather shellfish and the service or tourist industry in these coastal area . </s>
they be environmentally sensitive area , but they be also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium . </s>
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation . </s>
Mrs Roth-Behrendt say that nothing have ever be do . </s>
in fact , I believe that thing have be do by the Commission , but there be still more to do . </s>
this be demonstrate by the Americans who , after the Exxon Valdez disaster , within one year , adopt enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threaten , as I say earlier , to divert ship unacceptable to American port towards Europe . </s>
in Europe , after the Amoco Cadiz , or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast , in @card@ , or the Torrey Canyon , in the same year , or the many other case there have be , we really begin to legislate after @card@ and @card@ , particularly in the last few year . </s>
during these year , the emphasis have mainly be on the safety of passenger transport . </s>
that be the reality . </s>
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problem , also derive from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous good in the maritime sector . </s>
I have refer to a series of issue which I will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the actual initiative in the come month . </s>
my intention be - and I insist - for us to begin discussion after the end of March , also coincide with the Council of Ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency , for us to have text to discuss . </s>
flag of convenience be one problem , but be not the only one . </s>
the Romanian flag be not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country have an extremely high number of incidence at inspection ; more than the country with flag of convenience . </s>
Malta and Cyprus have ask to join the Community . </s>
we must be demand on this issue and we be negotiate to this end . </s>
this will oblige us to reconsider the register in the European Union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register . </s>
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the register of the European Union country . </s>
as for the inspection , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider be how the current legislation have work , as Mr Hatzidakis have say . </s>
we already have legislation . </s>
accord to the information which the Commission service have give me , this legislation be not adequately apply in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , mean and inspector . </s>
the problem be not that only @card@ % be inspect , but rather how we select , how we find , the ship which constitute the high risk , through the age of the ship and the risk history of the flag . </s>
unfortunately , the @card@ % often consist of flag which be expect to fulfil the requirement : in this way inspection be quick and the work be carry out more easily . </s>
therefore , more than make amendment , we will have to implement measure to control what be already be do , apart from some supplementary requirement with regard to review , especially in relation to the age of the different vessel . </s>
and that be why we have Solas ( the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ) and MARPOL ( the International Convention for the prevention of pollution from ship ) , two convention of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be make mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitor . </s>
with regard to the question of Union inspector , I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justify the idea that these inspection be carry out by the Member States , which do not mean that the Commission do not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately . </s>
lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability . </s>
not only in term of maximum sum insure , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States . </s>
we have set a figure of USD @card@ million ; in the United States they be talk about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for cover claim payment . </s>
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to level in the United States , but that we also have to reconsider the sum insure on vessel and , therefore , the liability of shipowner , and also to hold liable those who charter ship , which be to say the owner of the cargo . </s>
unless we require that the owner of the cargo be hold liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problem . </s>
I will end now . </s>
I will not expand further . </s>
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasion . </s>
but , obviously , as some speaker have say - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant intervention - we can allow a situation where , within one , two or three year , we have to say once again that we have not do what we should have do . </s>
as for me , I can say , after have debate it in the College of Commissioners , that the Commission be prepare to present the necessary legislative measure , amendment and directive to Parliament and the Council , in order to equip ourselves with the great possible level of safety . </s>
the political will of this Parliament be require - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner . </s>
we have take good note of your intention . </s>
I have receive 8 motion for resolution , in accordance with Rule @card@ ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place on Thursday at @card@ p. M. Storms in Europe the next item be the Commission statement on the storm in Europe . </s>
Mr Barnier have the floor on behalf of the Commission . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , you have just be speak about the human , ecological and social consequence of yet another oil slick which have reach French shore . </s>
we be now speak - and personally , I be very happy that we be - about the consequence of an historic storm , a veritable hurricane which affect France , and also the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria in the same period . </s>
when speak about the consequence of such accident or such terrible weather condition , we be not only talk about the damage to the environment and to property , we be also talk - and this be a point I wish to make too - about the consequence of the storm , as well as of the oil slick , for man , woman and family who , as Mrs de Palacio say a moment ago , be seriously traumatise , wound , bruise , demoralise , the weak of which be desperate . </s>
I have see this myself . </s>
I really think that today we be see an expression of European solidarity , a solidarity demonstrate by word of moral support , but which be above all human . </s>
this be the solidarity that I would like to express on behalf of the whole Commission and , particularly , within the Commission , on behalf of my colleague who have not forget their root or their citizenship : Franz Fischler from Austria , Michaele Schreyer and Günther Verheugen from Germany , and Pascal Lamy and myself from France . </s>
this expression of feeling be to complement that already show by the national authority of these country and by the tremendous surge of generosity and kindness that have be show . </s>
and as we be talk about Europe , I would also like to take my hat off to the spontaneity and the willingness of the volunteer from the public electricity and telephone service , to the fireman and the road-workers who come spontaneously from all over Europe to help to re-open road and to restore electricity and telephone . </s>
in some part of France , some family have only have their telephone and electricity work again since yesterday or the day before . </s>
at the request of President Prodi , the Commission have hold its first talk on this whole issue , a discussion during its first meeting of the year and now , as the President ask us to , I would like to tell you the result of our work to provide every response that the Union can muster in term of rebuild those part of our economic , social and cultural heritage that be affect . </s>
this must be do within the limit of the regulation and the budget , have express our human and moral solidarity . </s>
lady and gentleman , the Commission will therefore make use of every instrument it have in order to help the affected Member States in this reconstruction and to provide any possible aid to the people and business affect . </s>
this will be do in order to complement and to top up the support and aid which have already be decide on by the national and regional authority . </s>
as you know , the Commission have several instrument and tool which can provide aid for this rehabilitation and reconstruction effort and we intend to use all of these instrument , with the same desire to help , which Mrs de Palacio express when she speak of the lesson to be learn from the Erika disaster . </s>
as far as the structural policy be concern , I be personally go to look into how we can use the current decision on the new generation of strategy for economic development which will be implement over the next seven year . </s>
I will also look into how the appropriation , which have already be allocate , particularly to region of rural , industrial and urban conversion and to fishing area , that be , all the region cover by Objective 2 , can help this reconstruction . </s>
the Objective 2 zoning be stop by the Commission after consult the various government . </s>
in Germany 's case , the Commission 's decision be take in December and today , the Commission have stop the Objective 2 zoning plan , not only for Luxembourg and Sweden , but also for France and Austria . </s>
in France 's case , where the damage be objectively the most extensive , the total available appropriation for the new Objective 2 be EUR @card@ billion for the period @card@ . </s>
a preliminary study by the Commission service show that on the basis of a financial allocation set up in proportion to the eligible population , @card@ % of people affect by the storm may benefit from aid eligible under Objective 2 . </s>
the @card@ devastated French department could thus receive around EUR @card@ billion over the next seven year . </s>
for Germany and Austria , the corresponding total sum be respectively EUR 3 billion for Germany and EUR @card@ million for Austria . </s>
I would also like to point out that the devastated area which do not feature on this new zoning plan - and unfortunately there be some - which be not cover by Objective 2 , but which be eligible under the previous Objective 2 and Objective 5b zoning , could also have access to appropriation available in the new programming period as provisional support . </s>
I would therefore like to suggest the most straightforward way in which structural appropriation could broadly contribute to the economic rehabilitation of devastated area . </s>
of course , it be not a question of provide emergency aid since , as you know very well , two year ago the meagre appropriation available in the European budget under emergency aid be discontinue . </s>
it be a question of repair and lasting restoration in the context of the programme currently in preparation and this , in my view , be our most important task . </s>
power for programming action and select priority have , as you know , be devolve to each state . </s>
each government will therefore , under the condition that I have just state , have to establish its priority and make choice . </s>
they will probably have new priority , in order to take into account the consequence of this storm or of the oil slick . </s>
it be up to the government of the country concern to distribute Community financial support among the various region eligible for structural fund , and therefore to propose to the Commission plan for action to be carry out at grass root level . </s>
in order to be more specific though , by way of an example , I would like to remind you that all of these programme in devastated area will be able to finance the restoration of our historical and cultural heritage , area of economic activity , and industrial or trading area . </s>
they could also finance the channel necessary for the flow of raw material and industrial product , for port infrastructure - both commercial and leisure port , the infrastructure of airport involve in business travel or tourism , productive industrial investment , aid to business , and historical and cultural heritage for tourism as well as training for employee qualify under the European Social Fund . </s>
the Commission be therefore entirely at the disposal of each of the Member States , in order to adapt , to rearrange this programming to the good effect . </s>
I would like to stress that this also apply to those who suffer the effect of the other storm at the beginning of December in Denmark , the United Kingdom and in Sweden . </s>
I know that Parliament adopt a previous resolution to this effect , on @card@ December last year . </s>
I hope you do not mind if I stress , even though I have already say it twice , that this apply to Greece too , with regard to the consequence of the earthquake which occur at the beginning of September , in accordance with Objective 1 of the Cohesion Fund . </s>
lady and gentleman , my colleague , Franz Fischler , adopt the same approach with regard to rural development . </s>
follow the reform of the common agricultural policy which your Parliament approve last year , measure for rural development can , for the first time , be cofinanced throughout the Union 's rural area by the ' guarantee ' section of the EAGGF . </s>
France will therefore benefit by EUR @card@ million per year , Germany by EUR @card@ million and Austria by EUR @card@ million . </s>
this aid be available for devastated region and be not constrain by the zoning which I be bind to apply under Objective 2 . </s>
of the measure eligible under the EAGGF guarantee section , I would like to mention restore agricultural and forestry production potential which have be damage , reforestation , infrastructure for country road and infrastructure for prevention and protection such as dyke and warning system . </s>
in this context , probably the most special case be that of the timber industry , which have be affect particularly badly by these storm and to which we will be devote all our attention , in both economic and environmental term . </s>
I would like to say that the EAGGF could also allocate a Community cofinancing grant for the storage of wood . </s>
furthermore , in the fishery sector , it be also possible to employ the structural instrument for cofinancing grant . </s>
France would thus have access to EUR @card@ million for the period @card@ . </s>
community aid will thus be able to contribute to compensate fisherman and boat-owners for the temporary cessation of their activity in case of unforeseen event , up to a maximum of two month per year . </s>
it be also conceivable that the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance , FIFG , will be able to provide assistance which could be use for standard investment project . </s>
I be think here of fish-farming equipment , community facility , restructuring , develop fish-farming site , equip fishing harbour , modernise boat , and I have already discuss these matter with Franz Fischler . </s>
finally , follow consultation of course with my colleague , Mario Monti , the Commission would like to underline the fact that State aid earmark for make good the damage cause by natural disaster or other extraordinary event can be consider compatible with the common market . </s>
it would therefore , in these circumstance , be authorise by the Commission . </s>
we can , then , embark on various course of action straight away , for example in the area of energy , within the framework of the Trans-European Energy Networks . </s>
I know that where the transmission of energy be concern , there be many technical problem , particularly in the transmission of very high voltage energy . </s>
nevertheless , look back to my quite recent time as Minister for the Environment in France , when I campaign for underground line , I would like to point out , as one of you do a while ago , that in this area as in many other , prevention be much cheap than a cure . </s>
I therefore hope that the Member States will vote in favour of lay telegraph , telephone and electricity network underground , when this be technically possible , and that they be encourage to do so . </s>
and that , lady and gentleman , cover the Community instrument , which offer many opportunity for very practical intervention . </s>
the European Union do not and will not do everything . </s>
it can nevertheless do a great deal , on condition that we be able to make use of these instrument , that you keep us inform and that Member States be able , in the day follow these storm , to set out their priority and to make choice . </s>
it be therefore very important that this House , as well as the Commission , pass this information and this practical expression of solidarity on to all partner involve and to the people concern and affect . </s>
as far as I be concern , I shall endeavour to do that myself this week , when I visit , the day after tomorrow , two French department which have be particularly badly affect by the storm : Charente-Maritime , affect both by the hurricane and the oil slick , and Creuse . </s>
I shall also present today 's decision on Objective 2 . </s>
tomorrow , @card@ January , my colleague Michaele Schreyer will visit one of Germany 's most devastated region , the Black Forest , in the state of Baden-Württemberg . </s>
with thank for your patience , I should like to conclude this presentation , Mr President , by mention a subject close to my heart . </s>
this be one of the lesson we should learn from these disaster , which do not always have natural cause , but which often do . </s>
we be convince that such disaster reinforce the need for good coordination within the Union of each State 's resource for repair , emergency aid and civil protection . </s>
the Commission already have a unit for the coordination of civil protection , for which my colleague , Margot Wallström , be responsible . </s>
this unit , I might add , work well when it have to deal with the oil slick , to find boat , arrange protection for beach , machine for clean oil-covered bird to the extent that it be possible . </s>
the resource of @card@ European country be employ here , a fact which be sometimes forget , and which justify the tribute I want to pay to the spontaneous solidarity show by all European country . </s>
nevertheless , I think that we must go even further . </s>
President Prodi , Margot Wallström and I be convince that we need to find a more systematic way of develop a European intervention strategy , which be base on exist mechanism in each country , on specialise unit , such as fire brigade , vaccination and civil protection team , mountain rescue dog team and many more . </s>
member of these unit , whilst stay in their own country , would undergo a common course of training . </s>
if need , they could be mobilise , both within the European Union , as we have see with this storm and the earthquake in Greece , and outside the Union , as happen in the case of Turkey and South and Central America , follow the tragic event that have take place there . </s>
this really be an opportunity to create a genuine European civil protection force . </s>
today , we have a long way to go , even if the Helsinki European Council do take a step forward in this direction and Margot Wallström 's service be work on extend the role of the ' search and rescue task force ' . </s>
for the moment , of course , the Commission have neither the manpower nor the financial resource to take responsibility for such a task . </s>
we think , though , that with Margot Wallström and under the authority of President Romano Prodi , this be one of the lesson that we will be learn from this series of disaster , natural or otherwise , which have have such tragic consequence . </s>
in term of efficiency and also of political clarity , this task force would be a symbol of our idea of the European Union . </s>
as far as I be concern , I intend , within the Commission , to promote this idea as one of the lesson to be learn from this disaster . </s>
Mr President , the last day of @card@ be sweep away by an incredibly violent storm , which strike France in the main , but also affect Germany , Spain , Great Britain and Switzerland . </s>
I be sad to say that it account for more than @card@ death , @card@ of which occur in France . </s>
the human cost have be enormous , but so have the material damage , and both public amenity and private property have be destroy or seriously damage . </s>
million of home be without electricity , telephone or run water . </s>
economic activity have be bring to a halt . </s>
in France alone , insurance company be already estimate the cost of the damage at a total of FF @card@ billion , which be between EUR 5 and 6 billion . </s>
this unprecedented natural disaster have call all available force to action and have give rise to demonstration of solidarity both within the Community 's border and beyond . </s>
this be why I would like to thank all of those who give a hand to the emergency service , and to the authority and public service which be overwhelm by the magnitude of the task . </s>
thank you , everyone , from the bottom of my heart , for this invaluable help . </s>
now that the shock have pass and the authority ' vital function have be re-establish , I wonder , and I ask the Commission and the Council to consider as well the opportunity once again to incorporate a budget line for emergency aid into the Community budget , in order to address this kind of occurrence . </s>
the risk of weather-related disaster must not be ignore and , in the light of the consequence of such disaster and the speed of intervention that they require , I think that the Community would do well to have these resource again . </s>
it should be possible to release the emergency aid that we once have from the strict rule apply to the structural fund . </s>
I also agree with Commissioner Barnier 's proposal to gradually set in place a European civil protection force - a proposal he put forward several month ago now - which we discuss , Commissioner , at the time of the earthquake . </s>
it be obvious that the answer to the question I be ask about re-establish Community emergency aid must be &quot; yes &quot; . </s>
next , I would like to address the huge problem encounter by one industry that have be particularly badly affect by this storm . </s>
I be talk about the forestry sector , whose business have be seriously damage by the havoc that the terrible weather wrought on the forest . </s>
it must be understand that forest be not just landscape or environmental feature . </s>
they also represent a major socio-economic sector in some region , and this should not be overlook . </s>
in France , more than @card@ million cubic metre of wood be bring down by the wind . </s>
this represent around three year ' full harvest for producer . </s>
the consequence of this have be immediate . </s>
some forester have lose everything . </s>
entire area of forest have be devastate , which will , in a few week , cause security and fire-fighting problem . </s>
price have already fall because of the huge availability of timber , which have lead to market saturation . </s>
infrastructure will suffer as a result of the abnormal volume of heavy good vehicle , log and handle gear on the road . </s>
in these circumstance , it be crucial that we re-establish access route , restore the land , and implement technical solution , which will enable us to refit storage area , and prop up timber price . </s>
in the long term we will have to reforest , with all the resource we can muster . </s>
this be a whole raft of measure which should be adopt , Mr President , and I be delight at the indication which the Commissioner give , even though he know that not everything be eligible under Objective 2 . </s>
Médoc be not , Commissioner , and I hope that , give the circumstance , the EAGGF will be able to replace Objective 2 . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Parliament must not consider the unusually violent storm which have rage across various European region to be a normal occurrence . </s>
it be certainly a tragic one , but it must be see as something exceptional . </s>
on the contrary , these storm and their consequence be political event of major importance . </s>
How so ? </s>
why be this not an exceptional matter ? </s>
firstly because we now know that the occurrence of this kind of climatic phenomenon be never entirely unpredictable . </s>
we now know that this kind of storm be often relate to phenomenon of climate change and to greenhouse effect phenomenon , with regard to which our citizen be wait for the European Union to develop a comprehensive strategy of study and forecast . </s>
beyond that , though , what be at stake here , and this be why I say that it be , for us , an exceptionally important political phenomenon , be Europe 's ability to be what it claim to be , that be a Europe which be close to its citizen . </s>
this mean , of course , that today we must send out a powerful message of solidarity to everyone affect by the storm and to the family that have lose a love one . </s>
I would like to reiterate that we deplore the death of at least @card@ people during this storm . </s>
this message must go to the craftsman who have lose their work tool , to the farmer who have see year of hard work disappear in a few minute , and to everyone who see in the 21st century in the cold and by candlelight . </s>
with regard to this , I be delight at the work that have be do in recent day in this House between the various political group in order to reach a joint resolution which , I hope , will be adopt tomorrow . </s>
but in specific term , and go beyond fine word , this solidarity must obviously be translate into a major mobilisation of finance which will enable us to set about rebuild the devastated economic sector , the destroy communications network and , quite simply , to provide people with decent living condition once again . </s>
I understand that some of the devastated area be eligible under the Community Structural Funds and that everything possible will be do to mobilise them as quickly as possible . </s>
I would like to say , though , that this be not sufficient . </s>
it be not sufficient because the reallocation of these ongoing appropriation , simply towards make good the damage , penalise long-term project for investment and development already in place . </s>
above all , I think that public opinion will see this solution as unacceptable in term of our political responsibility to Europe . </s>
our fellow citizen do not understand why the European Union be able to release considerable sum of aid in exceptional emergency condition to help third country which have suffer natural disaster , even if this aid be quite legitimate . </s>
from now on , if we want to ensure that Europe be not perceive by our citizen to be a machine churn out complex and pernickety regulation , this be something we must change . </s>
we have to come up with a new budgetary mechanism which will enable us , eventually , to raise sufficient fund in the event of an emergency and in the light of the great logistical and human mobilisation which we see , with specialist come from all over Europe . </s>
we must effectively facilitate the creation of a Europe-wide civil protection body . </s>
it be only when time be hard that we recognise our fellow human being and appreciate their solidarity , and I think that this be the price of build a citizen ' Europe . </s>
commissioner , I would like to thank you for the idea you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposal concern the people affect and who be expect a lot from the European Union , in term of the help that we can offer them . </s>
in the day immediately follow this terrible storm I write to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authority to redraw the boundary of Objective 2 so that all area devastate by the storm in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2 . </s>
I think that you must have do so , because you have not mention it . </s>
in fact , we all know that anyone who do not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid . </s>
we should therefore put this situation right immediately . </s>
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one . </s>
let me explain . </s>
I be in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroy around @card@ % of deciduous forest . </s>
indeed , for some ' forestry ' district , which have lose @card@ % of their tree , this represent a huge loss . </s>
we know , for example , that it take between @card@ and @card@ year for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these town will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five year , but over many more . </s>
the town concern estimate that it will be spread over @card@ year . </s>
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural town through subsidy for loss in their financial revenue . </s>
I think that this be something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policy . </s>
it be true that the problem of the forestry sector be an extremely complex one . </s>
indeed , you speak of release fund for timber storage on the ground that its price must not depreciate . </s>
on the other hand , district which have not be affect by the storm will also suffer , as the National Forestry Office have decide to freeze cut in forestation for four year . </s>
those district which have not suffer loss will therefore see their income decrease in any case . </s>
I be tell you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem be , and I thank the Commission once again for extend their analysis of this situation as far as it could . </s>
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there have indeed be an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophe be still to come . </s>
as you yourself say , Commissioner , these disaster or storm do not always have natural cause , and we think that these be the first sign of climate change . </s>
we should therefore review our policy in order to take account of this fact . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , France be still in shock as a result of this terrible disaster which have cause the death of dozen of people . </s>
no sector have be spare : road , air , rail , port , electricity and telephone infrastructure , home , school building and historic monument , not forget of course agriculture and forestry , which have be devastate in many region . </s>
people may have be traumatise in the area where the damage have be great , but nobody have give up in the face of these terrible circumstance . </s>
in the day immediately follow the storm , a fantastic spirit of solidarity and generosity develop , and still exist . </s>
elected representative , municipal employee , citizen of France and of all Europe have rally round to offer their help . </s>
I would like to pay special tribute to the commitment and the devotion of the public service employee who give freely of their own time with the sole aim of help those affected , to re-establish normality with regard to electricity , transport , telephone and the utility . </s>
at this testing time , demonstrate their efficiency , the public service have remind everybody how essential they be to the life of our society . </s>
I think that this should give us pause , particularly with a view to halt the current process of deregulation and privatisation . </s>
it be , of course , also crucial to tend to wound , to make preparation for reconstruction and repair , while learn all the lesson that this terrible disaster have to teach us . </s>
I clearly hear what Commissioner Barnier be say and indeed I appreciate his proposal , but personally , I would not set emergency goal and long-term goal in opposition to one another . </s>
on the contrary , I think that the situation show in hindsight the relevance of the proposal my group make to restore a specific budget line for natural disaster in the Union . </s>
it would also be appropriate , of course , to increase the structural fund for reconstruction in region which have be devastate , particularly appropriation for rural development , for agro-food measure and for forestry . </s>
I take particular note of the proposal concern Objective 2 . </s>
finally , the idea that this type of disaster be connect to climate change due to the consequence of human activity upon the environment have be advance . </s>
if this idea be to be confirm , the European Union would have to make considerably more effort to ensure that the commitment give at the Kyoto Conference be respect . </s>
it should also make protection of the planet a priority , rather than the unbridled pursuit of profit . </s>
Mr President , everyone who have travel here by car , train or aeroplane , have be able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in France , cause by hurricane of a completely unprecedented violence which strike Europe at the end of last month . </s>
What can the member of the European Parliament do when face with such a widespread disaster ? </s>
firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the mayor and local representative who , on a daily basis , have have to reassure their constituent , organise volunteer and cooperate with the public service . </s>
they have earn the confidence of their fellow-citizens . </s>
next , I would like to thank the emergency service and the armed force of the Union 's Member States who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , come to support the effort of their French colleague . </s>
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid . </s>
if this disaster have take place in Guatemala or Turkey , we could have immediately use the Community budget to help the victim , but in our own country nothing of the kind be possible because there be no suitable budget line with which to do so . </s>
we must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authority and individual state from come to the assistance of business affect by the disaster by apply Community competition rule too strictly . </s>
I be think in particular here of fish and shellfish company , which have be particularly badly hit . </s>
as you say , Commissioner , we must ensure that there be compensation for the force cessation in activity and that appeal can be make to FIFG for investment that have be totally wipe out . </s>
beyond this , I think that implement MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal region that have be affect . </s>
I therefore ask the Commission to stop do so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investment , which they urgently need . </s>
Mr President , the storm which devastate France during the night between @card@ and @card@ December have cause , as have be say , @card@ death and damage to a value of FF @card@ billion , I. E. EUR @card@ billion . </s>
almost three week after the disaster , several thousand people be still without electricity and telephone , @card@ @card@ hectare of forestry land , or @card@ million cubic metre of forest , have be ruin , and our historical heritage have also be affect , as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrate . </s>
it seem quite natural that give such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated region and those people who have be bad affect . </s>
as the previous speaker have say , and as you say , Commissioner , in response to my fellow Member , Mr Martinez , with regard to another tragedy , the flood in November in the Southwest of France , you have certainly note these disaster with concern , but all you be do be point out that the budget line for emergency appropriation for natural disaster have be discontinue , which have result in this shocking paradox . </s>
this paradox , point out by the previous speaker , be that it be easy , a great deal easy , to offer help to victim of natural disaster outside the Union than within it . </s>
we know full well that what you be do , Commissioner , and that be , limit yourself to give us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefit from the structural fund of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b . </s>
these be the term of the written answer you give Mr Martinez on @card@ January @card@ . </s>
I can show you a copy if you wish . </s>
we would understand completely if you be not able to say anything else give the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission , but also of this Parliament , and if you can do anything because there be no legal or financial framework for do so . </s>
but for pity 's sake , and I be not say this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriation which have previously be earmark under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victim of the storm . </s>
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which be allocate to us for natural disaster . </s>
we must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriation and we must change the forestry policy implement in most country in the Union . </s>
that , however , be another problem altogether . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe have undergo a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium . </s>
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolence to the family in mourn as a result of the appalling weather condition that devastate Europe in December . </s>
these storm be an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forest . </s>
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forest in my region , Lorraine , which have suffer enormous destruction . </s>
I would like to congratulate the regional authority , the volunteer and the public service on the fantastic way in which they rally round but , unfortunately , their trouble be not yet over . </s>
it be Europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the effort of the government of Member States affect by the disaster . </s>
I welcome Mr Barnier 's statement and I also welcome the measure which the Commission have announce . </s>
I be certainly not forget the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry have be devastate and a whole population be suffer the tragic effect of this . </s>
the Community action programme for civil protection , establish by a Council decision on 9 December , be launch on 1 January @card@ . </s>
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . </s>
this programme must work at full capacity . </s>
although it may have be effective in certain area - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier 's word - unfortunately it be still in its infancy when it come to forestry . </s>
our priority , as we wait for Community-level fund to be free up , be for material aid in term of partnership exchange between Member States . </s>
it be therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest road , and to repair them as quickly as possible . </s>
lending forestry equipment and make personnel qualify in forestry management available be also cover by this measure . </s>
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problem which could result from have to abandon large amount of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through have to store such large quantity of wood . </s>
finally , it be essential that we slow down the log of stand wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfall . </s>
these timber sale should be support by strong medium coverage in Member States . </s>
this aid for gather timber be , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural area . </s>
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be manage now that the emergency be over . </s>
this be a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this play in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economy . </s>
it be therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity . </s>
if this solidarity be to have be worthwhile , it be up to Europe to propose priority action for safeguard the timber industry . </s>
Hurricane &quot; Lothar &quot; should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertake repair once the damage be do - something which be discuss at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the term of which potential perpetrator be bring to book too . </s>
current programme must be accelerate . </s>
for example , as they stand , the Commission 's programme will preclude us from meet our obligation under Kyoto . </s>
the trade in emission right be immoral to my mind and rather than solve the problem , it shelf it . </s>
the entire taxation system must be give an environmental perspective in the medium term . </s>
we must work more rapidly towards achieve the target stipulate in the White Paper for renewable energy source , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gas . </s>
the new Commission have not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it have put forward be woefully inadequate ! </s>
Commissioner , Mr President , Lothar be a quite ordinary name hitherto . </s>
however , it have now achieve notoriety . </s>
the hurricane of the same name sweep across Europe claim numerous victim , mainly in France and Germany , but also in Switzerland , leave a trail of destruction in its wake . </s>
the wind triumph over electricity pylon , roof , traffic sign and , ultimately over the forest . </s>
we have hear that in a short space of time the storm leave us with approximately @card@ million cubic metre of solid timber , and this be only an estimate . </s>
I have listen to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arm the fact that you be intend to go and see for yourself the effect the catastrophe have have in France and in Germany . </s>
if Mrs Schreyer be to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few day , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual . </s>
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happen not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ? </s>
What answer will the Commission give , when it be on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attraction etc . </s>
? </s>
All this be well-intentioned advice . </s>
however , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominate and I can tell you that we be already feel the effect of the immense damage . </s>
the thinning-out we need be not be attend to ; the forest be not be tend to the requisite degree . </s>
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency be to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue be raise again at a late date . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two fact . </s>
firstly , at the beginning of @card@ , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flatten Kosovo with bomb in the name of freedom . </s>
we be now endeavour , at huge cost , to get the country back on its foot again and help its people , and rightly so . </s>
secondly , at the end of @card@ unbelievable storm rage bring death and destruction to vast tract of the Eu . </s>
the Commission in Brussels respond to the victim ' cry for help with a shrug of shoulder . </s>
&quot; we do not have the wherewithal for that , &quot; they say . </s>
this be wrong ! </s>
and no one can comprehend this attitude . </s>
certainly those who fear for their livelihood be at a complete loss . </s>
the citizen of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community . </s>
I say they have a right to solidarity . </s>
indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hour of need . </s>
I urge the Commission not to keep have to be ask and to provide assistance for the victim of the storm . </s>
it know the in and out of aid provision good than any local organisation or authority . </s>
I call upon you , lady and gentleman , to support me in bring home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels office be lack be not so much the wherewithal for provide aid as the good will . </s>
permit me one further comment . </s>
although it be less evident in the case of the consequence of the storm , the tanker disaster off the French coast have make it very clear that we need to give the Commission a help hand on another matter . </s>
the European Union need rule govern environmental liability as a matter of urgency . </s>
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public have to foot the bill for damage that have often be cause by individual involve in criminal machination . </s>
we must make the perpetrator liable for all manner of damage do to our environment . </s>
then , for example , people will think twice before transport oil in a tanker that be about to fall apart . </s>
when , in @card@ , over five year ago that be , I join the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I become rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier . </s>
To this day I be still await an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work . </s>
it be a scandalous state of affair that must be end with all haste , and I hope that February do not see this dossier be postpone yet again ! </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the storm that take place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into think about certain problem . </s>
it have become clear that mankind continue to be unable to avoid natural disaster . </s>
There have always be natural disaster and there always will be . </s>
of course , there be a need for solidarity here . </s>
There be certainly a need for European civil protection , and the Eu budget must also provide for a budget line cover natural disaster . </s>
but , most importantly , it be only ever man that make the mistake as far as the nature-mankind relationship be concern - despite the fact that the same mistake have often be make down through the century - and never nature , for nature can make mistake . </s>
the extent of the damage cause on this occasion be determine by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monoculture , if we be talk forest . </s>
of course , I be in favour of provide assistance where we can . </s>
but when it come to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be place on lay electricity and telephone cable underground . </s>
we must take account of small cycle and plant stable mixed woodland when undertake reforestation , rather than monoculture . </s>
the most important subject for discussion in this context be the climate . </s>
To this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of have the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still do its stuff . </s>
America and south-east Asia be have a much bad time of it as far as climate and storm go . </s>
we be fortunate in have the Gulf Stream . </s>
but in common with other , we too be have to endure the greenhouse effect . </s>
this be partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it be to demonstrate climate change use calculation . </s>
we must take more account of the guideline produce at the Kyoto environmental conference . </s>
we must reduce CO2 emission , employ renewable energy , and generally make enquiry , in this connection , as to how the forest of Europe be fare . </s>
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victim . </s>
this be an irreparable loss . </s>
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French department and citizen , and the solidarity of other country with France , which be the country bad affect . </s>
as I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two element of our resolution . </s>
I believe that the first one be implicitly recognise by the Commissioner in his speech when he wonder whether these catastrophe be natural or not . </s>
that be to say that expert be ever more convinced that climate change and human activity , in general term , be link to the increase see in natural disaster in recent year . </s>
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature have rise more than in the rest of the century . </s>
therefore Europe must be clearly commit to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposal . </s>
secondly , I be rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner 's proposal to create a European civil protection body . </s>
furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this be an extraordinarily catastrophic situation . </s>
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the family and community that lose member in this terrible tragedy . </s>
it be really the loss of life that make this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standard . </s>
it be regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situation like this . </s>
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and region that have tragedy like this . </s>
that be important . </s>
the other thing we should remember be that we do have a budget line in the past . </s>
it be very small . </s>
it be not able to do very much but it be repeatedly abuse by member of this House propose action when the disaster be not even major . </s>
official and minister from Member States be come to Brussels , whisper with the Commission and get a few euros and make a political point by bring aid back to their constituency . </s>
so there be not much sympathy for this budget line when it be abolish . </s>
I think we should reinstate this budget line . </s>
when we have the earthquake in Greece , which be a big disaster , the Community have no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks . </s>
the same when the flood come in France and the same again now . </s>
these be major disaster , we should have an instrument , we do not have it . </s>
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rule tight so that only in situation where grave disaster occur will we call up this particular instrument . </s>
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happen we have an instrument to deal with it . </s>
we do not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have have many serious wind storm on the Atlantic . </s>
we have flood in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffer from these . </s>
lady and gentleman , none of us must forget what have take place . </s>
it be true that there be a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seek to discontinue emergency line . </s>
it be also true that there be a lot of European money around . </s>
Commissioner Barnier have point out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article @card@ of the regulation concern rural development , forestry would be eligible under Article @card@ , company would be eligible under exemption from the competition law state in Article @card@ ( 2 ) of the Treaty and public facility would be eligible under the structural fund . </s>
it be nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what be allocate before the storm will now be free up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity . </s>
it be nothing more than the States play at take from Peter in order to give to Paul . </s>
this be inadequate , and I be personally delighted that Mr Barnier have state an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , I express when I tell the press in Bordeaux what I be hope for , and that be the establishment of a reinforce policy of European civil security . </s>
if the European citizenship that we all want to see be to come into be , if the mandate that our President , Mrs Fontaine have stake on a close relationship between the Union and Europe 's citizen be to be effective , our citizen must be able to feel that we be act with some urgency . </s>
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force , real civil relief blue helmet , who would go to area in difficulty within the Union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the union if need be , in Venezuela or anywhere else , be something that we should hope to see . </s>
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he have an active ally for this idea which strike me as noble and truly European in spirit . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storm occur in other part of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe get off relatively lightly . </s>
nevertheless , the storm that take place in the last week of December show us what the consequence can be and that there be major problem in store for us . </s>
Anyone travel to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have be able to see for themselves that storm rage in Alsace as well . </s>
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizen in the region where the storm rage so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this Chamber , point to how important it be to support these region and people . </s>
each and every one of us know that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow . </s>
What we need to do now be to deal with the fall timber as swiftly as possible . </s>
for it be common knowledge that we could have an even great disaster on our hand if the fall timber be to be leave in the forest too long . </s>
for instance , it should be point out that fall timber provide the good breeding ground for the bark beetle 's larva , and we be not yet in a position to assess the repercussion this will have . </s>
that be why it be absolutely essential to deal with the fall timber before the warm weather arrive . </s>
decade will have go by before we be able to determine the true extent of the damage sustain by the forestry industry . </s>
for we all know how long it take a tree to grow . </s>
the calculation be in decade rather than year . </s>
in addition , I would like to point out that the forestry industry be certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that act as a shield against avalanche also constitute an important factor in certain region . </s>
I be therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry worker be also prepare ... . </s>
. </s>
( the President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I extend our deep sympathy to all of those who be affect by the storm . </s>
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what be happen in other country . </s>
we have very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sink . </s>
I be ask to highlight the result of the storm in Ireland . </s>
we have high wind and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , add to existing difficulty , result in thousand of acre be submerge , sometimes , in up to @card@ foot of water . </s>
we experience the human misery of flood home and farm , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disaster of E. coli-infected water . </s>
I talk with farmer whose ewe be abort their lamb due to drink the infected water . </s>
natural habitat be destroy . </s>
so I ask that Ireland be remember in this particular case . </s>
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who express their solidarity with the storm victim . </s>
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe . </s>
for the storm will have major implication for the forestry industry in all area of Europe , and I believe we need , in the long-term , to give think to how problem of this kind be to be deal with in future . </s>
we certainly do not want market organisation for forest , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implication for the victim in some way . </s>
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performance of this kind of major disaster in the future . </s>
as have already be mention here , there be indication - no proof , but clear indication - that the increase in storm world-wide have to do with the climate catastrophe . </s>
of course , the scientist do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them be fairly convince that if we continue to emit greenhouse gas as we be do , these storm will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century . </s>
I believe now be the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours , Tom Spencer . </s>
he suggest that rather than give storm the name of man or woman , we should name them after the perpetrator of the greenhouse effect - he propose the oil company at the time . </s>
however , an exception should certainly be make in the case of Shell and BP , for they have change policy and do not just base their sale on fossil fuel which be damage to the climate , rather they also invest in form of energy that have future viability . </s>
we must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make sweeping statement to the effect that the greenhouse effect be to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of be that we have reason to fear further catastrophe if we do not soon alter our course ! </s>
Mr President , I would first like to thank you for propose to extend this debate in order to see it through . </s>
next , I would like to say that as a Commissioner , but also as a French citizen , I have be very touch by the expression of sympathy and solidarity that I have hear from many European member of Parliament from throughout the Union . </s>
we can therefore see , thank to this debate , a picture of the Europe which I believe in , one which be not merely a supermarket , but which be also a place of humanism . </s>
I would like to thank Mrs Scallon , Mr Martin , Mr McCartin , Mrs González Álvarez and Mr Savary who have , in particular , take up or support the idea which I be put forward for a more unite , more operational , more easily understand response , for civil security or civil protection . </s>
this could be achieve by create a European civil security force , and we shall continue to advance this idea , which we shall keep you inform of in the come month . </s>
Many of you ( and I listen closely to Mrs Gebhardt , Mrs Patrie , Mrs Isler Béguin , Mr Souchet , Mr Gollnisch , and Mr Savary ) have say that there be not enough money or rather that there be no extra money . </s>
but , I have be a parliamentarian for a long time , and I shall not tell you your job , as you know how the budget and the general regulation of the Structural Funds work . </s>
you vote for this budget and therefore you understand perfectly well the framework in which I operate . </s>
I be not go to pull the wool over your eye . </s>
I want to discharge my responsibility seriously . </s>
this do not mean that I think it be in fact impossible to reintroduce an emergency aid line in any rigorous way with a very strict specification . </s>
this line only ever consist of a few million euros in any case . </s>
that would not have any effect on the scale of the disaster and their consequence from which we be currently suffer . </s>
you know this budget . </s>
this be the framework in which I have to operate and I try , as I be responsible , together with Mrs Diamantopoulou , for Objective 3 , and with Mr Fischler for the EAGGF , to ensure that when we respond to these disaster immediately and in the medium term we be able to use this European money as efficiently as possible . </s>
I be therefore not oppose to change to these budgetary rule , and perhaps at the next budget , we will discuss this again , particularly in order to establish , at least in symbolic term , the emergency line which be discontinue two year ago . </s>
in the meantime , there be a great deal of money and , Mr Gollnisch , I can allow you to say that it will be use in some remote , hypothetical time . </s>
this money be available now , this year . </s>
if the national authority do their job properly , and I be sure that they will , we will be able to raise appropriation for specific problem and project from the middle of @card@ and in the next few year . </s>
this money be plentiful , even if it can , accord to Objective 2 , cover all the area affect . </s>
in particular , it could be make use of , and I be say this to Mr Liese , to Mrs Mathieu - and I do not mention a policy in its infancy where forestry be concern , Mrs Mathieu - to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert and to Mrs Schierhuber . </s>
in addition to Objective 2 , as regard forestry , a subject which I consider to be extremely important , that be the restoration of our forestry heritage , there be opportunity , apart from zoning , which the substantial appropriation from the EAGGF &quot; guarantee &quot; section have make possible . </s>
finally , I would like to say - or repeat - that not all of these disaster necessarily have natural cause . </s>
I say this with great humility . </s>
some of you be extremely knowledgeable and competent in these matter , even if , in the past , I have happen to write several work on ecological and environmental issue . </s>
indeed I think that through political will , we could limit the consequence of certain disaster . </s>
I think that this apply in the case of both flood and storm . </s>
Mr Kronberger , Mr Messner and Mrs González Álvarez mention the important issue of climate , and I would like to say that there be probably , somewhere , a link between the consequence of these natural disaster and the policy , for which Europe must remain one of the drive force for prevention , in term of the major environmental issue . </s>
I would like to thank you , Mr President , and Parliament , for give the Commission the opportunity to state its view . </s>
we shall now work , within the framework of the budget and the current rule , to ensure that the available appropriation , which you have make available to us , be use in the most constructive and rapid way , in order to deal with the consequence of these disaster . </s>
they must also provide an economic , political and human response to family that have be seriously affect by them . </s>
I have receive seven motion for resolution table pursuant to Rule @card@ ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
that conclude the debate . </s>
the vote will be take at noon on Thursday . </s>
food safety the next item be the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission . </s>
Mr President , I be very please to take this first available opportunity of outline to Parliament the main line of the Commission 's White Paper on food safety , adopt on Wednesday last , @card@ January , in association with my colleague , Mr Liikanen . </s>
at my hearing last September , I promise speedy delivery of this White Paper . </s>
I be happy that we have be able to deliver so quickly . </s>
the White Paper represent three to four month of intensive work since the new Commission be appoint last September . </s>
it take on board the extensive consultation of the past couple of year since the Commission 's Green Paper on food law be publish . </s>
equally it reflect our experience of recent food alert in such area as dioxin and sludge , as well as the BSE crisis . </s>
the White Paper also reflect the concern of this Parliament which you have outline to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasion we have debate food safety in this House since the Commission be appoint . </s>
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe 's food safety regime have be badly affect by the crisis and alert of recent year and month . </s>
the Commission be fully commit to restore that confidence by put in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world . </s>
when I launch the White Paper last week I say that the shopping trolley be one of the most potent weapon on the face of the earth . </s>
the most discerning decision be make by the consumer of Europe . </s>
if their confidence be damage this be reflect in shopping decision . </s>
this in turn have a dramatic effect on farmer , producer and industry generally . </s>
in an industry worth some EUR @card@ billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence level can have significant effect . </s>
between the agro-food sector and the farm sector there be over @card@ million employee . </s>
high level of confidence be necessary to boost job number and competitiveness . </s>
this crisis of confidence have also have the unfortunate but inevitable effect of erode the trust of consumer in the system and institution at national and European level that should monitor and assure the high standard of food safety . </s>
in say all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless have one of the good food industry in the world and also one of the safe food control system . </s>
the challenge be to make the system the very good . </s>
the overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety be to put in place the necessary legislation and structure that will guarantee the high possible level of health protection for consumer arise from the consumption of food . </s>
we be set out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change . </s>
the Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we be to achieve our ambition on schedule . </s>
we will also need the full support from the Council and other key stakeholder . </s>
the White Paper on food safety outline a comprehensive range of action need to complement and modernise existing Eu food legislation . </s>
all of these measure be design to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible . </s>
we want to promote good enforcement of that legislation and to provide great transparency to consumer . </s>
the detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper set a precise timetable for action over the next three year . </s>
over @card@ measure be envisage . </s>
our objective be to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of @card@ . </s>
we be also envisage the establishment of a European food authority by @card@ as an essential complement to the new food safety regime . </s>
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate . </s>
it have already attract much comment , include reaction from member of Parliament . </s>
the chapter of the White Paper devote to the establishment of a European food authority be clearly design to elicit view and comment . </s>
we be seek view by the end of April on what we envisage . </s>
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moment . </s>
the Commission believe that major structural change be require in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objective of assure the high standard of food safety and restore consumer confidence . </s>
why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ? </s>
the first key concern be independence . </s>
Key stakeholder , include consumer , be seek a system that be independent and perceive to be independent of all vested interest . </s>
we must also ensure excellence and transparency . </s>
we have make a lot of progress over the past couple of year since the reform system of scientific advice be adopt as a consequence of the BSE crisis . </s>
however , the Commission believe that we must go further . </s>
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment . </s>
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety . </s>
we envisage that the work of the exist five scientific committee devote to food safety will be transfer to the authority . </s>
they may not be transfer in their present form or structure - this be an issue on which we will elicit view before make our definitive proposal on the authority 's establishment . </s>
however , if we be merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough . </s>
as the White Paper make clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure . </s>
I be of the view that the existing system of scientific advice need to be strengthen . </s>
within the authority I envisage much strong scientific and other support for the independent scientist . </s>
I be also envisage that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issue before they become crisis . </s>
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority . </s>
To be proactive the White Paper identify a number of new area that would be embrace by the authority . </s>
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the Eu , and build up strong network with food safety agency and body in Member States . </s>
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operate an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concern . </s>
the Commission have decide that it be neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority . </s>
we believe that decision in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council . </s>
I make no apology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it be the correct one . </s>
certainly there be those who would argue that we should give law-making power to such an authority . </s>
I do not accept those view and reject them with some degree of passion . </s>
it be only last year that the Treaty be amend to give Parliament a much great role in the legislative process . </s>
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability . </s>
I will be very interested to hear the view of Parliament itself in relation to this matter . </s>
There be also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority . </s>
I also reject this line of argument . </s>
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ? </s>
Would this be in the interest of Europe 's citizen ? </s>
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific argument be soundly base , rationally argue and fully justify . </s>
it seem difficult to envisage such a situation evolve . </s>
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exercise its risk management function , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority . </s>
I have already say that the authority will be charge with develop network with national food safety agency and body in the Member States . </s>
this be a major task . </s>
we must develop great certainty in the science that underpin food safety in the European Union . </s>
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issue . </s>
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence be gain in the authority itself . </s>
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice base on science . </s>
however , with the evolution of dynamic network with national scientific body and agency , the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage . </s>
I be also anxious to hear the view of Parliament in this regard . </s>
as an integral part of a value-added structure , the White Paper propose that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute datum on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive . </s>
the White Paper also contain very important proposal in respect of control . </s>
this be a hugely important component of the system of check and balance to ensure that Member States and operator be comply with Community legislation . </s>
I want to see a genuine internal market operate in the control arena . </s>
in this context we be also propose to strengthen significantly the control function carry out by the food and veterinary office locate in Dublin . </s>
this revise Community framework would have three core element : operational criterion set up at Community level , Community control guideline , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control . </s>
as part of our proposal in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examine whether additional power in addition to infringement procedure need to be give to the Commission . </s>
these could include withhold Community financial support or recoup funding already commit to a Member State . </s>
these proposal must be see as part of our mission to have the high food safety standard in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase market for farmer and producer in the Union . </s>
in addition to the proposal for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level , the White Paper propose an action plan with a wide range of measure to improve and bring coherence to the Community 's legislation , cover all aspect of food product from farm to table . </s>
it set out over @card@ separate action that be envisage over the period ahead and intend to close identify loophole in current legislation . </s>
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminant and residue , novel food , additive , flavouring , packaging and irradiation . </s>
it will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principle of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturer , farmer and food operator , traceability of feed , food and ingredient , proper risk analysis through , for instance , risk assessment - that be , scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that be , regulation and control - risk communication , and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate . </s>
as regard the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission be currently finalise a communication which I expect to be adopt very soon . </s>
I look forward to have a useful exchange of view this afternoon with the member of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there have be an appropriate parliamentary forum available . </s>
however , have regard to my contact with the president of the relevant committee , I recognise that this be not feasible . </s>
but I know too that we will have many further opportunity in the come month to consider the White Paper 's proposal on the authority . </s>
we now have a number of month to have the necessary debate on the Commission 's idea on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority . </s>
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . </s>
Parliament play a crucial role in Europe 's response to the BSE crisis . </s>
it have especially active since then in bring citizen ' concern about food safety issue to the fore . </s>
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive . </s>
while we have a number of month to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our view , I recognise fully that this be also a very tight timeframe . </s>
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangement to ensure that its view can be formulate as quickly as possible . </s>
it be essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament 's contribution to the shape of what would be a key component of raise consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restore consumer confidence in the European Union 's food safety regime . </s>
the European food authority will be a key ingredient in the Eu 's food safety regime in the year ahead . </s>
it be essential that we get the mix right . </s>
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement . </s>
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have make and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institution , include the Commission and Parliament . </s>
that be very much the right approach . </s>
but there be one word that I have not hear you mention here tonight . </s>
I hope that we can thrash this out . </s>
we need a body of food law , as you have say , and we need to agree this together . </s>
it be very important that we include liability in that process . </s>
that be the one word I be talk about . </s>
the problem so far be that taxpayer pay when something go wrong . </s>
that can continue . </s>
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there be a problem , those responsible be liable . </s>
Mr President , it be a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority . </s>
my question relate to the positive list for animal feed . </s>
you be unclear about this in your White Paper . </s>
What be your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ? </s>
when will the same requirement be apply to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ? </s>
the final part of my question be as follow : when will BSE testing be bind in all Member States ? </s>
that be another point , I. E. the question of obligation , which you be somewhat unclear on in your White Paper . </s>
thank you , Commissioner , for your statement . </s>
I think the line that you have set up regard the Food Safety Authority be a recognition of reality . </s>
the Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there be not very much point in your propose one . </s>
some sector of the food industry clearly need good regulation and that be clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs . </s>
however , as chairman of a committee which look as though it will be concern itself almost entirely with food over the next three year , I have to ask : if Europe have the safe food control system , as you have say , why do we need @card@ new directive and regulation and @card@ new amend directive ? </s>
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States ? </s>
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this . </s>
regard enlargement : what plan do the Commission have to involve the applicant state in debate on these new law , give that the Commission clearly expect the law envisage in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by @card@ ? </s>
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their word of support in relation to the White Paper . </s>
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussion with them and other member of Parliament in relation to the issue that they raise . </s>
Mrs Ahern raise the issue of liability . </s>
that of course be not specifically address in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be put in place provision - and there be already some - relate to the issue of traceability . </s>
once that be do , issue such as liability can be address . </s>
I have not give full and detailed consideration to issue relate to and surround question of liability despite my background , but it seem to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issue involve . </s>
but I have take on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration . </s>
Mrs Roth-Behrendt ask me about establish a positive list . </s>
that be one of the issue that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention be to establish a positive list for feed material . </s>
at the moment the list be , as I say , a negative list and it be add to as require . </s>
the establishment of the positive list be one of the issue set out in the annex with a date attach to it , @card@ in fact . </s>
the rapid alert system for feed be something that we have identify as a gap in the legislation . </s>
rapid alert be there for food but not for feed . </s>
this be unfortunate and it be wrong , and we believe that it be important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be do . </s>
the work in relation to Bse in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify level of infectivity in Member States be ongoing , I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt have ask me this question before and I say I think it be come along quickly but I understand it be in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work be currently under way . </s>
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information . </s>
Mrs Jackson have focus on the fact that there be @card@ new and @card@ amend piece of legislation and ask whether this compound over-regulation . </s>
I should say that the piece of legislation that we have identify be intend to close gap in exist legislation . </s>
it be not so much a matter of the establishment of new regime or further regulation , although that be part of it , but of identify where there be gap and loophole in the chain from farm to table and close them . </s>
There be a reference to applicant state and that be something that we have in mind . </s>
standard of food safety and indeed other area of safety be obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this be a matter that I have draw to the attention of Mr Verheugen . </s>
Commissioner , the ignorance of certain Member States have land us in a major food crisis here in Europe , and I be afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no member of the Council be in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report . </s>
What I would very much like you to tell me be how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it go by , will be give influence over the Council , who in this authority will have the say in matter , and who will issue order . </s>
of course , we be not in a position to dictate anything in term of content , but I would insist on Parliament retain the right accord it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extend them . </s>
I very much fear that we be to have yet another authority that fly through Europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it do not come to that . </s>
I also welcome the White Paper . </s>
but do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough tooth to prevent something like the beef war that we have have and France 's refusal to lift the ban ? </s>
you mention the commission be able to withhold grant and subsidy from country who be act in the way that France be act . </s>
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payment for instance , similar to the one that the British farmer be ask for at the moment ? </s>
Mr President , you say during last week 's information session that it be your view that any future Eu food agency should not be locate on the periphery , but you do not mention what that periphery be . </s>
for example , the work of the Eu unit locate in Dublin have show that physical distance be no barrier these day to communication and have an effective influence on matter . </s>
it have be suggest that the most important task of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate datum , make recommendation for improve food safety , and - as you say - collect scientific datum and popularise that information for consumer . </s>
All this will be manage with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union . </s>
I would ask you on what you base your idea for a location ? </s>
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientist who will liaise with and consult with scientist who be expert in the particular field that be be consider at any particular time . </s>
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board . </s>
you will notice in the White Paper that we have not be specific about the makeup of that board . </s>
this be an issue which I expect will be discuss between Parliament and the Commission over the next few week and month . </s>
I envisage that the board 's membership will be make up from stakeholder or representative of stakeholder . </s>
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September . </s>
we have not do that yet but it will be do in September . </s>
I do not expect that the board will have any function in direct the scientist how to do their work . </s>
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice . </s>
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in request the authority to investigate particular area require research . </s>
Mr Florenz ask whether Parliament will have a say in that . </s>
that be an issue for consideration and discussion . </s>
There may be a number of view on that . </s>
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominee - to be member of the board . </s>
other may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nominee or even MEPs themselves , be able to have an opportunity to discuss what issue should be investigate . </s>
it be an issue for consideration but it have not be rule out . </s>
Mr Florenz also raise the question of anonymity . </s>
I be happy that he raise it because it be particularly important for this authority to have a high profile . </s>
it must be visible . </s>
it must be know . </s>
consumer in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority . </s>
the CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be know , who might appear regularly on television talk about issue relate to food , particularly in relation to the good news storey surround food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issue , so that if another food crisis come along consumer will be aware of the existence of the authority . </s>
they will be aware that they have hear from the authority before under other circumstance and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already build up in the pronouncement from the authority . </s>
it be fundamentally essential therefore that the authority be not anonymous . </s>
it must be visible . </s>
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority . </s>
Mrs Lynne ask whether the authority will have sufficient tooth . </s>
I suspect that the question be focus on the issue of where the competence of the authority begin and end and where the competence and authority of food safety agency in Member States begin and end . </s>
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level . </s>
quite clearly it be undesirable to have situation develop whereby scientist work for , or advise , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level . </s>
that be an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future . </s>
There be a number of thing that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information be one . </s>
but information which include a fundamental disagreement between scientist on core issue relate to food safety be also an issue of serious concern . </s>
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structure so as to ensure that there be a proper dissemination of information between scientist , that there be full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level have the opportunity and be mandate to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientist in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond , where expert be to be find elsewhere . </s>
over time , as I say a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raise but its expertise , its moral authority will be increase and enhance over a period of time so that its view be accept and not challenge . </s>
this situation can be achieve over a period of time . </s>
you can legislate for consumer confidence . </s>
it be something that be earn over a period of time . </s>
however , the Commission will have the possibility of see that the opinion of the Authority on scientific matter be enforce by way of pass legislation which be the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council . </s>
I realise that this be a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arise out of the opinion of the Authority be - I believe - the way forward . </s>
any failure to comply with legislation be a matter that can be deal with in the court in the normal way . </s>
One of the issue that we may have to address over time be the question of the speed of response in such circumstance . </s>
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a fast response from the court process . </s>
in relation to grant and subsidy : yes , consideration have be give to that issue . </s>
it will require the advice of legal service and that will be seek , particularly bear in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pend a court ruling . </s>
in relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payment : that be a matter that might very well be address by Parliament as it relate to budget issue . </s>
Mrs Myller then ask me about the location of the Authority . </s>
no decision have be take in relation to that other than to say that it be more likely that the Authority will be locate centrally rather than on the periphery . </s>
I recognise that the FEO be locate in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it be not the centre of Europe ! </s>
but the FVO be in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority . </s>
the FVO be make up of independent scientist and vet and so on who travel from some location where there be an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin . </s>
the Food Safety Authority 's situation be quite different . </s>
it have to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientist involve in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who be involve in the initiation of legislation . </s>
an important part of the communication between the two institution will obviously be to ensure that those of us who be involve in the draft of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it be the scientist mean , what problem they have identify , what legislation be necessary to deal with the issue they raise . </s>
equally , the scientist will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meet the ill that they have identify . </s>
it seem to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally locate . </s>
scientist will be employ in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientist on a consultative basis and , in those circumstance , as scientist will have to travel , it be probably well that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structure and the Commission and Council be base . </s>
that be my judgement at the moment . </s>
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestion that be make but my preliminary conclusion be that this Authority should be locate centrally rather than on the periphery . </s>
colleague , I be in a very difficult position because I can change the agenda . </s>
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political group and raise it in the conference of president . </s>
if you feel that these session after a Commission statement be important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that be allocate to them . </s>
on this occasion we have have six minute of question from the floor of the House and we have have @card@ minute of response by the Commissioner , and his statement . </s>
as you can see , half-an-hour be not really anything like enough time for such a session . </s>
I hope you might discuss this in your political group so that we can have a well structured session with the Commission on such future occasion . </s>
that conclude the debate . </s>
question Time ( Commission ) the next item be Question Time ( B5-0003 / @card@ ) . </s>
we will examine question to the Commission . </s>
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minute to Question Time . </s>
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreter be work today in continuous session . </s>
Mr Purvis have the floor for a procedural motion . </s>
I object to the fact that we be cut back the time for Question Time ; it be one of the few occasion when backbencher have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hour as be on the agenda . </s>
that be the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda . </s>
the fact be that the agenda say that we would begin at @card@ p. m. , and you can see the clock . </s>
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event . </s>
First Part Question no @card@ by ( H-0781 / @card@ ) : subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey the two recent earthquake in Turkey register more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubt about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactor at Akkuyu , while energy reserve produce by the Atatürk dam be export to third country and the Eu spend a slice of its budget on repair the damage wrought by the earthquake . </s>
Turkey 's nuclear plan ? </s>
which ignore the risk to the population and ecosystem of Turkey and the surround region ? </s>
prompt the suspicion that there be underlie plan previously determine by Turkey 's political and military leader to acquire nuclear technology enable them to build nuclear weapon , as evidence by their attempt to buy reactor of Canadian origin of the type acquire by India and Pakistan . </s>
What step will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accident and the proliferation of nuclear weapon in a country that wish to join the Eu but spend enormous amount on nuclear programme while receive financial aid from the Eu budget ? </s>
Mr Verheugen have the floor on behalf of the Commission . </s>
the Commission be follow with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu , Turkey and recognise the importance of ensure that the construction of the new plant follow the high internationally accept nuclear safety standard . </s>
accord to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder have not be take yet . </s>
the Commission acknowledge the fact that Turkey have sign and ratify the convention on nuclear safety and recognise that the responsibility for grant licence and regulate the site , construction , commission , operation and decommission of nuclear power plant in Turkey rest entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority . </s>
the Commission do not have a mandate to impose any limit on decision take by any country in term of energy production , include the nuclear option . </s>
as Commissioner Wallström indicate during the hearing in the European Parliament in September @card@ , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish government in the future and I be happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of day and will certainly raise the issue . </s>
in particular , the Commission be aware of the public concern about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line locate in the vicinity of the propose plant site . </s>
accord to information receive from the International Atomic Agency , the design of the plant take into account the possibility of earthquake strong than any ever record in the area and particularly more than ten time strong than the one register in June @card@ in Adana . </s>
large design margin be be provide in order to ensure safe operation of the plant accord to the environmental condition of the site . </s>
the Commission be also aware of concern about the possible intention of use the plant to produce weapons-grade material . </s>
it acknowledge the fact that Turkey have sign and ratify the Treaty on the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and have subsequently conclude a comprehensive safeguard agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency . </s>
thank you for your reply . </s>
I should like to make the follow point : Turkey be now a candidate country . </s>
this plan be design to increase its energy potential by 2 % . </s>
at the same time , it also wish to acquire Cadou type reactor from Canada , which we now know have already be use for nuclear weapon in Pakistan and India . </s>
in this sense , there be therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus call for a nearby country with weapon grade nuclear technology . </s>
so much for the political aspect . </s>
now to the technical aspect . </s>
the safety factor in this type of project , and I be speak as an engineer , have nothing to do with increase safety level in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty . </s>
in case such as this , where there be uncertainty , simulator be use . </s>
however , we can use simulator in case relate to nuclear energy . </s>
in this sense , all high seismic risk area must be exclude a priori for nuclear installation such as this . </s>
therefore , and give that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey have now change , it would be a good idea if Turkey discuss certain matter relate both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union . </s>
a couple of week ago we have a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate country . </s>
I have explain the position of the Commission . </s>
you have to accept the fact that there be no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety . </s>
so what we do be use political mean to convince some candidate country that we have to have decommission plan for some reactor that be consider not to be upgradable . </s>
in the case of Turkey it be different . </s>
the plant be not yet there . </s>
I have already say that Turkey be part of the NPT and of the convention on Nuclear Safety . </s>
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there be concern about safety we will discuss it with Turkey . </s>
if the conclusion be that Turkey be plan to build a nuclear power plant that do not meet normal European safety standard be concern then we would do the same as we do with Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria . </s>
Mr President , the Commissioner say that Turkey have sign the non-proliferation treaty , it have sign the nuclear safety treaty : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepare to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter ? </s>
I think it be the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concern and fear . </s>
I do not have these concern . </s>
I believe that Turkey completely recognise the standard and the criterion of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there be no doubt that there be concern in the public in Europe and I think it be quite right to discuss them here in Parliament . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0786 / @card@ ) : subject : deplete uranium weapon have the Commission conduct any study of the potential effect upon Eu state of transboundary pollution arise from the use of deplete uranium weapon in the Kosovan conflict ? </s>
if not , why not ? </s>
Mrs Wallström have the floor on behalf of the Commission . </s>
thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question . </s>
the European Commission have monitor the environmental effect of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action . </s>
as early as last June the Commission finance a first study . </s>
it be carry out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and conclude that there have be no large-scale ecological catastrophe . </s>
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis have overturn that original assessment . </s>
the Commission have also be closely associate with the production of the recent report publish by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force . </s>
this be the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effect of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet study it . </s>
the use of deplete uranium weapon be one of the many issue consider and this report be now widely available also on the net . </s>
the Balkan Task Force be hamper by the fact that little or no information be available on the actual use of these weapon during the conflict . </s>
no indication of contamination be find in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission . </s>
however , this do not exclude the possibility that area in Kosovo be contaminate by deplete uranium . </s>
from a desk assessment couple with a fact-finding mission the report conclude that the risk , if any , be limit to an area around the target . </s>
future action will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe . </s>
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan be also be develop . </s>
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combat war damage if such action should be need . </s>
first of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response . </s>
clearly the Commission have give some consideration to this problem and I be please that these report which have be produce so far have look carefully at the issue . </s>
but I would like to point out that the concern with deplete uranium weapon be about the way in which they be use . </s>
this uranium become air-borne , be inhale and could now be effectively carry by member of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effect than it have be possible to establish so far . </s>
this seem to be the pattern of event that have emerge after the use of deplete uranium weapon in the Gulf war . </s>
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effect , not just of deplete uranium weapon but of some of the other effect on the environment that we do know have occur at least in a localise way within Kosovo ? </s>
How long will you continue to monitor the effect of these weapon ? </s>
thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question . </s>
we have to state again that there be still no confirmation that deplete uranium be use in the conflict and no deplete uranium have be detect in the clean-up of Kosovo . </s>
but those symptom and those problem that you mention could be there and that could be the effect of the use of deplete uranium . </s>
that be also mention in the report . </s>
no transboundary effect have be detect and most of the weapon will have be use on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . </s>
the problem be that the current political isolation of the country mean that access to this area be restrict . </s>
a big responsibility rest with the United Nations because they be address with this report , so they have to take responsibility . </s>
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that be , for the time be , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union . </s>
it be important to follow up and it give the Member States , as well as the United Nations and the Commission , something to think about when it be a matter concern military secret and their effect on the environment . </s>
it also have a long-term effect on think when it come to the use of these sort of weapon . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few month ' time , hundred of thousand of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday . </s>
we know from medium report that bomb and weapon be dump just off the coast . </s>
be you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and be there any measure in the pipeline for ascertain what the danger might be in this respect ? </s>
I wish I could give guarantee for many thing but unfortunately I be not able to . </s>
we make our judgement from report like this and the mission we send to check on thing like this . </s>
that be what we rely on when we advise people on what to do . </s>
What we have see be that war affect the environment in the long term and be dangerous . </s>
in the environmental field we have just pass a directive on marine pollution . </s>
that also include bullet and weapon and so on and it be an early warning system . </s>
unfortunately we be not able to give guarantee and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise . </s>
I want to ask the Commissioner whether it be true that soldier of the NATO armed force now station in that region undergo special control against nuclear radiation and that the same measure be not apply to civilian live in the area ? </s>
I can answer that question . </s>
when it come to medical check and so on , I do not have all the information need to give a proper answer . </s>
What we know from the environmental side be what I have already mention , that there be now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it come to medical check-up I do not have the information about that . </s>
of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0793 / @card@ ) : subject : appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet in @card@ the Tibetan government in exile receive over @card@ Tibetan who escape over the Himalayan mountain seek freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb . </s>
Many of the refugee have be severely frost-bitten and many have die along the way . </s>
the Tibet Intergroup be very concern about the worsen situation in Tibet and it be clear that the current policy of the European Union have prove inadequate to address the grave human right abuse face by Tibetan daily in Tibet . </s>
the Tibet Intergroup , therefore , gravely concern about the continue human right abuse in Tibet and support the Dalai Lama ? </s>
s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese government to resolve the situation in Tibet , call on the Commission to appoint a special Envoy for Tibet to address the concern of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authority together for dialogue . </s>
when will the Commission appoint a special Envoy for Tibet ? </s>
Mr Patten have the floor on behalf of the Commission . </s>
the concern express by the European Parliament about Tibet be widely share . </s>
I have long believe in the need to set out our view on human right issue , include Tibet , firmly and candidly to the Chinese authority . </s>
the European Union do that at the European Union ­ China Summit in Peking last month where we press the Chinese on a number of human right issue , include Tibet . </s>
we again urge the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama . </s>
I urge the Chinese again to do so . </s>
we will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authority . </s>
we be also do a number of other thing : in the European Union-China human right dialogue , we have focus on a number of practical step , include send expert on assignment to Tibet , plan development assistance programme and activity focus on health , education and training for Tibetan . </s>
the appointment of an Eu special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them . </s>
but for my part , I be not sure that it would add much practical value to our effort . </s>
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authority and we already have effective channel of communication with the Tibetan community in exile . </s>
I be also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoy , however worthy the cause . </s>
Mr President , Mr Patten , of course , you be very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spend in China , and you be well aware of how hard the Tibetan be try to initiate a debate , something which have always be block hitherto . </s>
however , if your response be to be that we should turn to &quot; Mr CFSP &quot; , that be , to Mr Solana , then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter . </s>
your approach , which I be very much in favour of , since it be a coherent one , take its inspiration from the issue of human right ; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human right . </s>
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young woman and so on and so forth , be definitely issue that we could discuss ad infinitum . </s>
if we cut down here and say that the Council now share responsibility for this , then I fear that these human right issue will not be give the attention they deserve . </s>
the possibility of stress the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also make very sure that we include human right in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission , rather than say that it be a matter for the Council . </s>
let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position be . </s>
I state nothing but the truth when I say that the appointment of special envoy be a matter for the Council . </s>
as it happen , we deal with the budgetary consequence , the Council make the appointment . </s>
some may think that the budgetary point should be look at in due course . </s>
put that on one side , because that be the situation , it do not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human right issue . </s>
I be very much hope in the next few month that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human right point out , among other thing , that there be no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human right in China or other place in the world and the trading and commercial interest and other interest of the European Union . </s>
I have long believe that we should all recognise that country where it be well to do business be country that treat their own citizen most decently - everywhere in the world . </s>
I repeat that we have make our position know to the Chinese on Tibet . </s>
during the few month that I have be a Commissioner that have happen twice , first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest . </s>
if I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member , who I recognise be interested in these subject , I recommend to him a book publish just before Christmas write by Isabel Hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problem of Tibet . </s>
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betoken peace and happiness . </s>
we be not just talk about human right and the environment where Tibet be concern , rather it be about a unique cultural heritage that be also able to communicate important value such as peace , serenity , compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans . </s>
the question before us now be what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness , the Dalai Lama 's , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ? </s>
I would point out that do nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people . </s>
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member have say about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition . </s>
like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama . </s>
it be an extremely move account , not just of his responsibility in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual view as well . </s>
the Commission , like other , have urge dialogue . </s>
the Dalai Lama have make it clear that peaceful dialogue be what he wish . </s>
I wish that the Chinese authority have respond consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama . </s>
at or around the time of President Clinton 's visit to China , the President of the People 's Republic of China give the impression that dialogue be on the agenda . </s>
it would be very beneficial , not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the People 's Republic of China if they be to respond to those attempt to begin a dialogue . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0795 / @card@ ) : subject : Commission 's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the Eu accord to newspaper report , the Commission have reject the proposal by Eu Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizen ? </s>
right to proper administration in the Eu . </s>
although the Commission have itself approve the idea of legislation on proper administration , it have not now accept a detailed proposal that have be make , but have decide to issue a whole set of additional guideline on improve service . </s>
be these report accurate ? </s>
What be the reason for the Commission ? </s>
s act in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its word and its action on the reform of Eu administration ? </s>
do the Commission consider that what have happen be compatible with the five-point programme agree between Parliament and the Commission in September , and be it prepare to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allow Parliament to express an opinion on it ? </s>
Mr Patten have the floor on behalf of the Commission . </s>
the newspaper report that the honourable Member make reference to seem to me to be mislead and inaccurate . </s>
in November @card@ the commission approve at first read a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporate into its rule of Procedure . </s>
at the moment the Commission be consult its staff representative on the document , a process which will be finalise in the forthcoming week . </s>
the Commission will then adopt the code at second reading . </s>
it should be note that the new Commission give an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of @card@ July @card@ in his own-initiative inquiry relate to the code . </s>
the Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the draft of the code , it have take on board all the draft recommendation of the European Ombudsman . </s>
the code will be a document exclusively deal with the relation of the Commission 's administration with the public . </s>
it will be adopt through a legally-binding Commission decision to be publish in the Official Journal of the European community . </s>
the document have be draw up take full account of the provision contain in the draft prepare by the European Ombudsman 's office . </s>
accord to the related provision in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establish its rule of Procedure be the Commission itself . </s>
however , it go without say that the Commission adhere to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspect of administrative reform . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner . </s>
however , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bear in mind that it have be on the agenda since @card@ . </s>
the newspaper report be mislead . </s>
I do not think there be any difference between us and the Ombudsman . </s>
There be a question about the legislative base on which we have take the good advice and I think we be soundly place on that . </s>
I want to repeat that honourable member , like the honourable Member who ask the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it . </s>
it be extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member . </s>
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer . </s>
for safety 's sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really be the case that , where the Commission and good administration be concern , there be no part of Jacob Söderman 's proposal which the Commission think be unacceptable . </s>
be it true that the content of all part of the proposal will be approve ? </s>
let me read what it say in my brief - and as it be in my brief it must be true ! </s>
&quot; I would like to stress again that the Commission have accept all the Ombudsman 's recommendation contain in his draft recommendation of July @card@ &quot; . </s>
both document , that be the Commission 's document and the Ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground . </s>
the only substantial question that have arise be the legislative basis . </s>
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there be no doubt that we be on all four with the Ombudsman on this important issue . </s>
we will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten 's note into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the member to bear in mind . </s>
as the author be not present , Question no @card@ lapse . </s>
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . </s>
I be sorry . </s>
accord to the Rules of Procedure , you be not require to reply . </s>
I wish you a good evening . </s>
second part question to Mr Nielson , who be replace by Mr Patten Questions @card@ and @card@ of question to the Commission be intend for Mr Nielson . </s>
Mr Nielson can be present today since he be in South Africa . </s>
I must tell you that the vice-president of the Commission , Mrs Loyola de Palacio , have send me a kind letter give me all sort of explanation and inform me that Mr Patten will reply to the question . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0829 / @card@ ) : subject : ' Mainstreaming ' in Eu aid policy in @card@ the council draw up guideline for integrate the equal opportunity dimension ( ' mainstreaming ' ) into the full range of Eu aid policy . </s>
the guideline call for all staff work in the development sector to receive continuous training in ' gender mainstreaming ' but in recent year only around @card@ people have be train and there be still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate-General for Development . </s>
' Mainstreaming ' mean take account of equality between woman and man as an integral part of all form of development policy , strategy and measure . </s>
To achieve that , the Council 's guideline must be implement in their entirety . </s>
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunity and @card@ day ' training in such issue should form an essential part of the Directorate-General for Development 's introductory course for new staff . </s>
be the Commission prepare to take such measure ? </s>
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , Mr Nielson , be that he could not be here but the honourable member who be concern about these development question will know how important his mission be , try to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survive . </s>
the Commission be prepare to look at the possibility of make an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction course for new staff , something that have be do already but not , I admit , on a regular basis . </s>
the training of staff move to the delegation in the different region be another entry point . </s>
the training then would be automatically perform without be compulsory . </s>
we also aim to include training in these issue in the basic training that our official receive in project cycle management . </s>
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically build into programme at the outset , instead of have to be tackle separately and later . </s>
my own view as a former development minister be that these issue should be mainstreamed themselves and tackle at the heart of training and not turn into a sort of optional add-on . </s>
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all level . </s>
it be not to be bring in as a &quot; sort of optional add-on &quot; . </s>
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goal and strategy , together with a transformation of institution and process so that both woman 's and man 's priority and need be well reflect . </s>
in addition , measure must be take to combat difference on the ground of gender . </s>
equality must permeate not only project and programme but also all overarching goal , action plan and strategy . </s>
it would appear that we be in agreement about this . </s>
however , responsibility for ensure that due attention be give to equality lie with departmental and unit manager . </s>
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority . </s>
extremely few member of the Directorate-General for Development , that be to say unit manager and more senior manager , have take part in the gender course that have be organise . </s>
only one manager have participate in gender training , and for half a day . </s>
that be naturally unacceptable . </s>
What be the Commission prepare to do to ensure that unit manager and more senior manager go through the necessary gender training ? </s>
gender have in fact be include in the compulsory introductory course for new employee , but then with only one to two hour devote to it on each course . </s>
this limited training element have , however , be remove from all introductory course which have take place in recent time . </s>
as I point out in my question , one to two day , and not one to two hour , need to be devote to the subject . </s>
my question be this : be the Commission really prepare to comply with the adopt guideline for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development ? </s>
well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so do my colleague Commissioner Nielson . </s>
I must not go on about book , but I have just be read the book by David Landis Barnhill on what make some country prosperous and some country less prosperous and it be interesting to see there the importance that he attach to gender issue , in the economic prosperity and political stability of society , go back millennium . </s>
secondly , in my view , while the training that we be talk about should not be compulsory - after all there be no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential . </s>
and , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they have adequate gender training . </s>
that go for everybody at whatever level of seniority . </s>
it be not something which more senior official can deem appropriate for their junior but think that they be too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves . </s>
thirdly , one of the good approach to this issue be to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular course for development official and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which be key to good management of project on the ground . </s>
so I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member have say . </s>
I hope the approach that we be follow both demonstrate practicality and the imperative of give this the attention which it deserve . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0831 / @card@ ) : subject : aid for Central Asia What development aid and what humanitarian aid do the Commission grant to the country of Central Asia , and what be its assessment of the impact of this aid ? </s>
question to Mrs Diamantopoulou since @card@ , the Community have provide significant financial support to the New Independent States include the country of central Asia . </s>
the major part of European Union aid have be provide under the TACIS programme . </s>
in @card@ and @card@ Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan receive technical assistance of EUR @card@ million . </s>
this assistance have deliver benefit in all sector , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institution . </s>
security consideration have prevent Tajikistan from benefit fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR @card@ million have be in place in @card@ and @card@ . </s>
in addition to national programme , the European Union have support important regional action in the energy , transport and environmental sector . </s>
food security programme in central Asia begin in @card@ , follow two previous year when the European Union provide food aid in kind . </s>
these programme have benefit Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan . </s>
Funding for Ngo programme in Tajikistan amount to EUR @card@ million in @card@ and @card@ . </s>
over the same period , Kyrgyzstan receive EUR @card@ million . </s>
since @card@ the Commission 's European Community Humanitarian Office , Echo , have be active in support the most vulnerable group and sector in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan . </s>
in @card@ and @card@ EUR @card@ million be grant to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan receive over EUR @card@ million , mainly for food , medical supply , water and sanitation . </s>
frequent monitoring and situation assessment have show that European Union assistance be contribute to the stability of these country and therefore the ongoing peace process . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , there be a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea become the Balkans of the 21st century . </s>
that be why it be imperative to stabilise the two major state of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular . </s>
that be why I would like to ask you what you be actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiation with regard to the partnership agreement with these two country be go , that be , with regard to political relation that be . </s>
of course , that fall within your remit ; my next question fall within Mr Nielson 's remit in that it concern environmental cooperation , in particular matter pertain to water and the problem surround the cotton monoculture , which be the cause of great aridity . </s>
we be able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of week ago , to meet and have discussion with some of the central Asian republic . </s>
I be very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them . </s>
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreement with each of the central Asian republic . </s>
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future be on the gloomy side . </s>
but I have no doubt at all that he be right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia . </s>
I have hear the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well . </s>
he be absolutely right to say that a union which talk about conflict prevention should be look at what it can do in these particular area to ensure that there be not the sort of conflict in the future which have cause so much devastation in the Balkans and which have cost us a great deal more than we might have have to spend otherwise , have we take more pre-emptive measure if those have be possible . </s>
so the honourable Member 's remark about the strategic importance of these region be extremely well make . </s>
we be contribute to programme in the region which have some ecological impact . </s>
our food programme be directly relate to structural reform in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation . </s>
those programme themselves be intend to ensure that agriculture have a more soundly base position in those society and do not consist simply of rape the land . </s>
There be an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to . </s>
we also take good note of the fact that the Member who have ask the question have applaud the Commissioner 's answer . </s>
this be not the usual state of affair . </s>
and furthermore the Commissioner have not quote from his bibliography this time . </s>
thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your intervention today . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0778 / @card@ ) : subject : Greek action plan for employment accord to the finding of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment , Greece and Italy be the main target for criticism from the Commission for not properly carry out employment support measure and policy . </s>
the report state that in Greece and Italy target for improve ? </s>
employability ? </s>
have not yet be reach and it be doubtful whether the policy to be implement will enable the guideline on prevent and deal with long-term unemployment to be comply with . </s>
the report also comment that in Greece there be no plan for medium to long-term measure aim at reduce employment tax and insurance charge , or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resource to support employment policy , and , in addition , that there be no exact employment figure . </s>
Could the Commission say whether the Greek government have make any specific commitment on how to tackle the problem of youth and long-term unemployment , and what these commitment be ? </s>
have the government legislate for and put into place a suitable system for pinpoint , record and monitor fluctuation in unemployment , or be most of the measure perhaps still limit to count those out of work ? </s>
as far as Mr Papayannakis ' question be concern , in the @card@ Action Plan for Employment , the Commission propose certain recommendation for Greece with a view to improve the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment . </s>
the most important recommendation relate to the need to improve effort to reform public sector service , where problem exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policy in accordance with guideline 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment . </s>
the Greek government introduce two specific programme in @card@ as part of its employment policy : &quot; yes to work &quot; and &quot; back to work &quot; . </s>
we do not yet have the final result of these programme and can yet tell if the quantitative objective be achieve . </s>
the Greek government acknowledge the problem of its be unable to record human resource enter and leave work and be therefore commit , firstly , to restructure public sector employment service in Greece , secondly , to set up efficient employment promotion centre - this programme have already start but have not yet be complete - and , thirdly , to introduce a system of electronic employment card and use suitable it system to monitor all these policy . </s>
in the new programme submit for the period from @card@ to @card@ , which be be finance from the Social Fund , both the resource and the policy should be use , with the Commission 's support , to implement the objective which I refer to earlier . </s>
the Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek government in order to ensure that it honour the commitment which it have make . </s>
thank you , Commissioner for your reply . </s>
however , our current situation be as follow : at @card@ % , we have the second high unemployment in Europe , which be not previously the case , we have the big increase in unemployment , we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed , i. e. less than 1 % of GDP , while other country , such as France , Belgium and Germany spend @card@ % , and it be not clear how the money receive from the Social Fund have be use , inter alia , to combat unemployment . </s>
you tell me that you , as the Commission , have make recommendation . </s>
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendation will be adhere to . </s>
however , my question for a very long time have be this : what happen with previous policy ? </s>
do anyone find work ? </s>
How many people find work ? </s>
if you can tell us for this year , then last year and the year before . </s>
What have be do about training ? </s>
be the purpose of the famous training centre to provide job for instructor or trainee ? </s>
do we have any figure ? </s>
in other word , do we have way of check what be happen with this government policy in Greece ? </s>
Mr Papayannakis , the only answer I can give you be that the Greek government do indeed need to step up effort to introduce computerise statistical record and to set up structure so that the programme implement have the quantitative result which you mention , and so that monitoring can be carry out and use as a basis for formulate policy . </s>
Greece have see an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity . </s>
the action which the Commission can take relate to the specific guideline . </s>
as you know , there be @card@ guideline on which each country be evaluate . </s>
they concern access to training , the ratio of man to woman with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed . </s>
the Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guideline , to quantify the datum and to obtain specific information base on the implementation of the new Community framework for @card@ to @card@ . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0782 / @card@ ) : subject : Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme have be approve in its entirety and whether there be disagreement between Denmark and the Commission in other area of social policy ? </s>
the Danish pension scheme , the Efterløn , only allow people resident in Denmark and people who have complete the require period of employment in Denmark to retire . </s>
some worker have complain to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire . </s>
the Danish authority do not consider that they be oblige under Community law to pay this compensation to worker take early retirement who do not meet the condition require under Danish law . </s>
it should be note that the current regulation on social security system do not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission have propose certain amendment to the regulation which be , however , still pend before the Council . </s>
There be , as yet , no European Court case law on Efterløn , but it could validly be argue that the residence requirement be incompatible with general clause now in force ban discrimination on the ground of nationality . </s>
the Commission service set up a procedure for joint meeting and discussion with the Danish government with a view to find a common language and a common approach . </s>
the last meeting on the subject be hold in November @card@ and we be wait for the Commission service ' final proposal on whether or not infringement proceeding will be institute against Denmark . </s>
I notice that the Commissioner do not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole have be approve by the Commission , but it be indirectly apparent that the answer be that it have not be . </s>
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme have not be approve by the Commission . </s>
the Commissioner also more than hint , of course , that a lot of consideration be be give to bring the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , specifically on the ground that the scheme actually discriminate against non-Danish wage earner who be unable to fulfil the condition , due to the fact that they have not be in pay work for the period require under the Danish system . </s>
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadline in connection with this matter , for it be a problem which need clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate . </s>
so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question . </s>
Honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States be have problem interpret the directive and transpose them into national law . </s>
this be one such case and discussion be under way between the Danish government and the Commission in order to find the well possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the worker who meet the requirement and who , as thing stand , have a right to this pension . </s>
briefly , just to follow on from that last point , I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission 's objection , such as they be , would not in any way infringe the right of Danish national to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the Commission have a concern , which it have the right to have under Community law , to ensure that the scheme apply to all Eu citizen who qualify . </s>
I think that the answer be brief and clear . </s>
of course it be as you say . </s>
There will be no problem with Danish national within Denmark , that be not where the problem lie . </s>
the problem be with Danish national or other national reside outside Denmark . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0791 / @card@ ) : subject : work time directive Can the Commission say what action it propose take to ensure a level of protection , equivalent to that provide by the @card@ work time directive , for non-consultant hospital doctor , who be exclude from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amend directive ( COM ( @card@ ) 0662-C4-0715 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( SYN ) ) ? </s>

the content of the proposal concern the average 48-hour work week of doctor , with the possibility , follow negotiation , of increase it to @card@ hour . </s>
the Council , Commission and Parliament be all agree on the content but there be disagreement on the transitional period for implement the directive . </s>
Parliament have propose 4 year , the Commission 7 and the Council @card@ . </s>
this proposal be still be discuss by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure . </s>
although there be this disagreement , I should stress that all three institution agree on the content and that every effort be be make to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concern an exceptionally large number of work doctor throughout Europe . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0805 / @card@ ) : subject : measure to advance gender equality One of the work group of commissioner announce by President Prodi have as its objective the promotion of measure to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) . </s>
which commissioner be member of this group ? </s>
How many meeting of the group have be hold to date ? </s>

this question cover several individual matter . </s>
it refer to the special Commission work group deal with question of equality . </s>
the commissioner take part be President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself . </s>
the meeting of the work group be open and the first meeting be hold on @card@ January @card@ . </s>
Three serious issue be discuss : the first be the first discussion on the fifth programme for woman , of which I give an initial evaluation , the second issue be the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of woman in research and science , and the third involved Mr Kinnock , who report to the work group on effort be make to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reform currently take place in the Community . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner , for your reply , although I regret the fact that this work group have take so long to meet , since this matter be of the great importance . </s>
we trust this Commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issue relate to great equality for man and woman . </s>
I hope that , in the future , thing will change and meeting will become frequent , because there be many issue which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measure which will promote great equality between man and woman . </s>
Mrs Avilés-Perea , that be an exhortation rather than a question . </s>
but if the Commissioner wish to offer doctrine or good intention ... Allow me to say just one word . </s>
I agree that the work group should have meet earlier but at least , once it do , important decision be take straight away . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0807 / @card@ ) : subject : Community Equal initiative on @card@ October @card@ , the Commission adopt the Community 's Equal initiative , the aim of which be transnational cooperation to find and develop new mean of combat discrimination and inequality in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seeker . </s>
under this umbrella , each Member State be to submit proposal in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country . </s>
What criterion will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programme ? </s>
which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitor committee and verify that the programme be carry out exactly and correctly ? </s>
the European Social Fund contribution for the period @card@ will total 2 @card@ billion euro . </s>
as the Equal initiative be a joint funding venture with the Member States , what will Greece 's contribution amount to ? </s>
the Equal initiative be not restrict to certain group of people . </s>
its purpose be to combat discrimination in the workplace . </s>
the decision on this initiative be take in Berlin , where it be decide to take account of professional group of asylum seeker and to include them in its action . </s>
this be an important aspect of this initiative . </s>
the Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation . </s>
this be the same as the Social Fund regulation , I. E. Equal come under the Social Fund regulation . </s>
it have be submit to Parliament and we expect Parliament 's opinion next month . </s>
I should like to stress that the Equal initiative satisfy national requirement and national plan define in accordance with agree European strategy . </s>
the Member States , I. E. the national government , have primary responsibility for set up the joint agency , submit proposal , select the proposal which the programme will implement and carry out primary control . </s>
within the European Commission , the Directorate-General for Employment be responsible for implementation , while financial control be the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control , the Anti-Fraud Office and the European court of auditor . </s>
the last question concern the amount grant . </s>
Greece have be grant ECU @card@ million . </s>
the contribution commitment be @card@ % , rise to an @card@ % contribution from the initiative for the island region , especially the remote Greek island , and a contribution by Greece of @card@ % . </s>
Mr President , I feel that the guideline for the Community Equal initiative , especially the four action describe in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure . </s>
for example , one wonder how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as require by action 2 in paragraph @card@ of the guideline . </s>
at the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demand of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structure , as these be the only structure which can meet such demand . </s>
however , this contradict the stated aim of the general objective for decentralise action plan at the level of local authority and rural area . </s>
however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminate against , such as asylum seeker , immigrant and so on , be render impossible or merely symbolic . </s>
finally , if you consider the overall amount , which be on the small side , - EUR @card@ billion for @card@ Member States - and how ambitious the objective be , I be afraid that all we shall succeed in do be to prove that unemployment be a bad thing . </s>
First let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reach the stage where this be be process by Parliament , if you could make specific proposal which we could take into account . </s>
secondly , I have to say that the aim of the Equal initiative be not to reduce unemployment , it can possibly deal with the issue of reduce unemployment , or to support an increase in employment . </s>
that be the job of the European strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sum of money and exceptionally large resource at their disposal , especially for country like Greece . </s>
the Equal initiative have a specific mission . </s>
To encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistic , to create study and agency to support those section of the population which suffer discrimination . </s>
so what we be look for be cooperation between local group , between local authority and between country in order to exchange experience ; that be mainly what we be look for , and for experience to be transfer from one country to another so that it can be emulate . </s>
this be the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget be commensurate with it and our aim be for development agency , non-governmental organisation and local authority to be involve as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0808 / @card@ ) : subject : article @card@ TEU and Employment the draft Commission Directive establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation give exemption to religious organisation ( Art . </s>
@card@ ) . </s>
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstance and the group within Article @card@ ( TEU ) likely to be effect by such an exemption ? </s>
a month ago , the Commission submit a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribe in the Treaty , in order to implement Article @card@ . </s>
the ban on discrimination be the rule in the package of directive and programme which we submit . </s>
at the Commission 's proposal and after approximately two year of consultation with social agency , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exception have be make . </s>
these exception relate to profession which must be exercise by person with a genuine professional qualification . </s>
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this . </s>
in a religious school , it be logical for an exemption to be request and accept in order to ensure that the teacher be of the faith to which the religious school in question belong . </s>
that be the sort of exemption we be talk about . </s>
clearly this be not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provision be only justify in the case of this special professional qualification . </s>
this be a perverse interpretation of end discrimination . </s>
for instance , religious school could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you be a gay man or because you be a lesbian . </s>
here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression . </s>
surely what we should be do , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , be engage the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely hold . </s>
I must stress that this exemption be not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mention , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason . </s>
it allow a choice to be make only where special qualification be needed which relate directly to the activity in question . </s>
in other word , it be positive discrimination . </s>
in the example which you mention , it be only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic . </s>
that be the only form of exemption which be acceptable . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0813 / @card@ ) : subject : promote job for woman in severely less-favoured region give the enormous difficulty in obtain work which woman face in certain severely less-favoured region , and give that these woman very seldom have any resource to draw on , in term of either finance , entrepreneurial or cooperative tradition or even training facility , live as they do in rural district where @card@ % of the population be on the poverty line , what measure or action be plan to help these woman overcome the hurdle of their social environment ? </s>
do the Commission intend to put forward low common denominator policy which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these woman , or will their plight once again be overlook by the new employment policy ? </s>
obviously , the cohesion policy exist for less-favoured region and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy . </s>
I should point out that the fund available for region with problem account for one third of the total budget . </s>
the aim of these regional policy , which , of course , be implement under the jointly agree European guideline in each Member State , I. E. each Member State be responsible for implement this programme , be to increase opportunity for work for both man and woman . </s>
I should point out that @card@ % of funding for the period @card@ , I. E. EUR @card@ billion , will go to the less-favoured region of Europe . </s>
with particular reference now to the question of access by woman to the opportunity which be create , I would like to say , first , that there be , via the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunity pillar which the Member States must implement , i. e. special policy for woman which must use Social Fund resource . </s>
secondly , the Leader initiative currently be study give special priority to development strategy which aim to give special support to woman in small enterprise in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increase the involvement of woman in agricultural region . </s>
Commissioner , thank you for give me a well-intentioned answer , which have be rigorous and well-argued . </s>
however , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measure - which you have refer to - reach these severely less-favoured region . </s>
they be area where there be much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those area where we work in cooperation , where almost none exist . </s>
therefore , my question be whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policy on microcredits , which have bring result in cooperation , could be apply to those woman in severely less-favoured region , who have the odd stack against them . </s>
I be very familiar with the programme which you refer to . </s>
I can assure you that we be not reach the area where there be most need . </s>
with these forecast of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecast of Leader and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst woman in the severely less-favoured region . </s>
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of apply microcredit policy . </s>
the Commissioner accept and take good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo 's intervention . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0817 / @card@ ) : subject : Commission 's plan for presentation of a new social action programme it be important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , set out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiative for framework agreement in the context of the ' social dialogue ' . </s>
Can the Commission say what its precise intention be regard the presentation of a new social action programme ? </s>
we estimate that the Commission 's new social action programme for the next five year will be ready at the end of this summer . </s>
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultation with Parliament , the social partner and non-governmental organisation . </s>
these discussion have already start , but we will need to take account of the result in Lisbon . </s>
the Lisbon European Council be try to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reform . </s>
these result will be most important in shape the Commission 's social programme . </s>
I have already tell the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be hold in April between Parliament and the Commission , after the Lisbon conference , so that all aspect can be discuss and the social programme for @card@ can finally be draft . </s>
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of development , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme . </s>
but can you also provide confirmation concern the matter I raise in my question , namely that the programme will be design in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various type of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission be plan , as well as for those initiative which the Commission be plan with regard to dialogue between the two side of industry ? </s>
we need to see which concrete alternative the Commission will adopt during the come period and which initiative it will take for the purpose of reach agreement . </s>
firstly , I agree with you entirely . </s>
account will be take of the information society ; that be something which I too mention . </s>
social exclusion , the programme for woman , the effort we be make in the social protection area , everything need to be look at now in the light of the new reality of the information society . </s>
secondly , there will obviously be timetable for the initiative within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implement . </s>
where I can commit myself be on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , be not include in the article of the Treaty and there be no legal basis for social security question in the Treaty . </s>
since the author be not present , Question no @card@ lapse . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0819 / @card@ ) : subject : opportunity of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Eu under Article @card@ of the Amsterdam Treaty , it should be possible for all Eu citizen to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union . </s>
however , for people with various kind of physical disability who be in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement be still highly restrict . </s>
What measure be the Commission take to facilitate opportunity for the disabled in this area ? </s>
on @card@ November @card@ , the European Commission approve a package of measure to combat discrimination . </s>
as far as the package in question and people with special need be concern , there be a directive which concentrate on combat discrimination , especially in the workplace . </s>
the European Commission believe that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special need and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these person . </s>
of course , it be particularly important for people with special need to have access to mean of transport , service and all type of installation if they be to exercise their right to freedom of movement . </s>
the European Commission have approve a proposal for a directive on special arrangement in bus , coach and other vehicle , so that people with special need with mobility problem and people use wheelchair have access to them . </s>
in addition , you should know that , on 4 June @card@ , the Council approve the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduce for people with special need , the aim of which be to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organise parking area throughout Europe . </s>
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer . </s>
my question in the first place concern the opportunity the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe . </s>
it be quite an expensive business if you be to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you be in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage . </s>
I be grateful for the fact that the Commission have adopt an action plan . </s>
it be of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resource and mean of actually cross the border physically if you have a disability . </s>
it would be interesting to hear whether the Commission be also prepare to set aside financial resource for those who have disability , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchair take them . </s>
I refer to the directive which the Commission have propose on compulsory arrangement for mean of public transport , so that people with special need can use them . </s>
it have not yet be pass by the Council ; it be at the consultation stage . </s>
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be take at European level . </s>
I think it be exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programme for personal transport . </s>
that be deal with either under special programme in education , for young people , for woman and for exchange or must be a matter for national policy . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0006 / @card@ ) : subject : compliance with Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC concern the post of worker the post of worker directive have still not be implement in Denmark , even though the deadline have pass . </s>
the draft legislation before the Folketing do not contain any rule govern right of employ person under collective agreement . </s>
pursuant to Article 3 ( 8 ) of the Directive , term and condition of employment must be in keep with the ' collective agreement which have be conclude by the most representative employer ' and labour organisation at national level and which be apply throughout national territory ' . </s>
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope can be impose on the two side of industry without a legal basis . </s>
There be therefore two possible solution : either the Directive be inapplicable in Denmark , or Denmark be require by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreement . </s>
Can the Commission confirm that the directive concern the post of worker be inapplicable in Denmark as far as ' collective agreement ... declare universally applicable ' ( cf . </s>
article 3 ( 1 ) ) be concern , give that such universally applicable agreement do not exist under Danish law ? </s>
if not , will it explain how the directive be to be comply with in this area ? </s>
the European Union post of worker directive stipulate that the compulsory rule concern the term and condition of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to worker post to that country . </s>
What it say it that one of two thing may apply , i. e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreement which have be declare to be the rule universally applicable to a specific sector . </s>
because Denmark do not have a system for declare collective agreement to be universally applicable rule , provision must be make in the implement legislation so that , apart from current condition of employment stipulate in legislation , the hour in universally applicable collective agreement , conclude by the most representative organisation , also apply to post worker . </s>
in other word , to put it simply , Denmark have a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it . </s>
discussion be be hold between the European Commission and Denmark , and Denmark be expect to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation . </s>
the deadline by which it have to answer the Commission 's question expire on 6 December @card@ and we have not receive a reply . </s>
we be wait to see what the next move will be . </s>
thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation be correct - be that the post of worker directive entail an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreement . </s>
it be a very clear answer , but it be also an answer , may I point out , which put Danish organisation , the Danish government and the Danish Parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it be a well-known fact that there be a number of basic problem associate with the relationship between the Danish model , which be base quite obviously upon collective agreement , and the Continental model , which presuppose legislation . </s>
the disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer , Commissioner , concern , first and foremost , another directive , namely the work time directive , but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceeding loom because the Danish government do not intend , or have expressly state that it do not wish , to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreement . </s>
firstly , no attempt be be make to change the system in Denmark or in any other country . </s>
as I say earlier , there be always problem interpret the directive of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because system be very different from one country to another . </s>
as far as your question be concern , this problem do not only apply to Denmark . </s>
it be not only Denmark which have matter pend . </s>
Five country have transpose this into national legislation and the rest be at the discussion stage . </s>
What now need to be do , and this be the reason for the consultation and discussion between the Commission and the Danish government , and with other government , be to find the good way forward , so that something which be decide at European level by all the Member States , and which constitute a general framework , can also include worker post to Denmark from other country . </s>
and this be the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine government to move . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedication . </s>
you have fulfill your objective for today , which be to answer all the question . </s>
we congratulate you . </s>
since the time allocate to question to the Commission have elapse , Questions @card@ to @card@ will be reply to in writing . </s>
that conclude Question Time . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at @card@ p. m. ) @card@ discharge the next item be the report ( A5-0004 / @card@ ) by Mrs van der Laan , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European community for the @card@ financial year ( Section I - Parliament , II - Council , III - Commission , IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of auditor ) [ SEC ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0350 / @card@ , SEC ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0351 / @card@ , SEC ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0352 / @card@ ] the Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , be not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minute . </s>
nevertheless , I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur 's speech , from her office , if that be where she still be . </s>
Mr President , I be sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not be here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise . </s>
I would like to start by thank my colleague for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it be today without that spirit of cooperation . </s>
Mr President , early last year , the @card@ discharge be postpone because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resign Commission which could not enter into any commitment for the future . </s>
in its resolution , this Parliament state that discharge could not be grant until we have receive serious , far-reaching proposal for reform from the new European Commission . </s>
this report , therefore , appear at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock 's reform . </s>
it be an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reform to these plan . </s>
in the period lead up to this , it already appear , on the basis of the initial draft , that the Commission have make very important pledge . </s>
we ask for a whistle-blower 's regulation , and this be now in place . </s>
Parliament want financial inspection and audit function to be separate . </s>
this have now be do . </s>
Parliament require a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets . </s>
this be in place too . </s>
Parliament ask the Commission to waive its excessive privilege . </s>
it do this as well . </s>
the Commission have also enter into commitment to cooperate with Parliament in term of SEM @card@ . </s>
fundamental change will also be consider for the technical assistance office . </s>
these be sound , first step which illustrate that , if this Parliament so wish , change be not only possible but can also be translate into action quickly . </s>
we want more than that , however . </s>
the Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme . </s>
this be not only necessary for proper public administration , it be a conditio sine qua non of regain the trust of the European citizen . </s>
we now demand from the European Commission clear pledge concern the follow point . </s>
firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission document . </s>
this , however , presuppose that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive document . </s>
in the context of provide information , I would like to draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that we be very concern about the present draft plan on public access to document . </s>
if the current draft be correct , then this be a huge step backwards in comparison to today . </s>
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisation with representation in Brussels be able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen be not . </s>
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body hold the copyright to public document . </s>
we would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objection can more easily object to task which be unethical or unlawful . </s>
furthermore , it should be the case that , if the court of auditor detect a mistake not just one year but two year run , the management should be hold responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chance of promotion . </s>
ultimately , we also need to achieve good cooperation , of course , between the European court of auditor and its national counterpart . </s>
this Parliament have also ask the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reform on @card@ March of this year . </s>
it should no longer be the case that , although Europe be an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chip be down , we can offer effective aid to area which desperately need it . </s>
I would quote Gaza as an example . </s>
it be unacceptable that the Commission complete the construction of a hospital in @card@ and that , as yet , it have be leave unused . </s>
Mr President , since @card@ , the discharge have acquire a heavy , political significance . </s>
it be one of the most powerful weapon Parliament have and must therefore be deploy with care . </s>
this be why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow . </s>
however , we be not surrender this weapon without place a time bomb in its place . </s>
indeed , the @card@ discharge will not be give until all financial irregularity highlight by the court of auditor have be clear up . </s>
finally , this discharge report be naturally address to the Commission . </s>
but this do not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order . </s>
as long as we have no status , we be not credible as a force for reform the Union . </s>
the reform of the European institution be necessary in order to be able to continue Europe 's development process . </s>
we can have a decisive and fair Europe unless it be also open and democratic . </s>
all institution must now join force in order to work together towards build this type of Europe . </s>
Mr President , the Committee on Industry decide to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for @card@ although we be not specifically ask to do so . </s>
we go ahead because we feel we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that be , by make sure that we take good care of taxpayer ' money in Europe . </s>
during the course of our work on this report it become clear that there be persistent problem in the spending area under the control of our budget . </s>
they be not unique to @card@ and two strand seem to run through them . </s>
the first be a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programme , particularly in third country , without sufficient assessment of the practicality of implementation and proper resourcing . </s>
the second involve serious managerial shortcoming in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across department and management of external contract . </s>
I know that all the institution bear some responsibility for the increase workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resource . </s>
that can excuse everything that we come across . </s>
citizen of Europe expect the European institution to be properly manage and they be right to do so . </s>
that be why I want to echo the comment from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which have be promise to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock . </s>
from what I have see of the reform process , it look good . </s>
I see some of Mr Kinnock 's paper today , I hear some of what he have to say . </s>
I have every confidence that if we and the politician of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need . </s>
but we need that reform process . </s>
Many of the general point raise in our committee 's report have be cover in Mrs van der Laan 's report . </s>
it be an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it . </s>
it seem to hit on all the right point without just be like some of the old report , a series of detail . </s>
it group them together and that be very important . </s>
There be two issue I would like to draw your attention to . </s>
one be nuclear safety in Eastern Europe . </s>
we have to get this right . </s>
the Committee of Independent expert say the Commission be not manage this properly . </s>
we have to remedy that . </s>
the second point be about scrutiny mechanism . </s>
we need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending . </s>
we need proper information , give in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past . </s>
it have be see as a bureaucratic process to be do as quickly as possible in as little time as possible . </s>
I hope colleague in this House will support the ground for discharge for @card@ and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which be long overdue . </s>
only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restore . </s>
Mr President , Parliament now have to reach a decision , in plenary sit , on whether to grant the Commission the discharge for the @card@ financial year that be refuse on 4 May last year . </s>
therefore we must ask what have change , against a background that be truly historic as far as the Eu be concern . </s>
What improvement have there be ? </s>
What be there to justify grant the discharge today ? </s>
first of all there be - to some extent in any event - a new Commission . </s>
There have be a plethora of declaration of intent and announcement to do with reform , none of which have a great deal of substance to them . </s>
so far , no consideration have be give to create code of conduct for member of the Commission and their cabinet . </s>
I have take note of what Mrs Schreyer have to say this morning on the complaint against the two bank and the support for create protection under criminal law of the financial interest of the Eu . </s>
these be also positive sign . </s>
nevertheless , it have to be say that these will cost the Commission relatively little . </s>
the Commission have announce that it will present its reform programme in February @card@ . </s>
announcement and declaration of intent be one thing , fulfill promise quite another . </s>
however , the Commission 's endeavour can only be measure in term of actual result , for only in this way will it be possible to restore the enormous loss of confidence that the Eu have suffer amongst the citizen of Europe , on account of various shortcoming and machination . </s>
we have be able to take stock since May @card@ and our conclusion offer no compelling reason whatsoever for form a decision on the grant of discharge . </s>
if , nevertheless , discharge be grant to the Commission for the @card@ financial year , this then will mean that we will - once again - be give them a major vote of confidence . </s>
it be another story as to whether our citizen will have any sympathy at all for a renewed vote of confidence of this kind on the part of the democratically-elected monitoring institution that be Parliament , in view of the grave error commit by the previous Commission which be , of course , a millstone around the new Commission 's neck . </s>
in addition , and after all this be important as far as the general impression hold by the people be concern , there be the fact that so far - at least as far as I know - the court of auditor have be unable to deliver a positive statement of assurance since this instrument be introduce . </s>
nevertheless , I would advocate grant discharge for @card@ and also call upon my fellow MEPs to decide in favour , for , in so do , we would be set down a clear marker for a fresh start , as well as give the present Commission the opportunity to make a fresh start - which would also be apparent to the outside world - in term of cope with its admittedly onerous legacy . </s>
furthermore , this would entail continue to track down and resolve once and for all any irregularity or incidence of fraud . </s>
if the Commission be now to be grant discharge for @card@ , then under no circumstance should this be interpret to mean a clean bill of health for the past or carte blanche for poor financial management in the future , for it be know that friendship do not extend to money matter . </s>
this expression also hold true for the relationship between citizen and European institution . </s>
and friendship , which mean confidence in the reliability of the work of the European institution in this context , be something we have more need of today than ever before . </s>
it be , above all , the forthcoming enlargement of the Eu to include the state of Central and Eastern Europe that will produce far-reaching problem and impose burden on internal structure and administrative development . </s>
a Commission shake by financial scandal could very quickly become the pawn of certain interest and objective that most definitely do not feature in the Treaty of Amsterdam 's catalogue of aim . </s>
unfortunately , in the past , particularly in the year under review , problem have tend to arise in those assist area which be set to accrue great importance when enlargement take place ; for example the structural fund and the deployment of Technical Assistance office . </s>
we must put a stop to this unacceptable situation with all haste , for we can ask something of the new Member States that we can deliver ourselves ; nor do it help matter when the Commission and Member States point the finger at each other in turn and pass the buck from one to another . </s>
as rapporteur for the @card@ budget , I would like to give advance warn that , in the course of the next few week and month , I intend to keep a very close eye on how and whether the Commission implement its reform proposal and how it shape relation with Parliament in this very area . </s>
Mr President , I be sure the Commission will be relieve to hear that the @card@ discharge be unlikely to have the same impact as the @card@ discharge which , as you be all so very well aware , lead to the force resignation of the Santer Commission . </s>
the Socialist Group will be vote to grant discharge . </s>
I be sure you will be relieve to hear that as well . </s>
but that be not to say that we be satisfy , and that everything in the garden be rosy . </s>
it be clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission be long overdue . </s>
it indicate , however , that we acknowledge that step be be make in the right direction . </s>
I just want to outline some of the issue that we , as socialist , have put down as amendment . </s>
we hope these will be carry because they be important in the way that they will impact on future reform . </s>
first of all , the immunity of official : this should be lift if and when request by a national prosecutor . </s>
we need to make it much easy to prosecute official who be guilty of fraud and corruption . </s>
it be critical to note that the Commission have too often fail to act on the reform recommend by the court of auditor . </s>
the Court 's report be there for a reason , our response to it be there for a reason and it be important that it be follow through . </s>
I have just hear now that an audit progress board be go to be set up by the Commission . </s>
even if we hear nothing else , we know that be go in the right direction in term of the reform that we want to see . </s>
too often we have put forward recommendation and they have not be act upon even though you have say very often that you will act on them . </s>
we want to see that follow-through to a much great extent in future . </s>
the other issue be access to confidential document . </s>
we have have problem in the past in term of our responsibility in carry out discharge because we have not have access to the document we should have have . </s>
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we be give document we must ensure that confidential document will indeed be keep confidential . </s>
we have put down an amendment to that effect . </s>
One issue which be refer to in the van der Laan report be the whole question of the Gaza hospital . </s>
the situation there be totally unacceptable . </s>
we will not put up with it for much long and we be look for immediate action on that issue . </s>
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan . </s>
I do not usually bother congratulate people but I think she have produce a very cogent report and deserve our thank . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , if we be honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation . </s>
we be discuss last year 's discharge , but also the Commission 's responsibility . </s>
I would like to raise the problem which be still pile up high on our desk . </s>
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be grant also depend to some extent on where the emphasis be place . </s>
it be about a Commission which be no more . </s>
There be now a new Commission . </s>
then it be logical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be blame where @card@ be concern ? </s>
the problem remain and this give rise to doubt . </s>
we have to take a decision now regard the Commission 's good intention , but there be still no structural outline for these good intention . </s>
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month . </s>
we be all very much anticipate this , but the fact be still miss at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge . </s>
it be clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur have also struggle . </s>
this dilemma stretch beyond the area which I have already list . </s>
take , for example , the pledge make by the Commission . </s>
they look good in themselves . </s>
I have read a few document write by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them . </s>
but I will give two example from which it be not as evident that the good intention which the Commission have now express will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of document . </s>
the previous speaker already say something about this . </s>
a document be circulate at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhance the public nature of document , be have the opposite effect . </s>
this be an illustration of empty pledge not necessarily lead to good result . </s>
this also apply to whistle-blower . </s>
Mr Kinnock have also devote some fine-sounding phrase to this subject but , at the same time , it be entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happen with whistle-blower who want to get something off their chest and can do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament . </s>
we have still not have a response to crucial question of this type . </s>
so there be doubt as to whether these pledge of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decision need to be make . </s>
this also apply , for example , to the very real project which the Committee on Industry have introduce . </s>
in my opinion , the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intention and with sound plan on personnel policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who be now responsible for an area which have have serious shortcoming in the past should come with sound plan in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposal . </s>
at the moment , our group still feel sympathy for , and patience with , the Commission because it can be hold responsible for a large proportion of the mistake make in the past , but this patience have a limit . </s>
clear progress must be visible . </s>
at present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposal , but it be not a foregone conclusion that it will do so . </s>
finally , Mr President , the @card@ discharge be the beginning of the end of the last Commission . </s>
I express the hope that - in fact , I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the @card@ discharge be the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission . </s>
otherwise this discharge will not have be of any value . </s>
in assess the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be base upon what actually occur during the financial year concern , in this case in the course of @card@ . </s>
in our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for @card@ be in any crucial way well than that for @card@ . </s>
in that year , we vote against grant discharge . </s>
as a result , we shall vote against grant discharge for @card@ , too . </s>
we think that this picture of ours be confirm by the examination carry out by the court of auditor . </s>
it be both good and necessary that reform have be promise . </s>
so far , the promise which have be make be still , however , to be fulfill , especially where transparency be concern . </s>
we be therefore go to vote in favour of the demand for reform which be present in the resolution , but against the grant of discharge . </s>
Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comment to make on Mrs Van der Laan 's very expert work on this report . </s>
the Union for a Europe of Nations Group can vote for approve the account for @card@ . </s>
the report on so-called discharge contain a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the account . </s>
we support these critical remark , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approve the account . </s>
it have not be possible for the court of auditor to issue an auditor 's statement to the effect that the arrangement cover by the account be lawful , and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we , as member of this Parliament , be to vote in favour of account without have any guarantee of the legality of the arrangement concern . </s>
the majority have make their approval of the account conditional upon the new Commission be implement a series of reform , so as to ensure that what we be familiar with from the previous Commission 's period of office be not repeat . </s>
again , I must say that we be concern here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission 's accountability for @card@ and the new Commission 's accountability for the future . </s>
we do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstance , could incur liability for the past . </s>
we think it be wrong to talk about the Commission 's liability as an institution . </s>
the mistake up until @card@ be attributable to those who have responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of know whether the new Commission can do any well . </s>
by mean of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament be stop itself from place liability for the arrangement in @card@ squarely where it belong , namely with the previous Commission . </s>
it be the @card@ account which lead to the downfall of the previous Commission , and the @card@ account be just as incriminate . </s>
There be no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge . </s>
as far as the decision to balance the account be concern , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution be concern , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instruction contain in this and vote in favour of it . </s>
Mr President , the decision relate to discharge for the @card@ financial year be postpone because the erstwhile Commission , to whom it be to be grant , have step down before the appoint time and be only continue in office in a caretaker capacity . </s>
Mrs van der Laan 's report - on which she have lavish a great deal of hard work , and for which we be indebted to her - propose that we should grant discharge to the Commission for @card@ . </s>
one might ask how it be that the current commission be to receive the discharge for its predecessor 's budgetary management - Mr Camre just mention this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , @card@ , be deny . </s>
that be just the way thing be , however . </s>
in take over the mandate , the new Commission have to assume responsibility not just for the achievement of the past but also for the mistake make . </s>
since , on account of the college system , discharge can only be grant to the Commission as a whole or , alternatively , deny or postpone , it be no longer of any consequence that four former commissioner who belong to the previous Commission that have yet to be discharge , crop up again as member of this body . </s>
this question ought to have be ask when the new Commission be appoint . </s>
if Parliament vote in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control 's proposal this week and grant discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque . </s>
for it be the third section of Mrs van der Laan 's report that be the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution . </s>
the comment contain within , under eight heading , be an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which form the basis of our decision . </s>
in the course of the discharge procedure for the come year - that for @card@ be already under way - Parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it be too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for @card@ . </s>
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission present its reform programme . </s>
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for @card@ to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , be be display vis-à-vis the discharge authority . </s>
Mr President , Mrs van der Laan recommend that we grant discharge for the @card@ financial year , and we interpret this as an act of good faith towards the new Commission , as previous speaker have already say . </s>
this discharge be to be grant pend a commitment from the Commission to undertake sweeping reform ; that be what it say in recital 1 of the motion for a resolution . </s>
Anyone , however , who believe that , regardless of the fact that discharge be refuse for @card@ , the discharge for @card@ will make everything rosy in the garden again , be very much mistake ! </s>
as far as I be concern , the all-important question as to how willing the new Commission actually be to submit itself and its official to supervision by Parliament and the judiciary , have go unanswered . </s>
let me give you an example : one of the first issue we be confront with , as the newly-constituted Committee on Budgetary Control , be the Fléchard case , which involve fraud in connection with the export of butter to the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the ' 90s . </s>
on 7 January @card@ , high-ranking official in the Commission take the decision to largely waive the penalty which the company concern be actually due to pay and which amount to almost EUR @card@ million . </s>
this be an outright violation of Community regulation in force and the first we know of it be when an anonymous notice be send at the end of @card@ . </s>
Everything I have hear member of the Prodi Commission say on the subject hitherto boil down to a plea to stop poke around in thing that happen long ago and to look to the future instead . </s>
the enormity of it all be that a Director-General and a number of director who be involve at the time have declare themselves innocent of the fact that , unfortunately , the minute for the crucial meeting of 7 January @card@ have inexplicably disappear . </s>
it be claim that there be not just one copy of these minute , but rather that there be several copy . </s>
it be say that whilst each participant receive his or her own copy , sadly , none of these can now be find , none of them ! </s>
now , more than ever before , we can no longer say &quot; forget it ! </s>
&quot; this be something that should be on Olaf 's list of case relate to internal affair require investigation but , as far as I be aware , it still do not feature there . </s>
this be also one of those case that should be refer to the competent judicial authority since , when all be say and do , allow document and minute to disappear be no trivial offence but be expressly make a punishable offence in Article @card@ of the Belgian Criminal Code . </s>
all I can say be that we will no doubt take up this theme again during the discharge procedure for @card@ . </s>
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decide to postpone the discharge for the @card@ financial year pend commitment from the new European Commission regard internal reform . </s>
in response to this the Commission have enter into various commitment and have certainly adopt many reform measure . </s>
it be fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team be certainly commit to implement the financial control requirement as lay down by this Parliament . </s>
however , the reform of the European Commission must now be take in the context of the debate that be go to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various Eu policy and initiative . </s>
exist Eu treaty will be amend so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed . </s>
I have no doubt further reform of Eu institution will be analyse in this debate . </s>
but from the perspective of small Member States it be important that , as the European Commission be reform , it must be do in a way that ensure that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission . </s>
Mr President , the Commission be now to obtain its discharge for @card@ , but in reality it do not deserve it . </s>
@card@ be a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission do not think that it can accept liability . </s>
it be true that implementation of the Budget for @card@ fall within the old Commission 's remit . </s>
the new Commission have , on the other hand , undertake to carry out a clean up exercise follow former scandal , and I must admit that I be not impress at all . </s>
the old mindset which involve sweeping thing under the carpet and protect one 's friend unfortunately still exist . </s>
There be some who think that it be more in our interest to let bygone be bygone and make a fresh start . </s>
I do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy thing up properly . </s>
I be refer here especially to the early scandal involve Echo . </s>
I be very indignant about the fact that it be so difficult to get any document hand over on this matter . </s>
I be the rapporteur for Echo on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carry out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information . </s>
from the outside , it look as if the Commission have something to hide . </s>
my investigation also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case . </s>
the Commission be not put all its card on the table and be in that way repeat ancient practice on the part of the Commission . </s>
it be this practice which lead to the Commission 's downfall . </s>
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to document . </s>
otherwise , we can carry out our work . </s>
Mr President , rapporteur , lady and gentleman , I hope that I be able to answer the question as to whether we deserve to have the discharge grant in the affirmative . </s>
it be , of course , the discharge procedure for the budget , together with the report from the court of auditor , that act as a source of information for the tax payer of the European Union as to whether , and to what extent , budgetary fund be spend thriftily and in accordance with political priority , where error occur , but , above all , what kind of measure be be introduce to remedy the situation . </s>
the general public know that the European Parliament be not treat the discharge procedure as a routine matter but be give it every attention , and the Commission have also be aware of this since last year , when discharge be deny , which be what lead to the resignation of the previous Commission . </s>
therefore , today 's debate on the discharge of the @card@ budget signal the end of a long process . </s>
it have deal with virtually all the important issue that the Commission be concern with in the broad sense . </s>
Mrs van der Laan 's report address all these instrument . </s>
the report be very ambitious . </s>
it focus on the reform measure that be introduce and , above all , on those that will need to be introduce . </s>
the Commission share the rapporteur 's ambitious approach . </s>
I would like , Mrs van der Laan , to congratulate you on what be indeed a very ambitious report . </s>
I would now like to look more closely at a number of point contain in the report . </s>
firstly , the issue that rightly occupy a substantial amount of our time , that of externalisation of task . </s>
we have debate this at great length in committee and also in the framework of the budgetary procedure for the year @card@ . </s>
the Commission have promise Parliament that it will introduce measure in this regard in the very near future . </s>
foreign policy be the area that have most relevance to that of the Technical Assistance office . </s>
my fellow Commissioner , Mr Chris Patten , together with the other commissioner responsible for foreign policy , set up a review group , only at the end of last year , which be to undertake a very swift analysis of the task perform by the current Technical Assistance office and consider which of the task should be carry out in a different form in future . </s>
the group have undertake to submit specific foreign policy proposal shortly after submit the global reform package . </s>
the Commission be unlikely to be able to submit a detailed proposal on this specific point as early as @card@ March , but we hope to be able to do so very soon thereafter . </s>
you emphasise the global approach in your report . </s>
this global approach be part of the reform package . </s>
however , I also want to mention that concrete measure be be prepare which be in line with the report by Mr Bourlanges and which be specifically intend for this sphere of foreign policy . </s>
it be the aim of other demand in the report to increase transparency . </s>
again , I can assure you that , as such , you have pick up on one of the Commission 's reform objective . </s>
the Commission want openness and believe that it should only refuse your Chamber access to information where there be a need to preserve interest merit protection . </s>
I be confident that it will be possible to resolve these issue in the interinstitutional agreement . </s>
the Commission also intend to improve the information content of your account , above and beyond exist legal requirement , at your request and that of the court of auditor . </s>
I undertake , back in the debate on the court of auditor ' report , to take up this point , which also feature in this report - namely , carry out a systematic follow-up - because I consider it to be necessary . </s>
the Commission have already decide , on the basis of my submission , that the auditor be to take responsibility for look after the account , include those for @card@ , in such a way that they take on board the court of auditor ' criticism ; that be to say , advance payment be to be itemise separately , so as to keep this information to hand . </s>
the fight against fraud must be step up still further . </s>
we briefly discuss Olaf this morning . </s>
I would just like to again mention the staffing increase for which provision have be make in Budget @card@ . </s>
Mrs Stauner , the complaint I refer to this morning have not only just be announce , in fact it have already be submit . </s>
I believe this also testify to the fact that the Commission be not prepare to tolerate certain institution want to back out of this regulation , which be pass by Parliament and the Council , rather it apply equally to every single one of the institution of the European Community . </s>
finally , you call for dialogue to be improve ; more dialogue with the Member States about necessary improvement in those area where they have the power of decision over Community fund . </s>
I also second your demand on this point and will see to it that the Commission do what it can to have them implement . </s>
as far as the issue surround the Gaza hospital and the Palestinian Parliament be concern , I be able to tell you that the Gaza hospital will be open and available to out-patients as of @card@ July and to in-patient from @card@ October @card@ . </s>
secondly , the Commission will inform the European Parliament about the progress make in relation to the hospital and in relation to the selection of the consultant who be to prepare the invitation to tender for the construction of the Palestinian Parliament . </s>
All the reform measure I have mention be part of a global approach . </s>
Mr Kinnock be to present the global approach to you on behalf of the Commission and will talk about political priority of this period of office and enlarge upon the need for firm and , above all , verifiable and comprehensible scheduling . </s>
implementation of these plan should make the European Union and its institution , by and large , more powerful and transparent . </s>
Parliament 's task be to supervise the activity of the Commission , particularly within the framework of the discharge procedure . </s>
the Commission be very well aware of how resolutely and scrupulously the European Parliament be exercise this supervision . </s>
All the more reason for me to be please that the reform measure we have introduce meet with your approval and that you be prepare to form a positive judgement of the discharge procedure for @card@ . </s>
thank you , Commissioner Schreyer . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. M. Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent expert the next item be the report ( A5-0001 / @card@ ) by Mr van Hulten , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on action to be take on the second report of the Committee of Independent expert on reform of the Commission . </s>
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent expert chair by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegation of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission . </s>
on @card@ March the committee publish its first report conclude that : &quot; it be become difficult to find anyone who have even the slight sense of responsibility &quot; . </s>
within a few hour of the presentation of the report President Santer announce the resignation of his entire team . </s>
the resignation mark the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European commission mire in allegation of scandal . </s>
since then the Brussels landscape have change beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorate Parliament have be elect and a new Commission confirm in office . </s>
speak in this House on @card@ July president-designate Prodi undertake to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent expert on Commission reform , which contain @card@ detailed recommendation and which we be debate today . </s>
the new Commission have already take important step to move away from the way it use to function . </s>
a code of conduct for Commissioners and their private office have be adopt . </s>
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioner have voluntarily renounce their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer good . </s>
new rule have be draw up and implement govern the appointment of senior official . </s>
the number of department have be reduce . </s>
the Commission , in my opinion , have show a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they be to be congratulate . </s>
the overall aim of the reform must be to create a strong , honest European public administration equip to carry out its task in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which official be provide with the mean to carry out their task and be hold fully accountable at all level ; an administration that recognise and reward merit and encourage official to develop their full potential . </s>
in order to achieve this , action be require in four area . </s>
first , financial management and control within the Commission must be improve . </s>
One of the main problem be the lack of a function system of financial control . </s>
the Commission 's DGs must be make fully responsible for their own expenditure , include financial control . </s>
a new independent audit system service must be set up . </s>
DGs must publish their own annual account so as to enable a clear identification of problem area and set annual target for reduce fraud and irregularity . </s>
in return for this great degree of autonomy , manager must be make fully and personally responsible for their action . </s>
it be clear that the transition to such a new system will take time . </s>
change to the Financial regulation will be require and Parliament must have its say on those change . </s>
but while the Commission must ensure that it respect the Treaty and the Financial regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia . </s>
urgent change be require today . </s>
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthen , firstly by create a culture in which they can thrive . </s>
this require a clear example to be set by commissioner and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforce the exist mechanism for deal with fraud . </s>
Olaf , the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be place under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal court , criminal offence commit against the financial interest of the union by member and official of the European institution . </s>
a proposal can be make , a proposal should be make , on the basis of Article @card@ of the Treaty , by the middle of this year . </s>
third , standard in European public life must be uphold . </s>
the political crisis which lead to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrate the need for unambiguous and enforceable rule of conduct . </s>
a number of code have since be introduce . </s>
they must be assess by Parliament and should be make legally binding . </s>
the European institution should follow the example of a number of country , most notably the United Kingdom , and institute a committee for standard in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethic and rule of conduct in the European institution . </s>
whistle-blower who act in good faith must be protect . </s>
at the end of last year Mr Kinnock announce new measure for the protection of whistle-blower . </s>
they must be implement without delay . </s>
although such measure can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something go wrong . </s>
crucially , reform must not be limit to the Commission . </s>
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvement to its internal rule , administrative procedure and management practice . </s>
finally , the Commission 's human resource policy must be modernise . </s>
it be clearly no longer suit to the requirement of a modern , multinational organisation . </s>
the social dialogue have often act as a brake on reform and its overhaul be long overdue . </s>
a career with the European institution must become more attractive . </s>
too many young , new official be leave their job after just a few year . </s>
merit must be recognise and reward , specific skill training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a high grade . </s>
the promotion procedure must be make fair and more transparent . </s>
last but not least the pay and benefit package must be review . </s>
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market condition . </s>
it must be rid of some of its more outdated element ; and it must deal with the legitimate concern of the general public who can understand why European civil servant should be pay an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open border , or pay a level of taxis that be often well below that of Member States . </s>
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform . </s>
this communication must contain a clear timetable . </s>
with a new Commission and a new Parliament up and run the momentum for reform be now as strong as it ever have be and probably ever will be . </s>
enlargement of the Union be just a few year away . </s>
now be the time for Europe to put its own house in order ; to instil in its institution - as the independent expert might have say - a sense of responsibility . </s>
in June of last year Europe 's voter give a clear signal that they be feed up with endless storey about mismanagement and nepotism . </s>
There be a very simple way to deal with those storey . </s>
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism . </s>
Mr President , I do not want to be misunderstand - I sincerely hope this do not happen - and I should therefore like to start by say that I be , of course , in favour of combat fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reform . </s>
this be not a straightforward issue and call for a much more wide-ranging analysis , but I shall restrict myself to raise only a few point , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we be talk about . </s>
All the expert can provide information and news , formulate opinion and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so . </s>
I nevertheless believe that politician should look into what can be glean from an expert report and what can be take en masse in a spirit which , on some occasion , I have feel in the past and still feel to be self-destructive . </s>
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few idea - that Parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over its member . </s>
if this be not the case , the European Parliament 's authority and representativeness would be seriously undermine in the come year , and this institution would not move forward , as it should . </s>
it be just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committee any documentation . </s>
member of Parliament must possess the quality of morality , discipline and discretion over delegate issue innately , and these certainly can be impose on them by anyone else . </s>
I would point out that there be no European legal system , but that a different legal system exist in each Member State . </s>
we run the risk of delegate issue relate to the same offence which will then be punish in different way . </s>
I agree that an investigation system should be introduce , but I be also absolutely convince that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence . </s>
I be oppose to European Community official be accuse of criminal act at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing be a method that have no place in the third millennium . </s>
in conclusion , Mr President , Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reform which allow Parliament to grow and expand its power , not go into reverse . </s>
this debate on the van Hulten report bring to a close one of the most traumatic period for the European institution since their creation in @card@ . </s>
the refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the @card@ budget ; the motion of censure table in this House a year ago for differ reason ; and the first report of the Committee of Independent expert on the reform of the Commission which lead to the mass resignation of the Commission itself , be now part of European folklore . </s>
those of us involve in these historic event be well aware that none of the upheaval would have be cause have we not act with parliamentary power to press for change in the way in which the Commission operate . </s>
remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approve the @card@ discharge - not the @card@ - on the very day the Commission itself resign on @card@ March . </s>
now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent expert which we already have the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September . </s>
our great concern in the Epp be to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission be restore . </s>
further step to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European people perceive that there be no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous official . </s>
under no circumstance will we concede ground which we have win over the past few month , which we believe to be in the interest of openness and transparency . </s>
we be therefore concern to see the flurry of Commission announcement in recent week by Commissioner Kinnock suggest policy proposal of various kind to be put in a White Paper shortly . </s>
while convey a desire to proceed rapidly , it also give the impression that the Commission be in transmission rather than listen mode . </s>
our concern be strengthen if the rumour report a few day ago be true - namely that the Commission want to limit severely the access of Parliament to information . </s>
this be , after all , one of the cause of the downfall of the last Commission . </s>
have the lesson not be learn ? </s>
the knowledge that the framework relation between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiate lead to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debate his report in committee . </s>
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demean for Parliament to set out detailed instruction as to what we want the Commission to take up in its reform package . </s>
the less precise , Mr van Hulten , we be in our resolution , the more room it give the Commission and your former colleague in the Council to do what they like . </s>
we believe the vast number of recommendation of the Wise Men 's report should be implement . </s>
we have , as the EPP-ED group , submit all the recommendation of the Wise Men 's report in committee and many of them have now be put into the report , entirely change the nature of the van Hulten report in committee . </s>
we have resubmit a few amendment which fall in committee , in particular , our desire to see the code of conduct revise specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accept - when we have our hearing last September - should be include in these code of conduct , particularly when consider appointment and promotion . </s>
look to the future , we know that we be at the beginning of a long process of continue reform in the European Commission . </s>
we want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission official acknowledge in the outside world - a reputation that have be darken by the inappropriate conduct of a few individual . </s>
commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occur . </s>
in a nutshell : there be programme be run for which there be insufficient staff resource available . </s>
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing need of the Commission base on the essential activity for which it be responsible . </s>
our position be make very clear on this topic in the @card@ budget . </s>
we will be vigilant over the next five year to ensure the reform now be suggest be fully implement and will support effort make to modernise institution . </s>
but , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should step be take which do not correspond to the openness promise by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination . </s>
let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheaval by have an ongoing dialogue which assume from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in decide the outcome of Commission reform . </s>
Mr President , I must start by apologise that I can be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation . </s>
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report . </s>
it be an excellent report . </s>
it would have be wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that come from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issue . </s>
it be right for us to have a focus report which be what Mr van Hulten have produce . </s>
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse . </s>
yes , a lot of thing be lose by the Socialists but they have not be win in plenary yet , and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow . </s>
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his effort so far . </s>
he have be clear that his commitment have be to produce a radical change . </s>
central to this be the attempt to produce and engender responsibility . </s>
it be clear that this need to be develop at all level and it need to recognise the need of each level within the Commission . </s>
it be clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation . </s>
that be important . </s>
we need to stop people pass the buck from one to another . </s>
where failure be occur within the Commission we need to hold people responsible . </s>
we need to be assure that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal . </s>
this be natural elsewhere but it seem to be an extremely radical suggestion when it be put to the Commission . </s>
we can continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud be cost the European taxpayer money and provide them with a poor service . </s>
I will give you one example of this . </s>
in the @card@ court of auditor report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayer of Europe GBP 8 to @card@ million . </s>
it be clear that be not acceptable . </s>
What happen to the person who be responsible for that miscalculation ? </s>
we need a system which provide incentive and promotion and we need to see this promotion base on merit . </s>
we recognise that most of the official within the Commission be extremely hard-working . </s>
but we also recognise that some of the practice be outdate . </s>
we look forward to read the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to work out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Elles have just say , the Commissioner have make a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March . </s>
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouse should not throw stone . </s>
the European Parliament have not exactly be clean in its approach to thing throughout its history . </s>
we have a long way to go before we be perfect ourselves . </s>
our own staff policy be outdate . </s>
some of our working practice need radical reform . </s>
I hope that the European Parliament will be hang onto the coattail of the Commission in this reform process . </s>
we recognise the proposal on activity-based budgeting . </s>
we recognise that mean discipline on the part of Commission official and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priority . </s>
finally , can I say that the Commission need to work on its relationship with the public . </s>
European taxpayer need to be re-assured . </s>
the fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rest on delivery of this reform . </s>
that be the key issue , delivery of these proposal . </s>
Mr President , I would like to start by extend my compliment to the rapporteur , Mr van Hulten , on his first report . </s>
I very much admire him for keep his spirit up at a time when he be inundate with so many amendment . </s>
I think that the report draw up by the Wise Men have be useful and I think that it be also useful for this Parliament - as already state by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration be run . </s>
we have submit an amendment to this effect . </s>
from the many point make by Mr van Hulten in his report , I would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly . </s>
firstly , I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of document . </s>
the Commission 's record leave a great deal to be desire . </s>
we notice this when we have to investigate the Flechard affair , which , as it happen , have still not be sort out . </s>
curiously , very important document have go miss from the cabinet , even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General , and this be clearly something which should not happen . </s>
if Parliament want to carry out proper inspection , these document must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intend to do to improve this situation . </s>
I would also like to say a few word about ex post financial control . </s>
this have also be partly deal with in the van Hulten report . </s>
I think it would be useful if we be to give report figure per category and per sector on how the budget be implement . </s>
the general impression at present be that anything budget-related within Europe be bad . </s>
it be clear that , over the past couple of year , we have notice an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure . </s>
be this possible ? </s>
I would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reform have to be carry out . </s>
if we admit new Member States then we need to put our own house in order first . </s>
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten . </s>
it be his first report here in plenary . </s>
this be worth a compliment although I regret , of course , that he do not expound it in his own mother tongue . </s>
it be a report which come about with difficulty and may well be too late . </s>
in my opinion , this be mainly down to the wrangling between the two major group within our Committee on Budgetary Control . </s>
let us be honest . </s>
the second report of the Wise Men arrive in September . </s>
we be now four month down the line . </s>
meanwhile , Mr van Hulten have be inundate with amendment , more than @card@ amendment in the first round . </s>
he go back to work , rewrite his report and take into account the very many suggestion , but have to face nearly another @card@ amendment in the second round . </s>
my fear be that all of this have contribute to a report which be too detailed , too extensive and too late . </s>
moreover , I have be inform that the Commission have approve a report - today of all day - on the reform of the Commission which will be distribute for further consultation to the various institution and also to our Parliament , I hope . </s>
might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ? </s>
Mr van Hulten , my Group of the green and regionalist will support the attempt in tomorrow afternoon 's plenary meeting to embellish this report . </s>
after all , it make no sense to copy the many sound recommendation make by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report . </s>
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendment or against specific paragraph , this be certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable . </s>
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully back the recommendation make by the Committee of Wise Men . </s>
in any event , I look forward to the document which be approve by the Commission today . </s>
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February . </s>
I have to inform you , Commissioner , that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauge for our group , gauge which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not . </s>
I would like to end on the follow point . </s>
just as the White Paper on food safety be approve last week and release to public opinion with a clear deadline state , we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission . </s>
I think that there be a need for this , as public opinion be look for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of @card@ . </s>
Mr President , this report be positive but , actually , we need more than this . </s>
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere . </s>
they be most likely to occur if there be little democratic control on cash flow . </s>
via the structural fund , a great deal of the European budget be be pump around the system . </s>
this be only useful as long as there be a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poor Member States . </s>
but there be also funding which be be pump via Brussels back to the same rich Member States . </s>
district and regional authority consider this as their own money but they can only get their hand on this by invest vast amount of money and manpower in lobby and negotiate . </s>
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for strict control be more pronounced . </s>
even the strict control can solve this problem . </s>
it will , at good , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involve in choose and develop project . </s>
it would be preferable if national government channel this money directly to their local government without a European detour . </s>
in the next couple of year , we will need to think about the possibility of replace structural fund by an equalisation fund which be limit to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent region with a low income per capita of the population . </s>
this be probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less overhead , more transparency and more democracy . </s>
Mr President , a year have not yet pass , but it be already clear that Parliament be go to evaluate the first and second report differently . </s>
the first report be widely publicise , formally debate and use - just like the controversy and news leak which precede it - to make mincemeat , first of the President of the Commission , and then of the majority of the European commissioner , even though they have no connection with fraud , mismanagement or nepotism . </s>
read now what happen then , not even a year ago , it become clear that that first report be intend to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as be maintain today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provide much more salient point - be commission with the precise mandate not to address specific case , since there be no intention to follow up the offence detail in this report . </s>
it be of no concern to the major group in Parliament , nor to the majority of the trade union , who be busy discuss the defence of European public administration , but , in practice , be occupy with the corporate protection of their own member , put the wide power afford to them to dubious use . </s>
trade union representative sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee , thereby make it impossible to remove disloyal official and preserve the Staff regulation in their fossilise state . </s>
incomprehensibly , trade union representative be also member of committee on competition , and I would not be surprise if union member be already member of Olaf , thereby place this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk . </s>
I therefore understand why we be meet at this time , which be usually set aside for other activity and not for debate , discussion and the exchange of information . </s>
Mr President , in the van Hulten report , Parliament underline the harsh necessity for a thorough reform of financial administration . </s>
expenditure must be monitor much more closely , both within the Commission and the Member States . </s>
for this purpose , the European court of auditor and national court of auditor must work together more effectively . </s>
There be also the need to set up a scheme for so-called whistle-blower . </s>
we fully support all these recommendation . </s>
I would like to make some observation , however . </s>
One of the conclusion draw by the Committee of Wise Men be that the current legal framework for fight fraud at the expense of the European Union be incoherent and incomplete . </s>
How should we deal with this ? </s>
not by deprive the Member States of judicial power and transfer these to the European Public Prosecutor 's Office . </s>
this kind of procedure presuppose the existence of European criminal law and there be no such thing . </s>
moreover , this go to the very heart of the Member States ' sovereignty . </s>
we should therefore look to solve this problem by mean of improve cooperation between the Member States at judicial level . </s>
it could be coordinate by a kind of European Public Prosecutor who be not involve in prosecution but pass criminal offence on to the national legal authority . </s>
the Committee of Wise Men 's report also have some necessary point to make to the Council and Parliament . </s>
for example , the Council should attach far more importance to the Commission 's discharge procedure . </s>
also , Parliament should take up the gauntlet . </s>
it be high time that regulation be draw up for member and that travel expense be reimburse base on actual expense . </s>
the question arise as to whether Parliament be in fact prepare to find a way out of this impasse . </s>
this week , the Rothley opinion be discuss within the Legal Affairs Committee and there be nothing to indicate any such willingness . </s>
Mr President , when it come to put its own house in order , the European Commission be in a Catch-22 situation . </s>
There be enormous pressure of expectation follow the event that lead to the resignation of the previous Commission . </s>
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposal make here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive . </s>
There again , it be simply not possible to change situation once and for all with a few stroke of the pen , and the problem begin as soon as we have to start talk about implementation and get down to brass tack . </s>
this may explain why we experience more difficulty than anticipate in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regard this issue . </s>
nevertheless , the outcome be now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he have do on this report . </s>
provide this report be not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendment , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demand of the Commission on a number of crucial point . </s>
allow me to start with the most important demand . </s>
we do not want financial control to be abolish . </s>
the financial controller should still be able to make check before funding commitment or payment be make , not in every case , but wherever uncertainty or risk arise . </s>
the Commission be send out the wrong signal here , by rename the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits , for example . </s>
it may well be easy enough to change the Commission 's organisation chart but it be a different matter when it come to the legal text , particularly those relate to budgetary discipline . </s>
I do not have exact figure , but the Community 's budgetary discipline and the associated implement provision apply to almost @card@ different area of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the task assign to this office . </s>
this can be ignore or evade , certainly not on account of soft law , as be once suggest at a meeting of our Committee . </s>
irrespective of such legal consideration , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstance , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matter in the Commission be , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of function supervisory and investigatory mechanism . </s>
as we see it , there will be a dovetail of three mechanism in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also know as the audit service - which have yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularity by Olaf , the new anti-fraud office . </s>
it be to be welcome that Mr van Hulten 's report make the connection between all three area and also make it clear as to where the crucial shortcoming lie , which must be tackle . </s>
a few salient point : the disciplinary procedure be not take effect , especially when it come to call official to account for their misdemeanour , include those of a financial nature . </s>
There be a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanction be concern , and it be precisely in this area that the announcement make by the Commission be rather vague . </s>
I can only emphasise that these be the really hard nut that finally need to be crack . </s>
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van Hulten . </s>
it be a good feeling to be able to say that he be from our delegation and I be , I think , entitle to feel a little proud of him . </s>
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report . </s>
Mr President , the Commission 's resignation have also create a culture of fear amongst many official within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy . </s>
the call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seem to me a very fundamental one . </s>
I have witness from close up within the Development Committee how thousand of project stagnate and how sometimes up to @card@ % of the money be not spend . </s>
sometimes , an enormous reservoir of money be create , not because it be not desperately need , not because there be no sound proposal , but because the whole system have collapse . </s>
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending . </s>
it would be marvellous if this report be to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organise on that basis . </s>
when the Commission 's first draft report soon become the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change . </s>
without any doubt , this will then be a service , Mr President , to the European public and , by mean of the result we produce , we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lose over the past couple of year . </s>
this be the good support we can give to European democracy . </s>
if , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifty and cross over into the next century , we be witness a very special moment indeed . </s>
Mr President , first of all , congratulation to Michiel van Hulten for his first report . </s>
it be a baptism of fire but we have a say in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time . </s>
Mr van Hulten , I think you deserve a medal for your effort . </s>
There be two point which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR . </s>
firstly , there be the Commissioners ' individual responsibility . </s>
this must be regulate during the IGC . </s>
however , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hand of the Council and we have , therefore , submit an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reach between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and be not place our fate completely in the hand of the Council . </s>
secondly , as already mention by my colleague , Mr Mulder , the ELDR be of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigate by independent expert . </s>
this will contribute hugely towards re-establish the confidence of the European citizen in this institution . </s>
we at the European Parliament can be a credible counterpart to this reform Commission as long as we do not search our heart and put our own house in order as well . </s>
only when all European institution be reform will we have the open , democratic and decisive Europe which our citizen now finally deserve . </s>
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he be present to the House . </s>
I be sure that it will serve , amongst other thing , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up effort to find a consensus amongst the group . </s>
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reform the Commission , demand by our citizen . </s>
this Parliament have often hear the desire to reform the Commission express , even by its president . </s>
it now appear that this desire be more serious . </s>
after the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of expert have list an almost endless number of deficiency , it make sense that Mr Prodi should have promise , on @card@ September , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February . </s>
this Parliament anxiously await this complete reform programme . </s>
the report that we be debate today intend to give political force to many of the recommendation of the Committee of expert commission by this Parliament . </s>
Mr Prodi say he would act anyway , that he prefer to get thing right , but that fear of not get thing right would not prevent him from act . </s>
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it be , I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process . </s>
we want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense . </s>
commissioner should not be consider senior official but rather politician in office . </s>
therefore , the report allow them to be member of political party and to be member of political body affiliate to their party . </s>
perhaps the reference to the post be imprecise . </s>
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr Kinnock , but it be clear that we want commissioner who be politically strong and politically commit . </s>
we want a structure which allow every Euro to be spend effectively , and our account demonstrate that this be not happen at present . </s>
therefore , Commissioner , we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he have problem with those body who feel that their status quo be under threat , but not with this Parliament , which expect profound and daring change . </s>
Mr President , the Santer Commission come to grief because financial control fail all down the line . </s>
therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reform be swiftly undertake here and financial control be back in work order . </s>
as far as this be concern , a number of people have already refer to the fact that the Commission intend to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up check and that these check should be carry out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matter under the carpet in future . </s>
naturally , this be only to be welcome . </s>
What I do not understand be why this have to come at a price , as it be , that be , of have to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval . </s>
up until now , the Commission 's payment could only be make when the authorise officer sign the appropriate order and the financial controller give his approval in the form of a visa . </s>
and so it be the &quot; two key &quot; principle that apply here . </s>
a single key be to suffice in future . </s>
the financial controller be no longer to make advance check , if all go to plan as regard the reform currently under discussion within the Commission . </s>
if you will pardon me for say so , Mr Kinnock , what you be propose be a little like abolish the police because they be unable to prevent crime . </s>
What we really need to focus on , however , be make the check more effective . </s>
this could be achieve by no longer insist , in future , that the financial controller furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp . </s>
it be precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up control nothing at all . </s>
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that be , only in case of uncertainty or risk . </s>
the official responsible for financial control should be deploy on a decentralise basis , that be , in the operational Directorates-General , amongst those of their colleague that spend the money , so that they be immediately available when problem arise and so as to render the check less ponderous and time-consuming . </s>
however , the financial controller must work independently . </s>
that be the crucial difference between our plan and those of the Commission , when it talk in term of decentralisation . </s>
it be obviously the Commission 's intention to make the financial control official subordinate to the individual Directorates-General , but this be precisely what we do not want . </s>
surely we have learn this much from the event surround the Leonardo affair , when the internal examiner in the relevant Directorate-General issue warning , but these be neither heed nor pass on . </s>
therefore , independence be prerequisite for effective check . </s>
that be the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribe to . </s>
indeed , the new Commission have now declare itself in favour of follow-up check have this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ? </s>
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow 's vote . </s>
Mrs Theato have already express as much and I be only too willing to support her in this regard . </s>
Mr President , a couple of year ago , the previous Commission try once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structure . </s>
this lead to strike and smear campaign by intransigent trade union , whereupon the proposal be abandon and replace by a wishy-washy compromise . </s>
this be stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament be of no help on that occasion . </s>
when I read Mr van Hulten 's passage about personnel policy , I be afraid that Parliament may again be fail to tackle the crucial issue and just spout a lot of hot air . </s>
There be too many right , too many regulation and too little room for leadership . </s>
There be no backbone , and no tooth . </s>
where be the beef ? </s>
and I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it be British . </s>
Romano Prodi promise a revolution . </s>
you have say some powerful and worthwhile thing yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issue , the one where it hurt ! </s>
sort out the tangle of staff allowance . </s>
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it say here in the report , but as a management tool . </s>
ensure too , that training become a management tool . </s>
do not listen to the report 's demand that temporary staff should have their employment confirm . </s>
it be the post which should possibly be make permanent and not necessarily those employ on a temporary basis . </s>
finally , Mr President , as a member of the Bureau until six month ago , I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demand we be make on other . </s>
we have not do this so far , and this be something you ought to be instrumental in change . </s>
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I vote for it . </s>
so I refer to the thing I do not agree with . </s>
I do not agree with the paragraph in relation to Parliament . </s>
this report be about the Commission . </s>
Parliament be a separate subject . </s>
There be no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission . </s>
in addition to that , there be the question of duty-free . </s>
that be a stick use to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobby who resent the fact that the Commission abolish duty-free in airport . </s>
it be not worthy of be bring into this report either . </s>
most of the report be about financial control . </s>
that be reasonable because it come from the Budgetary Control Committee . </s>
but we should not create the impression that vast amount of European resource be be put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission . </s>
after all , it be only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending . </s>
we have have all that before but some people in this Parliament be young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resource of the European Union be and that @card@ % of these resource be spend by the Member States . </s>
so carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money be not likely to put at risk vast quantity of money . </s>
we should get it into perspective . </s>
it be important to remember that . </s>
the business of the European Commission be very little about spending money . </s>
they have very little of it . </s>
they have a much wide responsibility . </s>
that wide responsibility concern the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibility we have give them without the resource to deal with them . </s>
I be not one of the people who agree that there be a vast lack of trust . </s>
if there be , we have generate it in this House in the past year . </s>
I have be here for @card@ year and find absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament . </s>
we have have our problem and we recognise difficulty but there be not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission be mistrust , doubt and fear by the citizen of the European union because they be mismanage our affair . </s>
that be a gross exaggeration of what the difficulty be . </s>
this Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistake that cause the resignation of the Commission that go before it . </s>
while there be problem - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far . </s>
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report . </s>
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work . </s>
the process of reform have be go on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seem to prevail in the Commission . </s>
the Commission 's administration simply do not function particularly well . </s>
naturally , there be good , capable employee in the Commission , and they be in the majority . </s>
but we need radical reform . </s>
There be too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy . </s>
people should have clearly-defined power to take decision for which they should also be accountable . </s>
the Financial regulation should be amend . </s>
we agree that we should have good control of the finance . </s>
it be just a question of how . </s>
the Commission and the Committee of Independent expert be in favour of completely do away with ex ante financial control . </s>
we should be careful about this . </s>
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control . </s>
it be not enough simply to carry out spot check once the money have be spend . </s>
this would allow too many anomalous project to slip through . </s>
instead , we should be reform and decentralise control . </s>
the Commission do not have enough staff . </s>
as member of the European Parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our government and people back home that the Commission 's staff resource be not at all adequate for the task which have be assign to it . </s>
and the Commission should be able to refuse new task if it do not also get the extra staff it need . </s>
the staffing system be too rigid . </s>
There should be a more frequent rotation of employee , especially at the top of the hierarchy . </s>
it should also be much easy to sack inefficient and incompetent employee . </s>
I be therefore very please that the disciplinary procedure be to be reform . </s>
after all , the very bad experience so far with disciplinary proceeding show all too clearly how necessary it be that we carry out reform . </s>
Mr President , Commissioners , first of all , I can help but reflect upon the fact that this be , on the whole , a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speaker be concern . </s>
perhaps this be a little worrying . </s>
I hope , like so many other , that the state of emergency in relation between the Commission and Parliament be on the way to be resolve . </s>
we must get away from the idea that we be rush to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one . </s>
as Mr Blak say , we must instead establish a system with clear role . </s>
first of all , we need tough regulation , which can be implement . </s>
code of conduct and ethical committee be not enough . </s>
There need to be tough rule state , among other thing , what may be decentralise , what may be outsourced and what be independent . </s>
I find it a little worrying that people be clamour for independence in this debate without define what it be in relation to which there be to be independence and without define what right of decision-making be to be exercise . </s>
What we need , then , be basic administrative regulation for the Eu , for its institution and for the Eu in its relation with the Member States . </s>
these be what be miss . </s>
we have ask for a Public Prosecutor 's Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the Eu . </s>
we should make a good deal of progress if the Commission be to adopt , as binding regulation , the ombudsman 's proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice . </s>
the van Hulten report be a step in the right direction , but it be not enough . </s>
secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing role . </s>
the court of auditor be to monitor the extent to which action be incompatible with the regulation , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action . </s>
it be the European Parliament which be to carry out the political evaluation . </s>
we do not hunt down criminal . </s>
that be Olaf 's job . </s>
tell me what national parliament , for example , be hand all preliminary investigation document . </s>
obstinate as I be , I also want to say that the regulation govern public access to official record must be clearly good than the draft which have be circulate on the Internet . </s>
otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight . </s>
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report . </s>
I be please that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg have just do so . </s>
otherwise I probably would have feel slightly guilty about this . </s>
I would like to say that this report represent a huge improvement , also with its amendment . </s>
I be from the Social Committee and rapporteur on our committee be always proud to receive @card@ amendment because then they know that they have table an interesting topic . </s>
I think that this be also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talk about these @card@ amendment . </s>
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee be Mr Pomés Ruiz , who be Spanish and have hence make a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective . </s>
Mr President , one of the key aspect which have be mention be , to my mind , the rapporteur 's proposal for the stand committee on standard in public administration . </s>
a very important proposal indeed . </s>
I be only very surprise that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one table by Mrs Morgan , because she want to scrap it altogether . </s>
I can fully grasp the underlie rationale . </s>
on the one hand , we receive all kind of word of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , Mrs Morgan want to pursue a sort of scorch earth policy on this point and on other key point as well , as a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report vanish . </s>
I do not know whether this be to appease Mr Kinnock , but I happen to know Mr Kinnock . </s>
he be happy to hear what our demand be and be quite prepare to be flexible if he consider it necessary . </s>
in my opinion , such a far-reaching scorch earth policy be really unnecessary . </s>
finally , the issue of official . </s>
actually , I do not entirely share Mr Haarder 's view . </s>
I do agree that the section on official have , in fact , be complete totally inadequately . </s>
first of all , the importance of a public service in general be not at all emphasise . </s>
secondly , all kind of proposal be nevertheless be moot , and we have to ask ourselves whether these be terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement . </s>
for example , we be currently look into Taos . </s>
this be a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission . </s>
these two consideration be diametrically oppose to each other , and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table . </s>
Mr President , ever since Plato 's ' Republic ' , the Western world have regularly be tempt to replace government by the people with government by expert . </s>
our Parliament first ask expert to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they take advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be . </s>
in this second report , the expert have go a step further and criticise some of the political group in Parliament , which may have hesitate to remove the European commission from office , since they share the political affiliation of some of its member . </s>
the expert think that this problem will be resolve by ban the commissioner from belong to political group . </s>
accord to the expert , Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission . </s>
this task should be take over by a committee which will guarantee high standard in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elect , presumably make up of another group of expert . </s>
in this , their second report , the expert tell us that Italy be finance by the Cohesion Fund , that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-third of the structural fund and that the principle of additionality and complementarity in the structural fund come to the same thing . </s>
they tell us that the farming lobby be force us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only apply to the Commission and to the Member States . </s>
this lesson in wisdom be @card@ % ideology and 0 % knowledge . </s>
this will not help us to reform the European institution whilst fully respect democratic institution . </s>
the van Hulten report start out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieve . </s>
unfortunately , it be then change , and change for the bad , which turn it into a document which in fact , propose something that we can accept . </s>
Mr President , Mr van Hulten , your work be worthy of be qualify as enterprising , arduous and complex , and I believe this be important in a first report . </s>
please therefore accept what I be about to say as be criticism make in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be rich . </s>
this report seem to me to be redundant , long-winded , confused and lack in accuracy in the term use . </s>
perhaps ' redundant ' be the most serious epithet , and you be not responsible for this . </s>
it be the responsibility of this Parliament . </s>
that be to say , if this Parliament commission a Committee of expert - and I be not go to repeat what Mr Casaca have say , but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where be the sense in indulge in the medieval tradition of criticise the critic and so on , ad infinitum . </s>
clearly we be await this reform from the Commission , we be await the proposal which the Commission be go to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them . </s>
meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence . </s>
' Long-winded ' . </s>
I be not go to mention the length of this report . </s>
I do not know if it break the record for all the resolution present here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly do . </s>
I do not believe that there have ever be a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolution - which have have paragraph of more than @card@ line without a single full stop . </s>
it be also ' confuse ' . </s>
I be not go to return to what have be say about the analysis of question concern Parliament . </s>
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report . </s>
and finally , Mr President , frankly , I be not go to give example , but there be many case in which legal language be use with an alarming lack of accuracy . </s>
therefore - in summary - I await , and many of us await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which be the duty of this Parliament . </s>
Mr President , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposal for necessary reform measure show just how important these reform be . </s>
when one consider the event that have set these endeavour in motion though , it be only too clear as to why there be a need for them . </s>
hope and expectation be raise higher still by the strong message send out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control . </s>
the concept of transparency stand out in the report . </s>
secure this be a major priority . </s>
the importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work can possibly be emphasise enough . </s>
this be not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it be about show good will towards the citizen . </s>
we must win back their faith in Eu politics . </s>
the citizen demand rapid and open access to the institution and call for Eu provision to be comprehensible to them . </s>
this be what enable them to understand what be go on . </s>
they want to see the politics of success and believe that this be how any politically mature citizen could expect to be serve whether or not the reform succeed depend , to a very large extent , on the Commission 's own initiative . </s>
however , it annoy me when I hear today that the Commission be now say that it only wish to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis . </s>
however , Mr Kinnock , your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this come Tuesday must not just be a one-way street ; rather , as Parliamentarians , we want , and must , play a part in this and it also go against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference have take place this week , before we have have chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control . </s>
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieve on a personal level , the Commission still have quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectation . </s>
Can I begin by state for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal response on the report be not mine and not the Commission 's - it be the decision of this Parliament ! </s>
so if she have any lecture to offer they be well contain within this House . </s>
she know me well enough to understand that at all stage in the five year in which we work together in this House , there have never be a single occasion on which I have refuse to account in full , formally and in detail for everything I have do . </s>
Mr President , may I begin by pay tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in prepare his report . </s>
although new to this house he be relatively old in some respect , certainly in his familiarity with the institution as a former official - and I think that the value of that be show by his ability to tackle the complex subject which be of critical importance , as several member have say , to all of our institution . </s>
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative . </s>
Mr President , as you will know , Mr van Hulten 's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent expert be necessarily long and , since I want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issue relate to financial management and control , I seek your indulgence . </s>
naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the house than be absolutely necessary . </s>
when this House consider the second report of the Committee of expert last September , I pledge on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treat as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission 's reform proposal . </s>
our effort to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the house when consideration be give to the reform package that be adopt by the Commission today , well within the demand timetable that we set for ourselves four month ago . </s>
I be sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz be encourage by that . </s>
the great majority of the paper 's proposal be closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper include - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of action to be undertake in pursuit of reform . </s>
There be nothing therefore that be open-ended or vague about the report which I have have the honour to compile . </s>
the consider view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five week will for obvious reason be of great significance . </s>
I would say to Mr Elles that we be most definitely in listen mode . </s>
but he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I be sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we be propose , it be first necessary to transmit what we be propose . </s>
hence the transmission . </s>
though time forbid me , Mr President , from comment in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the detail will be treat as an important input into our reform proposal throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant area . </s>
turn to the main theme of the resolution I offer the follow observation . </s>
the need for transparency be rightly stress , not least because great transparency in the way in which the Commission operate will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission do . </s>
this be essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public . </s>
naturally , sensible safeguard be require to protect specially sensitive information , but the case where these be need should be keep to the minimum possible . </s>
I have repeatedly emphasise that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in @card@ or @card@ year of campaigning . </s>
that most certainly be the intention of the Commission . </s>
financial management and control be obviously a crucial area of reform . </s>
as the House know and have repeatedly say , the scale and scope of the Union 's financial intervention have grow immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedure . </s>
several member have make that point again in the course of today 's debate . </s>
we share the view , forcefully express by the Committee of Independent expert , and repeat in this draft resolution that the time have come for a thorough overhaul of our rule and procedure . </s>
the mean of do that be set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposal for a radical recast of the Financial Regulation in April . </s>
parliamentary support in pursue that essential course for change will be absolutely vital . </s>
I share the view express by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangement without a change in the law . </s>
change in the law be fundamental . </s>
There be preparation which can be make and they be specify and set out with the full reassurance in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation be obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system . </s>
essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralise system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control system within spending department so that Directors-General be well equip to take responsibility for decision with an impact on the European Union budget . </s>
in addition , and to achieve good assurance than those provide under the present system , the new system of decentralise control must be complement by set up an internal audit service - &quot; the second key &quot; as Herr Bösch say , establish in a way that be closely consistent with the recommendation of the Committee of expert . </s>
that service will open on 1 May this year . </s>
it will be head by a professionally qualify member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guarantee through a new provision to be add in the financial regulation . </s>
the new service will report to me and it will be accompany by an Audit Progress Board chair by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I be delight to see in the Chamber this evening . </s>
as Budgets Commissioner , here responsibility already include relation with the court of auditor . </s>
this Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits . </s>
I want to emphasise strongly that change our control system will definitely not mean relax them . </s>
the propose change will make the system more effective , both in term of input and in term of measured and accountable outcome . </s>
I can also specifically assure the house that we be not go for what be sometimes call &quot; a big bang approach &quot; . </s>
financial control 's ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquish as and when the internal control system in a department be show to be fully adequate . </s>
I be somewhat surprise that paragraph @card@ of the draft resolution do not appear to address the fundamental criticism of the current centralise financial control function make in both report of the Committee of Independent expert . </s>
that committee be very clear about the need to abolish the centralise ex ante visa . </s>
it be clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control . </s>
in addition , I do not believe that paragraph @card@ fully reflect the opinion of the court of auditor in @card@ . </s>
naturally the Court will be able to give its consider opinion on the propose change to the Financial Regulation but it be useful to recall Mr Karlsson 's comment to this House last month . </s>
&quot; the Commission 's internal control &quot; he say &quot; be not forceful enough in prevent incorrect operation . </s>
for instance , the Financial Controller grant a positive a priori visa in most of the case of mismanagement or irregularity recently uncover . </s>
at the same time , the internal audit function be carry out in an uncoordinated way by several body , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some unit operate Directorates-General . </s>
&quot; the centralise ex ante approval system be doubtlessly originally design to ensure carefulness but , over the year , it have have the perverse effect of reduce the extent to which manager feel responsible for their decision . </s>
I do not believe that there be any real disagreement between us on this . </s>
I take it from paragraph @card@ that the underlie preoccupation of honourable member be that there should be a carefully manage transition . </s>
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable member will see when they read the reform strategy document . </s>
our objective , the committee 's objective , the Court of auditor ' objective be not to abolish financial control , it be to get rid of and improve upon centralise financial control . </s>
before leave this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintain pend the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of month . </s>
turn quickly to the section of the resolution on fight fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concern report by Commission official of perceive wrong-doing . </s>
as I make clear in the hearing last September and on other occasion , we be at one in the belief that there be value in define the well possible mechanism for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be need . </s>
since June of last year , the Olaf regulation have give good guidance to staff about report possible irregularity . </s>
we propose to complement those provision by define the right and obligation for official to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channel but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line . </s>
the possibility of use specified external channel will also be address . </s>
we be seek to implement good practice . </s>
serious response to report , confidentiality at early stage and career protection will be assure for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in way that do not compromise investigation by untimely disclosure . </s>
as a corollary , there will be safeguard for official who be the subject of false allegation . </s>
a communication later this year will give full detail . </s>
I do not think Parliament will be disappoint by what we will propose . </s>
I be persuade , however , by the suggestion in paragraph @card@ of the report on use external body to enforce exist provision on financial liability . </s>
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedure to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism . </s>
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament . </s>
a communication in June will set out the full proposal for change . </s>
standard in public life be the next main section of the report before the House . </s>
with the introduction of a series of code of conduct the current Commission have begin to develop an explicit ethical framework . </s>
this will be take a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standard in public life . </s>
that be in line with the draft resolution . </s>
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethic and standard and to supervise common and separate code of conduct for the institution . </s>
I welcome Parliament 's support for that . </s>
we be also currently examine how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for document , make in paragraph @card@ of Mr van Hulten 's report . </s>
the draft resolution rightly recall the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament . </s>
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleague have demonstrate the Commission 's practical commitment to that . </s>
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relation between our institution which will include update rule on access to document . </s>
the point be very properly raise by Mr Elles and refer to by Mrs Thors . </s>
I be sure they be aware that in mid-December we officially receive the draft framework agreement with Parliament . </s>
we be now wait for Parliament to decide when it wish to begin negotiation on the text . </s>
we be very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible . </s>
the report rightly emphasise the central importance that human resource policy must have in reform . </s>
I be glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendation on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management position be very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposal . </s>
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system be no longer adapt to the need of our institution . </s>
it certainly block the advance and mobility of people with proven capability . </s>
member , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praise Commission official , who in the great majority and typically be of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , be absolutely right in the comment that they have make . </s>
while the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our idea on these and other point , detail and precision be obviously essential . </s>
a series of communication will therefore follow in the come month . </s>
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House . </s>
it be , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matter of common interest , notably pay and pension and the revision of the staff regulation . </s>
on this latter point we be reflect on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which make common provision on lead issue like pay , condition , staff representation right and so on , but enable the different institution to operate implement rule on other matter . </s>
the early thought of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome . </s>
I conclude by refer to paragraph @card@ of the resolution before the House relate to the resource requirement of our policy for change . </s>
that be most certainly relevant . </s>
we be sure that there will be an important &quot; reform dividend &quot; as the modernisation measure begin to foster increase efficiency and good management in the use of resource . </s>
it be very clear , however , that part of the Commission service be already very stretch . </s>
Parliament have frequently make that point . </s>
secondly , it be also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skill and in technology . </s>
thirdly , it be very clear that increase preparation for enlargement must be undertake . </s>
they be already have implication for resource availability . </s>
it be also clear that if we take on new task - which we will surely be ask to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called &quot; negative priority &quot; and drop those negative priority in order to create spare capacity . </s>
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tie the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management . </s>
I want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduce by the Commission , it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demand make on the Commission . </s>
the Commission therefore welcome paragraph @card@ of Mr van Hulten 's report . </s>
I conclude , Mr President , by thank the house for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by express sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committee which give their opinion . </s>
we look forward to work closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , work together with this House on its implementation continually through the year that will be require on such complexity . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. ( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) Middle East peace process ( continuation ) the next item be the continuation of the Council and Commission statement on the Middle East peace process . </s>
I be very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hear some of Minister Gama 's insight , as he arrive hot-foot from the region . </s>
my only regret be that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday mean that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East , even though , as I mention earlier in the day - which be another story - event conspire to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki . </s>
such be life . </s>
I hope that honourable member will excuse me if I be not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would , in all normal circumstance , wish to do . </s>
the debate be fix for this morning and on that basis I have arrange to see visitor from the Balkans this evening . </s>
so I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion . </s>
it be not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of . </s>
like honourable member , I welcome the United States ' effort that have relaunch the Syrian / Israeli negotiation , despite the Syrian decision that they need more time before resume the talk that be schedule to start again today . </s>
There be reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be build in the near future . </s>
I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese / Israeli talk which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel 's relation with its northern neighbour . </s>
at the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track . </s>
the situation of the Palestinians have always be the core issue of the conflict . </s>
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remain the key to lasting peace in the Middle East . </s>
Israelis and Palestinians have make substantial progress in implement the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum . </s>
although there have be some slippage , I trust that the remain Israeli troop redeployment will materialise soon . </s>
similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework agreement on permanent status have be push beyond the mid-February deadline , I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reach . </s>
I be reassure that this be also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat , when they meet on Monday . </s>
Honourable member will know that one particular concern of ours have be that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track . </s>
this be far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsor as well as the regional party . </s>
we be charge with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development . </s>
the beginning of the talk with Syria pave the way for a convene of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month . </s>
I look forward to attend that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push thing forward again . </s>
the European Union have an important role to play in the peace process , as all side - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbour and the United States - have acknowledge . </s>
nor be our role confine to that of banker . </s>
we must be prepare to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region . </s>
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive Middle East peace deal come with a hefty price tag . </s>
the Commission be already consider the implication for the European union of the recent encouraging development . </s>
we intend to share our more detailed thought on the matter with Parliament and Council soon . </s>
but let me remind honourable member that the European Union be no slouch when it come to financial support for the peace process . </s>
we be the large of all donor to the Palestinians . </s>
we have also offer very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt . </s>
with the Israelis we have establish close cooperation in a number of area of particular interest to them . </s>
the Community contribution of over EUR @card@ million in grant and loan between @card@ and @card@ effectively underpin the Palestinian authority and contribute substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza . </s>
European Union Member States together contribute another EUR @card@ million during that crucial period . </s>
in this context , let me applaud the important step that the Palestinian authority have recently take to improve budgetary transparency . </s>
President Arafat will be meet the Council of Ministers next week . </s>
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous step to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law . </s>
the Commission be actively involve in those effort . </s>
the Commission have also step up its planned support for regional cooperation project between Israelis and Arabs . </s>
we commit more than EUR @card@ million for such project last year . </s>
this package include renewed assistance for people-to-people activity and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert level . </s>
member will recall that the European Union be the large financial donor to the overall effort in bring reconciliation to the people of the Middle East . </s>
a number of issue naturally emerge as additional potential target of Community support in the come phase of the peace process - among them , help to consolidate a Golan settlement both in term of contribute to security arrangement and support demining and the rebuilding of community in the Golan Heights . </s>
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy . </s>
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon , the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable effort . </s>
we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole . </s>
a solution be need to the Palestinian refugee problem - these be the large group of refugee in the world , number nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenge ahead . </s>
we must support initiative increase the availability and improve the distribution and management of the region be very scarce water resource . </s>
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we be encourage closer regional cooperation in a number of area , bring all the country concern together in a joint endeavour to address their common problem . </s>
it be already apparent that the financial resource currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be require in the event of permanent peace . </s>
I want to underline that point . </s>
I wish insistently to remind the Council and , should it be necessary , Parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we be actually capable of do . </s>
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be ask and expect to provide . </s>
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that . </s>
we have make progress in recent month and week , as Mr Gama mention earlier . </s>
but it be inevitably go to be a tough process with difficulty and disappointment on the way . </s>
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligation and challenge that will be create by that outcome . </s>
lastly , I will repeat for some who have enter the Chamber in the last few minute , what I say at the outset of my remark : that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of have assume that the debate be take place this morning and have fix a meeting on the Balkans for this evening . </s>
I hope the House will understand that . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Patten have our understanding . </s>
I would like to tell him that communication with Madrid be usually more fluid and , therefore , I hope to see him there soon . </s>
the statement we have hear today on the Middle East peace process be very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - have make of the region , accompany by other Council representative . </s>
the tone of the news in the medium on the recent event in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation . </s>
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation . </s>
in this sense , I share Commissioner Patten 's positive attitude . </s>
let me explain : it be true that the Israeli government have delay the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authority . </s>
it be also true , however , that , since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement , @card@ % of the territory of the West Bank have be hand over to the Palestinian National Authority , together with two third of the Gaza Strip and , more importantly , this agreement have so far be scrupulously comply with , since , under the term lay down in Sharm el-Sheikh , the Israeli government have the right to delay that handover . </s>
this be naturally on the condition that the delay do not exceed three week , as Prime Minister Barak have promise . </s>
on the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talk , initiate in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic , be undoubtedly significant , but I be convince that the hope which be raise on 3 January in that town will not be dash . </s>
Mr President , the fact that the different group in this Parliament be table a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which be the result of a broad consensus , seem to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace process . </s>
I would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve difference , which be still no doubt profound , between the party . </s>
in my judgement , this constitute a guarantee to both side , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the European union in term of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for . </s>
it be clear to everyone that this be essential to guarantee security in the area and to cooperate in the development which be need to heal the serious social difference which exist . </s>
but this also serve to make a claim , on the part of the European Union , for a degree of political participation in the process which be consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspiration to be banker - and which will be suitably visible to the public . </s>
There be absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this . </s>
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account . </s>
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo 's speech set here . </s>
we in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process . </s>
it be , of course , a peace process which be finally under way . </s>
if we think of how the process be look a year ago , the difference between then and now be like that between night and day , despite difficulty and delay . </s>
I want to emphasise four point . </s>
first of all , the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contain , as everyone know , a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel 's commitment . </s>
this apply both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements . </s>
while the negotiation on the final peace settlement have begin , I think it be important to keep the two process apart . </s>
a lack of progress in the final status negotiation should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreement . </s>
What we need to look out for in this context be how matter develop in connection with the harbour in Gaza , the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank , further release of political prisoner and implementation of the financial commitment . </s>
the second point relate to Syria . </s>
there , the border question be obviously central . </s>
How negotiation be proceed there , we still do not know . </s>
What be important , however , be that they have begin . </s>
an important question in this context be the future distribution of water . </s>
as thing be at present , the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel 's water supply . </s>
the third aspect be the peace negotiation in Syria which be closely link to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon . </s>
accord to UNIFIL , there be now concrete sign that Israel be prepare to withdraw , which be something we welcome . </s>
There too , of course , outstanding matter in dispute be the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugee . </s>
my last point concern the future Palestinian state . </s>
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without Israel 's support . </s>
the Barak government have give to understand that it intend to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party . </s>
even if negotiation be not complete by September of this year , there be nothing in the relevant treaty to prevent a Palestinian state from be proclaimed after that date . </s>
in this context , it be important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten say , namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state . </s>
this be something to which we all want to contribute . </s>
Mr President , I would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be lay down to round off this debate . </s>
My Group have make a contribution to this resolution and , needless to say , approve of it . </s>
more specifically , however , I would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , Israel and Syria be on speak term again to resolve their difference of opinion . </s>
the recent negotiation be already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East . </s>
it be , therefore , regrettable that these peace talk have be suspend for the time be . </s>
indeed , both party will need to make huge effort . </s>
lasting peace in the region can only be achieve by mean of an agreement which guarantee the security of the Israeli border , as well as Syria 's integrity . </s>
it be also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relation and to establish constant dialogue . </s>
in addition to the bilateral meeting with Syria , I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiation with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible . </s>
nevertheless , it be still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donor , be still unable to play a major political role in the peace process . </s>
this peace process in the Middle East be one of the priority of the European Union 's common foreign and security policy . </s>
this be where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own . </s>
the Commission and Member States also have to be encourage to support project which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nation in the region . </s>
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation . </s>
in this respect , we support Libya 's participation , provide that it recognise human right , renounce support for terrorist and fully support the peace process . </s>
There be still , needless to say , many unresolved problem and unanswered question , also involve the Palestinians . </s>
Everyone know that the peace process be a protracted and difficult affair but we be convince that , with the necessary trust , perseverance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East , will be achieve . </s>
Mr President , it be pleasing that , despite certain delay and problem , the peace negotiation be go on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria . </s>
the moment of truth be approach . </s>
be Israel prepare to comply with the UN 's resolution and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the Arab area which be conquer in @card@ ? </s>
Will Israel let Palestinian refugee return or be give compensation ? </s>
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ? </s>
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ? </s>
Will Syria fully accept Israel 's existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ? </s>
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lie with the occupying country , Israel , do not prevent the Arab partner from also have a considerable share of the responsibility . </s>
peace in the Middle East concern us all , however . </s>
it be therefore good that the Eu should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state . </s>
against this background , I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler 's extermination of the Jews be be hold , which be obviously a welcome initiative . </s>
of @card@ state invite from all corner of the world , not one of them , however , be an Arab state include in the Eu 's Barcelona process . </s>
this have be interpret as indicate that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regard by European as be similar to the Nazis ' anti-Semitism , which of course be completely incorrect . </s>
the Arab world 's criticism of Israel have be found upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , Algeria 's fight for freedom against France . </s>
but today , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine have peace treaty with Israel . </s>
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten do not agree with me that it would have be only right and proper to have invite at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he have demonstrate of the difficulty inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union be take on to bring it to completion . </s>
it be high time there be peace in the Middle East . </s>
it be time to end the era which begin with the Balfour declaration in @card@ and the Arab-Israeli war of @card@ . </s>
it be time there be secure border and political , social and economic right in every country in this region , and that human right be recognise and uphold in Syria , Palestine , Israel and everywhere else . </s>
this be an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it be vital for all party in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and right , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concession must be give . </s>
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question , but the same also apply to the territory which have be occupy in the Golan since @card@ and in southern Lebanon since @card@ . </s>
Israel have to accept its responsibility , withdraw from the occupied territory and share its water resource but , at the same time , it have to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in term of economic and political relation with all the country in the area . </s>
however , Israel be not the only country concern with security . </s>
the same go for the other country , especially for the Palestinians , who be still live under military occupation and whose land even today be still confiscate in area B and C , despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreement . </s>
between the period when the Oslo Agreement be sign and @card@ October @card@ , @card@ @card@ dunams of land be confiscate , 8 @card@ of which have be take under Mr Barak 's government . </s>
tree have be uproot , house be still be demolish and , above all , water supply have be reduce or refuse , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlement continue and be grow constantly . </s>
nevertheless , there be no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive step have be take : negotiation , at least , have resume . </s>
but in the Middle East , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state , if they can move freely within their own territory . </s>
All the international community have to do be implement Resolutions @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
we be concern by the deferment of the building of relation with Syria , as well as Mr Barak 's decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el ­ -Sheikh agreement . </s>
we feel it be extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiation which match its economic aid . </s>
we can be content with a role backstage . </s>
we must be lead protagonist while stay off a collision course with the United States , as Minister Gama say . </s>
Mr President , firstly my thank and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comment here today , particularly in relation to the role of the European union in the peace process , and for reaffirm that our role be not only that of &quot; banker &quot; for the entire operation . </s>
I be deeply disappoint at the news this week that the peace talk between Israel and Syria have be suspend . </s>
I very much hope that a compromise can be reach to overcome this so that the peace negotiation can be resume at a very early date . </s>
nevertheless , we can deny that some positive political progress have be make in the Middle East of late . </s>
the fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister be recently sit around the same table in America for the first time in their respective history be an indication that old hatred and animosity can be overcome . </s>
political leader must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East . </s>
I know that if agreement can be reach between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum . </s>
the settler at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensate and there will have to be guarantee of security . </s>
if Syria would be willing to offer concession on the security question then the prospect of a successful resolution to the Israel / Syria question might be promising . </s>
on the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there be still some difficulty with regard to the implementation of some aspect of the Wye Agreement . </s>
the key problem area at the moment include the difficulty of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territory . </s>
the low level of release of Palestinian prisoner and the fact that the Israeli government appear to intend halt implementation of building permit already grant , as well as not approve new one , pose further obstacle . </s>
these issue have clearly be hold up progress on the permanent status negotiation , although , I believe , these talk will not be hold up indefinitely . </s>
at present , the main difficulty in approach the negotiation seem to be that the Palestinians be insist that the border issue must be agree upon first , while the Israeli government say that it should be settle only if a solution be reach on the issue of settlement and security . </s>
currently , both side seem to have accept that nothing will be agree until everything be agree . </s>
in conclusion , while other country in the Middle East have have reservation about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian government have be bring into the peace process , Egypt and other country in the region be willing to move forward . </s>
I sincerely hope that , in the interest of improve the safety and quality of life of the people live in the Middle East , all the key protagonist will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matter which need to be resolve . </s>
Mr President , the various motion for resolution table in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East . </s>
There be those who be in favour of new agreement between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue . </s>
indeed , the time have come to resolve a central problem for global stability . </s>
the time have come for Israel to fulfil its promise of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territory , at last recognise once and for all the authority of Palestine , whose resume diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it be under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat . </s>
it be equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question , which no one discuss anymore , thereby relegate the problem of million of woman , elderly people and child , the victim of an embargo as arrogant as it be wicked , to oblivion . </s>
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality , but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it be time that it attach the same importance to people ' life as it do to the ballast of the cold , colourless , artificial neon bulb in our lamp , which can illuminate house but not the world in the third millennium . </s>
Mr President , the Israeli author , Amos Oz , manage to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiate table between the Israelis and Syrian recently . </s>
he be under the impression that the Syrian think that , in exchange for the Golan Heights , all they have to do be to fax the Israelis a receipt . </s>
Oz 's impression be also echo in the Israeli press . </s>
it contrast Prime Minister Barak 's personal peace effort and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of Damascus , President Assad , at the negotiation in the United States . </s>
surely Assad would be Barak 's ideal negotiate partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister . </s>
and the Israelis be certainly not impress by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown . </s>
his behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak be plainly insulting . </s>
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic nicety in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ? </s>
well , the Syrian be quite possibly cut off their nose to spite their face . </s>
at the end of the day , Israeli voter can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan . </s>
All the resolution submit express the sincere wish for great European involvement in the peace process . </s>
it be , however , very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billion of dollar which the Israeli and Syrian authority require from their peace patron , the United States , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantee in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan . </s>
I would like to finish off by ask the European Council and Commission a question . </s>
How accurate be the press report which state that the Portuguese Presidency have already pledge troop as a peacekeepe force in the Golan ? </s>
Mr President , the truth be that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talk between Syria and Israel be not good news , but nor be it good news that the day before yesterday there be another bomb attack which injure @card@ people . </s>
it be clear that , for once , the United States have not be able to secure progress on the restart of these negotiation , and it be true that the obstacle be difficult to overcome : the Syrian wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the border which exist before 4 June @card@ , while the Israelis wish , since they consider that it suit their situation well , to have the border which be set in @card@ . </s>
the suspension of the talk between Syria and Israel be not the only delay affect the peace process in the Middle East . </s>
the application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authority and Israel be also suspend at the moment . </s>
after the talk which take place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority , the Israeli Prime Minister request a delay of two month as from @card@ February , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . </s>
What can the European Union do in these circumstance ? </s>
unfortunately , very little . </s>
it naturally have to support these negotiation , sponsor by the United States ; contact have to be increase ; the presence of the European Union envoy , Ambassador Moratinos , who have fulfill his mission with great diligence and efficiency , within the power of the European Union , be positive . </s>
but none of this hide the fact that there be a certain sense of impotence , because when the negotiator from each side fly back to the United States this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every @card@ dollar spend on the peace process in the region , @card@ be contribute by the European Union . </s>
when we consider that a conference will soon be hold in Moscow , it become clear that the European Union 's presence in this peace process be somewhat pitiful . </s>
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a great role , that it be time to take over and to secure great participation for the European union in this process . </s>
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region , as well as the president of the relevant interparliamentary delegation , will begin an era of great initiative and a great presence for the European union in this complicated and difficult peace process . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , I should like to thank you for your statement , especially Commissioner Patten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not , therefore , repeat any of his idea . </s>
I should just like to make three comment which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reason , a Member can formulate more openly . </s>
first , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authority . </s>
but we have enough agreement now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh . </s>
we have enough agreement ; they just need to be implement . </s>
however , in this regard I share Mr Salafranca 's scepticism when he say that there have be bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum can be implement within the set timeframe . </s>
my second point concern the resumption of negotiation between Syria and Israel . </s>
I consider this to be very encouraging news . </s>
but we have also learn this week that Mr Barak will not be travel to Washington and that the negotiation can therefore be continue . </s>
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Golan Heights be return to Syria , the problem in this region will be solve . </s>
on the question of the referendum which various member have refer to : we must consider if a referendum always need to be hold in order to honour obligation under international law and under the law of nation . </s>
in Germany , there would probably be dance in the street if we be to say that we be hold a referendum on payment to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people be prepare to pay . </s>
that would be a similar situation . </s>
my third and last point concern the role of the European Union . </s>
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission have play in the region and the funding which we have provide there , Commissioner Patten . </s>
you know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that include your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time come to finance it . </s>
but we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos can play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the Eu High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians do and invite the protagonist of the peace process ourselves . </s>
then we will have play the role which be commensurate with our participation and our contribution . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , the recent peace talk begin in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turn point in the history of the Middle East . </s>
it have take fifty year to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiation . </s>
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope , as Mr Patten say just now , that this postponement of the negotiation due to Syrian requirement will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East . </s>
this hope be contain in our motion for a resolution . </s>
we hope for a fair and balanced agreement base on respect for sovereignty and the right to live securely within safe and recognise border . </s>
All the foreign troop , include therefore the Syrian force , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution @card@ of the United Nations Security Council . </s>
dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July @card@ , the date promise by Ehud Barak ? </s>
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbour to the north ? </s>
we really hope and believe so . </s>
never have the party be so determine . </s>
One fundamental point to be stress be the balance which must be express in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people . </s>
There must also be a political balance between the participant in the negotiation . </s>
follow the attack in Hadera on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism . </s>
in term of balance , or should I say imbalance , I must add that it be to be regret that Europe be still play a minor political role in resolve this conflict . </s>
at midday , Mr Gama refer to the financial and commercial support provide by Europe to the region . </s>
despite everything , we be be force to recognise that the resumption of the peace process be largely due to the work of Washington . </s>
like other Arab country before them , the Syrian choose the Americans to sponsor the negotiation . </s>
this be the choice also make by Israel where Europe suffer from a partisan public image , and this be a fact , not a judgement . </s>
this be now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten , Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we be rely on their effort to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict . </s>
although it be difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity . </s>
area of Freedom , Security and Justice the next item be question to the Council ( B5-0040 / @card@ ) and the Commission ( B5-0041 / @card@ ) , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs , on the @card@ annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( Article @card@ of the TEU ) . </s>
Mr President , @card@ be the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council . </s>
these have be the most important moment in the Council 's expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union . </s>
the Council have decide to draw up a charter of citizen ' right - and we rejoice in this ; it have decide to implement Article @card@ of the Treaty , combat all form of discrimination and xenophobia , and it have decide to approximate the law on condition for admission and residence , as well as guarantee resident treatment which be fair and on an equal footing with the citizen of the Union . </s>
it have also reach a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposal for civil cooperation . </s>
this have be the year in which policy on justice and home affair have be provide with a Community framework . </s>
they have be put into the hand of a single Commissioner , Mr Antonio Vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well . </s>
furthermore , they have take on the task of create a &quot; scoreboard &quot; to verify the progress make in this area at Community level , but also - and this seem to me to be important - at the level of the Member States . </s>
we be please about this and we congratulate the council on these decision , despite the fact that , for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam include one disappointment : that of delay , for five year , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role take in it by the Court of Justice . </s>
however , if , on verify the progress make during @card@ , which be within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declaration and look at the decision actually take and carry out , the scene look considerably dark , Mr President . </s>
it be as if the Council have more than one face and two hand and what one sign up to , the other begrudge . </s>
despite all the commitment make at the high level , the Council do not manage to take the decision which it have envisage . </s>
programme multiply and overlap and there be no way of ascertain level of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this Parliament be unable to do so . </s>
we have present the council with a series of question and I know that it be the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them . </s>
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament . </s>
I say that there be no consistency between the decision take by the Council and the policy actually carry out . </s>
There be doubt in my Group and doubt also persist in this House , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework . </s>
Schengen have be incorporate , as we say earlier , into the acquis , but it have be do with very little transparency . </s>
not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , have be address to Parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the United Kingdom , nor on the incorporation of Greece , nor on the negotiation with Norway and Iceland . </s>
the same be true with regard to immigration policy . </s>
we have amuse ourselves with a pile of report , but we have no idea what have happen to these initiative ; they have disappear . </s>
we hope that @card@ will be the year for action , in the same way that @card@ be the year for expectation . </s>
we hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament . </s>
the Council have decide that justice and home affair policy must form part of the structure of the Union . </s>
the Council can act in accordance with Parliament 's decision , or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institution in this vitally important project . </s>
if it choose the second approach , it must be aware that this present risk and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice be build . </s>
alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institution , in order to move forward in another way . </s>
fulfil your obligation to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus prepare for the future . </s>
provide the Commission with the necessary resource and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress make at Community level and at the level of the Member States , and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decision make at Tampere and move towards a Union which be free , more just and more secure . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , it be rather move for me to return to this house in my capacity as a Member of the Council . </s>
I be one of the first Portuguese member of this House who , in @card@ , take the first step towards the integration of Portugal into the European Union , and I have to say , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , lady and gentleman , that the experience I gain here , political experience , have be extremely important in my life , and that the information we gain and the contribution that we be all able to make towards build Europe definitely mark the year that I spend here , and indeed my life . </s>
so it be with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleague from those day who be still in this House . </s>
the point I wish to make be that the Portuguese Presidency - to which the Minister for Justice , who be handle the field of justice and home affair , and I myself both belong - wish to usher in a new era with this Parliament , and to foster the relationship between the Council and Parliament . </s>
this will inevitably be influence by my parliamentary experience in this House , and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who be now the Minister for Justice and my colleague . </s>
we give an early signal when , before the start of the Portuguese Presidency , we meet with the President and Vice-Presidents of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs in Brussels . </s>
we be able to invite the chairman of that committee , Mr Watson , and some member of the committee to come to Lisbon , and to present our view concern the role of the Portuguese Presidency in this area to them . </s>
and we give an undertaking then that I now want to repeat formally : during all meeting of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs , a representative of the Council , at political level , not an official but a political representative of the Council , from one of our ' cabinet ' , will always be involve in the work of the committee ... ( Applause ) and whenever the committee think fit , and the Chairman request it , I myself or my colleague , the Minister for Justice , will come to Brussels to take part in the work of the meeting . </s>
we will accordingly give the chairman of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs the provisional agenda for the Council meeting in March and May , to allow contact to be establish beforehand on the subject to be discuss in the Council . </s>
we will do this today . </s>
turn to @card@ , we find ourselves in the special position of take stock of the German and Finnish presidency . </s>
I would like to start by say that , in addition to the reply that we shall be give here to Mrs Terrón i Cusí , who have present a proposal on behalf of her committee , we shall also be let her have a written reply at the end of these discussion . </s>
furthermore , I would like to say that the Council believe that @card@ be an important year in the field of justice and home affair . </s>
cooperation in the field of justice and home affair be notable for the significant change wrought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and , as a consequence , for the incorporation of Schengen into the Community framework . </s>
the German Presidency have an important task in this respect in achieve the transition from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system . </s>
then there be the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency , on 1 July @card@ . </s>
There be also a third notable event : the Tampere Summit , a European Council devote exclusively to justice and home affair . </s>
the Tampere Summit be mark by a new spirit and by a determination to put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there . </s>
the point that the Portuguese Presidency wish to reiterate here be that we intend to keep issue connect with the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of the presidency 's political agenda . </s>
as regard our reply to Mrs Terrón i Cusí , I shall try to respond to her question on home affair , and my colleague will then address the point relate to justice . </s>
as you know , the Schengen acquis apply in full to ten country , and in the course of @card@ , work will be do with a view to reach a decision on the acquis come into force in Denmark , Finland and Sweden , and also in Iceland and Norway . </s>
the Secretary-General of the Council have publish a collection of document cover the entire Schengen acquis , pend publication in the Official Journal once all the translation be available . </s>
this collection be , at present , available in six language and the remain translation be near completion . </s>
another issue I wish to raise concern programme in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the CEECs . </s>
in March @card@ , the Council adopt the Odysseus programme , a programme of training , exchange and cooperation in the field of policy on asylum , immigration and cross of external border . </s>
it apply to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provide for applicant country , and possibly third country also , to be associate with it . </s>

applicant country can be associate with project select by the management committee as long as this comply with the objective of the programme . </s>
the financial envelope envisage for @card@ be EUR 3 million . </s>
under the @card@ programme , the Commission receive @card@ application for finance , total EUR @card@ million , against a budget for @card@ of EUR 3 million . </s>
the Commission propose support for @card@ project , of which @card@ be for EUR @card@ @card@ and @card@ for amount over EUR @card@ @card@ . </s>
with regard to the OISIN programme , and I be now refer to the @card@ budget year , project be adopt for seminar , training , exchange of official , research and study , and operational action . </s>
of @card@ project in all , seven include applicant country . </s>
as regard sis , the Schengen Information System , I be please to report that the Member States be very positive about its operation and use . </s>
the increase in the number of positive result demonstrate the efficiency of the system and there be a continue increase in the number of report . </s>
with a view to develop a custom information system , agreement be reach with the Commission on a system which will permit provisional application of the convention on the Customs Information System as soon as a certain number of country have ratify this convention . </s>
Mrs Terrón i Cusí also mention an interinstitutional agreement . </s>
I ought to comment on this final point once my colleague , the Minister for Justice , have speak , but it be obvious that what I shall say be the result of an exchange of impression within the Council , and in particular between the two of us . </s>
I refer earlier to a new relationship with the Commission and with Parliament , with a view to achieve close link and provide Parliament with timely information on subject to be discuss by the Council . </s>
I would now like to state before you here that we firmly intend to consult the European Parliament , not only in those case stipulate by the Treaty , which we be oblige to do , but also to inform and consult Parliament whenever we believe that it be appropriate to widen this type of consultation , and when , in direct contact with the Commission , we believe that Parliament should be able to present its opinion . </s>
as regard information , we will communicate with Parliament on all matter which be important for establish the area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
this partnership between the Council and Parliament , building on the Commission 's role and the excellent work Commissioner Vitorino have always do , will make it possible for the Portuguese Presidency to represent a landmark in establish this area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
( sustained applause ) Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament , you will understand that it be even more move for me to be here than it be for my colleague Fernando Gomes . </s>
as Mrs Terrón i Cusí say in her speech , @card@ be a year of great expectation in the field of justice and home affair - an expectation realise with the come into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , an expectation realise with the conclusion of the Tampere Council , and a fundamental expectation , as from this year , that will be realise in the form of specific action . </s>
we be all aware that , to this end , it be essential for the Council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino have the remit of establish . </s>
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency 's earnest desire for political agreement to be reach on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March . </s>
turn to the specific question that Mrs Terrón i Cusí have put to us , I shall group them into three basic area : the fight against organise crime , the operation of the Judicial Network , particularly as regard criminal matter , and question on Europol . </s>
regard the fight against organise crime , @card@ mark the implementation of several important action stem from the Vienna action plan , which result in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations , in development in cooperation and in establish point of contact between the Member States for receive information relevant to the fight against money laundering . </s>
and I must not forget the Finnish Presidency 's proposal for a Council decision which be be consider in the Multi-disciplinary Group . </s>
this be an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by secure approval for the Eu strategy for the fight against organise crime in the new millennium , but also so as to overcome the difficulty associate with the divergence of view that exist , particularly at Council level , on issue concern the fight against organise crime . </s>
with this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we be already establish with the French Presidency , with the aim of organise a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council . </s>
if this be not to be a mere media event , it will need to be carefully prepare by a joint committee , the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency have already propose . </s>
our relation with third country represent another important aspect of the fight against organise crime . </s>
here , in addition to the work be do in the group of expert on the Pre-Accession Pact , it be important that it have prove possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organise crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation , a plan which be now be finalise , and to organise meeting of liaison official from the Member States , in Moscow , and to develop a set of further initiative . </s>
another area be Eu involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocol , and in the convention be prepare in the framework of the Council of Europe , in particular on cyber crime . </s>
as this be an issue which have become important in the justice and home affair programme , the presidency believe that it be worthwhile , bear in mind the principle of Chapter VI of the Treaty , to explore suitable mean of provide the European Parliament with improve information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiation under the United Nations Convention . </s>
with regard to the Judicial Network , significant progress have be make , in particular the launch at the end of @card@ of the dedicated telecommunication system of the European Judicial Network , whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group have develop a series of action to implement the @card@ action plan . </s>
however , we must stress that it be vital for approval to be give as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserve continuity , to the work do under the previous action plan . </s>
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress have be make on the legal protection of the euro , and the European Parliament be be consult on a framework decision which be of fundamental strategic importance . </s>
we believe that if legal protection of the euro be to be credible , we must avoid have a multiplicity of instrument , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument cover all necessary aspect , include those feature in initiative already present by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself have call for . </s>
it be important in this field to implement measure relate to the mutual recognition of judicial decision , and we believe that on the basis of work already do , it will be possible , at least in the field of seizure of asset , for measure to be adopt in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decision . </s>
lastly then , Europol , which start its work in @card@ . </s>
the Council approve a set of instrument , with which Parliament be familiar , to make Europol 's operation viable but , of course , the fundamental issue of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain , and these be issue which have naturally take on a new dimension in view of the political decision take in Tampere to reinforce Europol 's power and , above all , to give it an operational dimension . </s>
the French Presidency have pass an important work document to us which set out various scenario for address and resolve the issue of democratic control and judicial control of Europol . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency will shortly be present a work document on the Eurojust network , since although it be not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust , this option can be rule out at present . </s>
for this reason , it be essential that the Council 's debate on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conduct in parallel , so that conclusion can be reach in parallel also . </s>
I believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol . </s>
we be familiar with Parliament 's view and we know that Parliament be aware of the view of the Council 's legal adviser . </s>
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolve the issue of democratic control of Europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all party involve . </s>
Mr President , member of the Council , lady and gentleman , first of all , without wish to compete with the Ministers as regard emotion , I have to say that I be not move , rather I be disturb to have two personal friend in the presidency for the first time , and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of power which be essential for the proper functioning of the Union ! </s>
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for have ask the question which have give rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the member who , in their various committee , have actively participate in prepare this annual debate . </s>
I would also like to thank the representative of the national parliament and of civil society . </s>
in this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission 's view of the most important event in @card@ . </s>
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that @card@ be both a turn point and a year of consolidation by the union on issue of freedom , security and justice . </s>
it have already be mention that the Treaty of Amsterdam come into force in May and this Parliament state that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty be its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
at the same time , it also represent a quantum leap in qualitative term , and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy . </s>
this project be not so much a project of the institution as a project of the citizen of our common Union . </s>
and it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizen reside in the territory of the European Union , recognise that this be only meaningful if it be root in a secure base , with solid foundation in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal term , and in which our citizen can have real confidence . </s>
the Union 's commitment to establish an area of freedom , security and justice be confirm at Tampere . </s>
I would like to emphasise the strong political message send out by the European Council , reaffirm the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attach to a fundamental project , together with various political guideline and priority which will turn this area into a reality , follow a progressive strategy , within a time-frame of five year , and that , above all , the three component of this area should be in balance : freedom , security and justice . </s>
@card@ be also mark by the German Presidency 's initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union 's development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental right in force at European Union level in a charter , so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizen . </s>
as I have already say on a number of occasion , I be in favour - the Commission be in favour - of draw up a charter which would reflect , on the broad basis possible and as part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional tradition of the Member States and the general principle of Community law , rather than be a mere statement of the low common denominator . </s>
in my capacity as a representative of the Commission , I will ensure that the charter and the action stem from it represent an affirmation of a Union base on a set of fundamental right which be an integral part of Europe 's common heritage . </s>
that be the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European union in the eye of every European citizen , an enlarged Europe base on respect for right and freedom , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other word , a Union root in the political value which underpin contemporary democracy . </s>
I must not overlook the fact that @card@ mark the beginning of the @card@ parliamentary term of the European Parliament , that it be the year in which the new Commission take up its duty and , as a consequence , the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the area of justice and home affair assume his responsibility . </s>
in addition to these event , I would like to remind Parliament of some item that be approve in @card@ . </s>
in the field of immigration , border and asylum , the Commission present a proposal for a regulation on set up the Eurodac database , and a proposal for a directive on condition for admit third country national into Member States of the European union with a view to reunite family , as part of a vigorous policy of integrate legal resident in the territory of the European Union . </s>
we also present a communication on common procedure concern asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorise the Commission to open negotiation with Iceland and Norway on an agreement design to extend the rule apply by the Member States of the European union under the Dublin Convention to those two country . </s>
the Commission make an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and ultimately , in December , it present a proposal aim at establish a European refugee fund . </s>
in the field of judicial cooperation , the Commission present proposal for regulation aim at the &quot; communitisation &quot; of certain convention . </s>
these be the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgement in civil and commercial matter ( Brussels I ) , the convention on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of judgement in matrimonial matter ( Brussels II ) , and a third convention concern the service of judicial and extrajudicial document in civil or commercial matter . </s>
in @card@ , we also present a communication on victim of crime in the European Union , which lead to discussion that be give great impetus at Tampere . </s>
this communication call for minimum standard for protect the victim of crime , in particular as regard their access to justice and their right to compensation , include the cost of justice . </s>
we also present a proposal for a decision on combat fraud and forgery of non-cash mean of payment . </s>
in the field of European Union legislation on combat financial crime , the Commission present a proposal for an amend directive on money laundering . </s>
in @card@ , Europol take up its duty and we in the Commission , echo the Portuguese Presidency 's statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affair and discussion start on the implementation of new power attribute to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the link between Europol and the relevant judicial institution , and in particular Eurojust . </s>
in @card@ , the Commission also present its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drug , which underpin the strategy approve by the Helsinki European Council . </s>
this list of action , which be not exhaustive , should , here today , in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the member of this House , help to make it clear that , while @card@ be a year of consolidation for Eu action in this key area , it also - I very much hope - represent the start of a new phase , mark by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
for this reason , @card@ will no doubt be a year for test how the Eu 's institution respond to our citizen ' demand for guarantee freedom of movement , with respect for their right and guarantee of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection . </s>
in other word , @card@ will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundation for an enlarged political union for the next decade - a test for the Council , for Parliament and for the Commission . </s>
as I have already say , the Commission be aware of its own responsibility and it be accordingly put the finish touch to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institution and other interested party can assess the progress make in implement the require measure and in comply with the deadline set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusion of the Tampere European Council . </s>
this scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning . </s>
it will also , and above all , be an instrument for increase transparency and increase the accountability of all the European Union 's institution towards the public . </s>
it be for the public , therefore , that we be develop the area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
the progress make will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council , nor even to the European Parliament , but to a combination of European institution and to the Member States themselves , in as much as - as have already be point out here - specific task on the scoreboard will be entrust to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
in the come week , I shall be make a tour of capital to sound out the opinion of the various minister for justice and home affair . </s>
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project . </s>
and we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council , take account of the sounding that I have just mention . </s>
it be my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument provide political and strategic guidance to all the institution , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny . </s>
for this reason , and I believe that this be a challenge we be all face , I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union bring to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in area which be essential for citizenship , for legality and , ultimately , for democracy itself . </s>
in addition to the scoreboard , I would like to anticipate the follow initiative that the Commission intend to present during @card@ - and I would like to emphasise that I be delight the Portuguese Presidency be treat progress in the area of freedom , security and justice as a priority in its work programme . </s>
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which be also the political message of Tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carry forward by subsequent presidency . </s>
regard immigration and asylum , the Commission intend to present proposal for create a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugee ; to initiate an analysis of criterion and condition for improve implementation of the Dublin convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis , in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam ; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already publish concern standard for a common asylum process throughout the Union ; and to present proposal with a view to prepare legislation on the grant of residence permit to victim of trafficking in human being who cooperate with judicial action against network of trafficker . </s>
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarify the role of action plan as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and to make progress in adapt Community agreement in the field of readmission by include standard clause . </s>
furthermore , on the subject of cross the external border of Member States , which be a central issue regard the free movement of person , I shall , in the next few day , be present a proposal for a regulation update the list of third country whose national be require to hold visa for cross the external border . </s>
turn to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligation , I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standard ensure an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceeding . </s>
I also intend to continue discussion on the preparation of specific common procedural rule for simplify and speed up cross-border judicial proceeding relate to small commercial and consumer claim , alimony claim and non-contested claim . </s>
as a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusion , the Commission will be present its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organise crime . </s>
we will be organise and support action include , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implement mutual recognition of judicial decision in criminal matter . </s>
the Commission also intend to present specific measure in the field of crime prevention , so as to encourage exchange of good practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme finance by the Community for this purpose . </s>
the Commission will also support the presidency 's effort to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue . </s>
the Commission will fulfil the remit give to it at Tampere to present proposal for approve definition , criminal charge and common sanction in the field of trafficking in human being , economic exploitation of immigrant , and sexual exploitation of woman and child , with special emphasis on combat the use of new mean of communication , notably the Internet , for distribute child pornography . </s>
we be also prepare a communication to instigate a debate on mean of ensure great security in the information and knowledge society and in combat computer crime . </s>
the year @card@ also mark the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy @card@ . </s>
in this field the Commission , in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament , will give its full support to the Interinstitutional conference to be hold on drug in February . </s>
with regard to Schengen , without wish to trespass on the territory of the Council , or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework , I would like to stress , on the topical subject of restore border control , that the Commission wish to reiterate its willingness to ensure great control of the application of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority . </s>
the recent restore of certain internal border control lead me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the condition for adopt a legislative instrument base on Article @card@ of the Treaty . </s>
as be emphasise at Tampere , and as part of our preparation for the Feira European Council in June @card@ , we will have to prepare a summary of the implication of the new external dimension of justice and home affair with a view to adopt cross-pillar policy strategy , which strengthen the link between the Union 's internal and external policy in this field and help to uphold the Union 's position on the world stage . </s>
nevertheless , I must make it clear that all these action will , of course , have to take into account the principle agree at the Helsinki European Council concern applicant country , so that those applicant can cooperate and also be associate as quickly as possible with this project of create an area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
furthermore , it be important to remember that @card@ will see the start of the justice and home affair negotiation with the first group of applicant country and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in prepare the negotiate dossier on the second group with which it be agree to open accession negotiation at Helsinki . </s>
lastly , I would like to state once again that the Commission intend to be in the pole position in present proposal for implement the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective role in exercise their right to initiative and in carry forward the legislative process itself . </s>
as I have tell Parliament , the task before us be immense and ambitious , and the Commission need to have the necessary human resource to respond to this challenge . </s>
we hope that we can count on the support of Parliament , and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resource and to achieve these objective , so that the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice become a reality as soon as possible , thus allow us all to contribute , in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , to the realisation of this project , which be , without a doubt , the &quot; jewel in the crown &quot; of the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
Mr President , have devote itself over the last @card@ year to establish a common internal market , the House now face the major new task of create an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institution of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other 's competence . </s>
Commissioner Vitorino , although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , word have often fail me in the past when face with the conduct which the Council have demonstrate towards us . </s>
it look , as Mr Schulz once aptly say in committee , as if the Council understand the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the Council have free rein , security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will . </s>
Minister Gomes , I have , of course , hear what you have say and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
I should like to raise three point which for us , as member of the PPE Group , must be focal point when such an area be create . </s>
First : a common asylum law must be create and the burden of absorb refugee must be distribute . </s>
the Council must start by at long last ensure that EURODAC be adopt in order to create the basic requirement for classify asylum seeker . </s>
as far as a European asylum law be concern , a start be in fact make at Vienna and Tampere . </s>
unfortunately , however , it have highlight the difficulty rather than propose solution . </s>
I therefore call on the Council representative to look beyond their national boundary and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union . </s>
similarly , it can be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent . </s>
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda . </s>
secondly : the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organise crime , include by Europol and Eurojust . </s>
the planned introduction of Eurojust be one of our significant success from Tampere and must now be implement forthwith . </s>
we welcome the fact that Europol have finally be able to start work . </s>
however , the Council should also bear in mind that , if we be to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen Europol 's remit , as decide at Tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officer and extend its remit to operational activity . </s>
we be not just call for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here be &quot; Less be sometimes more ! </s>
&quot; with most of Europol employee currently engage in self-control for the purpose of data protection law and question be ask by @card@ national parliament , we may have a great deal of control , but it be inefficient control . </s>
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hamper the work of Europol . </s>
at the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggest in Tampere as a step in the right direction . </s>
thirdly : the extension to Parliament 's right in this context . </s>
if the establishment of such an area , in which the Union can also intervene in the basic right of the citizen , be only decide by diplomat and bureaucrat , while the elect representative of Europe be reduce to follow development like a rabbit watch a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizen . </s>
There be therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision right in this respect and , as we have already say , to strengthen the principle of democratic control . </s>
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizen of Europe , not against them . </s>
Mr President , I have nothing further to say to the Council . </s>
the previous speaker have quote me from the last committee meeting and say it all ! </s>
why do the Council find it so hard to work with us in create an area of freedom , security and justice ? </s>
I find this question more and more worrying . </s>
allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view . </s>
the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice hover at the interface between the constituent element of national sovereignty . </s>
the police and judicial policy be quite clearly element of sovereignty , in other word sensitive political area in the Member States , and shift the interface of these and communitising these policy , i. e. delegate power from the national capital , from Lisbon , Berlin or Paris , to Brussels represent a transfer of power . </s>
of course it be very , very difficult to break away from the executive form which have be hand down to us , even if we recognise that police cooperation be necessary ; we can only fight international crime at European level . </s>
so we have to draw our conclusion and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instrument available . </s>
as a result , the government which need to do this and which recognise that need , also realise that , in implement this , they be take away their own power . </s>
then there be the European Parliament , which be also complicate . </s>
in the final analysis , however , we must find a way forward , because if we carry on as we have in the past , and with last year 's experience , then what will happen be that the security debate and the debate about citizen ' right will be marginalised in the national parliament as a result of make it a half national , half European structure . </s>
it have not quite take off in the European Parliament and the Council meet behind closed door . </s>
if the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice be keep secret , then we shall not win the citizen over to it . </s>
in other word , the stability of democracy be at stake if we discuss it . </s>
this be why I frequently get so work up , but not over the Council of Ministers . </s>
generally , they too be elect member of Parliament : Mr Gomes , Mr Costa , Commissioner Vitorino , in principle we be all in the same boat . </s>
however , I should like to make an appeal to the Council apparatchik . </s>
the follow principle apply : he who prepare decision , in this case the Council apparatchik , anticipate the decision , which be why the Council apparatchik should demonstrate more democratic spirit . </s>
I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time . </s>
scoreboard sound like skateboard in German . </s>
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulate what must be implement , when and by whom . </s>
this Vitorino plan be what we need : clear , precise project with a clear , define timetable . </s>
Mr Vitorino , whom I would like to thank for his speech , can give us that , provide that he have the necessary financial and human resource . </s>
let us give him those resource , then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain . </s>
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency be make justice and home affair one of its top priority or jewel in the crown . </s>
I be also encourage by Commissioner Patten 's comment this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crisis . </s>
perhaps that will end scandal like the failure of state to deploy in Kosovo the police they promise . </s>
I just want to highlight three area among many where we need quick progress . </s>
the first be asylum . </s>
it be essential to establish a single European system , but one base on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception condition , include an end to routine detention . </s>
decision on asylum should take month - not year . </s>
the second area be that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wish in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that include not just Member State citizen but third country national . </s>
let our citizen know that our common policy in justice and home affair be about freedom , not just about repression . </s>
the last area I want to mention be convergence of civil and criminal justice system . </s>
Eurosceptics claim that this be a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on . </s>
but the case of the suspect want for question in connection with the murder of three woman in France , include British student , Isabel Peake , who be throw off a train , show why we need mutual recognition . </s>
arrest and release in Madrid , he be now be extradite after arrest in Lisbon . </s>
whatever the Eurosceptics say , it be in all our interest to get cooperation in such matter . </s>
finally , as have already be say , it be essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this , to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these area , with democratic and judicial scrutiny . </s>
Mr President , all I can say about @card@ be this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter . </s>
I hope that it work out . </s>
the Tampere Summit be certainly an important milestone in @card@ for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular . </s>
numerous question be still outstanding . </s>
answer be still await . </s>
since Tampere , there have be an imbalance between positive action and mere declaration of intent . </s>
regulation on nationality and the integration of people from third country be still outstanding . </s>
on the other hand , quite specific action have be call for on the subject of safety of life . </s>
the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important project in the immediate future . </s>
however , it be difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implement legally when you think of the people who be not currently citizen of the Union . </s>
the Europol agreement have now officially enter into force . </s>
in Tampere , the question of grant operational power be discuss . </s>
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate well parliamentary and judicial control . </s>
the agreement also attract criticism with regard to EURODAC . </s>
Parliament have amend the contractual text . </s>
Care must be take to ensure that the Council comply with Parliament 's modus operandi . </s>
unfortunately , no initiative have yet materialise regard other matter and we still await them . </s>
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice have so far be an area with no clear regulation in important sector . </s>
and yet we owe this to the citizen of Europe . </s>
have listen to the justice and home affair minister , I be optimistic and I be assume that we will succeed in the next six month . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the oral question table by Mrs Terrón i Cusí show that this House be take a firm stance . </s>
indeed , six month after the election of this new Parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe . </s>
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this . </s>
we be all aware of the enormous expectation of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice . </s>
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all thing political require us to take specific action to tackle their problem . </s>
this be the sine qua non condition for reconcile the popular and political sphere . </s>
for Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged . </s>
a proper plan for fight unemployment must be establish for this be the scourge which be allow the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movement . </s>
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrant and refugee . </s>
the virtually systematic condition of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seeker be no longer acceptable . </s>
all asylum-seeker must be entitle to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect . </s>
last week , and somewhat by chance , I witness , at Roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young woman , admittedly illegal immigrant , be be return to Conakry . </s>
they be treat like the bad criminal . </s>
they be strip naked and drag along the floor by their hair , surround by a horde of state security police . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour . </s>
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who be flee dictatorship . </s>
the Commission have propose create a European fund for refugee to which Parliament be favourably dispose . </s>
instead of all this waffle about the budget grant to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up . </s>
the Presidency and the Council can realise what be incomprehensibly reject in Tampere , even though this summit provide an important basis . </s>
likewise , we can simply record the rise in xenophobic feeling in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without take wide-ranging action . </s>
the law against racism must be harmonise . </s>
What direction do you intend to give to Article @card@ of the EC Treaty ? </s>
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wage for man and woman ? </s>
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ? </s>
we must take the good from each of our country . </s>
when six European country have grant the right to vote , the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European election , to all people from outside the Community who have live in Europe for more than five year . </s>
the regularisation of illegal immigrant in certain country , include your own , must act as an example to other . </s>
these illegal immigrant nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlord , an oppress workforce subject to economic exploitation , render them modern-day slave . </s>
in more general term , this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority group and immigrant . </s>
immigration be too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive response . </s>
How do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration be a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which be , and will remain , essential in the context of population ? </s>
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrant in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seeker ? </s>
Mr President , there be a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice . </s>
the European Union be an economic powerhouse but we be not in a position to pontificate when it come to our treatment of refugee . </s>
the level of racism in our society be terrifying . </s>
Ireland , for generation , send her son and daughter to place of safety throughout the world , but now when the Celtic tiger be provide wealth and prosperity beyond our expectation , we be show a very ugly side to our character . </s>
racism in Ireland be endemic . </s>
it have be a relative shock to our political leader to find we must now take a share of the refugee that have be come into the European union for a long time . </s>
we be come from behind in deal with the issue and the government be do its utmost to catch up . </s>
There be a willingness but fear pervade , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union . </s>
Mr President , we take note that the excuse-making , reticent Presidency , which , in recent month , have prevent us from hold a debate such as the one we have be able to hold today , have come to an end . </s>
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz 's remark , and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involve in the area of freedom , security and justice , without have to derogate from their own power . </s>
nevertheless , to avoid the customary circus , which every six month have us indiscriminately attack the Presidency of the Council , maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five year . </s>
the two identical-sounding question which be under discussion be , of course , underpin by a mantra of the kind which , in recent year , have increasingly transform politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding , but pernicious . </s>
and our current Eu mantra be AFSJ : area for Freedom , Security and Justice . </s>
behind this lie another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area . </s>
and who be not in favour of security , freedom and justice ? </s>
the problem be just that this be not something the Eu can introduce by mean of legislative decree and other supranational resolution . </s>
Freedom , security and justice be the root system of any society , reflect its history , corporate experience and political development . </s>
a system of this kind be not something the Eu can introduce without society 's sustain damage as a result . </s>
but it be precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concern security , freedom and justice . </s>
the agenda be not design to secure justice for the citizen . </s>
that be already secure by mean of the various national legal system . </s>
the agenda be design to transfer vital part of society 's criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the Eu 's control . </s>
it be concern with increase integration which , as part of a duplicitous package , involve increase repression and control . </s>
you just have to think of all the resolution concern Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc . </s>
any democrat can spot two key problem . </s>
first of all , the initiative which have be plan be completely unrealistic . </s>
How be it envisage that the Eu 's institution , which be already stretch well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious project concern to fruition ? </s>
think of last year 's deadly criticism of the Commission 's lack of propriety , ethic and accountability . </s>
it also , of course , find indirect expression in the question . </s>
but , secondly , the project will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracy . </s>
as long as the Eu revolve around the internal market , only the body be be attack . </s>
now , it be the soul . </s>
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony . </s>
we have Commissioner Patten speak in this house in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which have be accept , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserve and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious section into the hand of the terrorist . </s>
the IRA terrorist have not give up any of their weapon , nor have the loyalist terrorist , yet the police be be force into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community . </s>
let me just look at the figure from the day that the agreement be sign . </s>
in @card@ , we have @card@ murder . </s>
in @card@ , we have 7 murder and that do not include the Omagh bomb where @card@ be kill and @card@ injure . </s>
between @card@ and @card@ , loyalist assault and shoot @card@ people , while republican assault and shoot @card@ people . </s>
charge bring against loyalist in @card@ total @card@ , while those against republican total @card@ . </s>
since January @card@ , there have be six shooting by loyalist and two by republican , loyalist have be involve in six serious assault , one lead to another murder , while republican have engage in five serious assault . </s>
Mr President , that situation can continue and need remedy . </s>
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam have set an important objective for the Union . </s>
this be a task which all MEPs , the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as have be say already , of an area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
the Tampere Council , the motor and architect of this objective , have propose certain goal , but five year , the time scale lay down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty , be too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problem require . </s>
my first point be that Parliament must not be exclude from the important decision to be take in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guarantee , especially with regard to this project which affect the citizen , as the Commissioner have explain very well . </s>
my second point be that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopt common procedural rule and , above all , put an end to the current confusion between migration for political reason and migration for economic reason . </s>
the recent law on alien adopt in my country , Spain , and in Belgium , be a reminder that there be an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy . </s>
my third and final point relate to the external activity of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum . </s>
we must not and can give the impression that the Union exclusively wish to defend itself from an avalanche of refugee and economic migrant . </s>
we must opt for a policy of cooperate in the development of our neighbour country in the East and the Mediterranean area , but we must do so with rigour , with economic mean and in close collaboration with public institution , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizen whose most basic right be violate or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential need . </s>
finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizen of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship . </s>
the Euro , employment , even security , be not enough . </s>
they need a ' European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once say . </s>
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speaker , I want to go back to the word of our Portuguese minister and Mr Vitorino . </s>
this trio 's word be like music to our ear as Mr Ceyhun have say . </s>
as with all music it need to be a fine tune and properly orchestrate . </s>
Many of us of here be very optimistic about the next six month . </s>
the tune that will be play will be one that the people of Europe will be listen to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune . </s>
as describe this afternoon it will go a long way towards drown out some of the unpleasant tune we hear during the European election and over the last few month . </s>
the Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council build on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union . </s>
One area though be extremely important , and this House must be involve in it : namely scrutiny . </s>
There be so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that be outline to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it be scrutinise , that the people in this Parliament and the member of the national parliament and the citizen of Europe be aware of everything involve in it . </s>
and we must make certain that the detail be applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different country . </s>
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspect of the resolution before us this afternoon , one or two of which be refer to earlier on . </s>
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial system in the various country and the cooperation on crime . </s>
that be an area that European citizen will respond to and will be happy about . </s>
but the Commission and Council must know that there be many people in this House who have reservation about the Eurodac system , for example . </s>
we accept the predominant role of the Council in this , but there be reservation and I be sure that the Council will listen to the word come from the elect parliamentarian here when they go through it in more detail . </s>
Mr Schulz say early on that he be not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' . </s>
Anyone who be English or British or follow cricket know what a scoreboard be . </s>
a scoreboard tell people the score ; it have to be up-to-date and it have to be clear and visible . </s>
I be sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that be so . </s>
at the end of six month I hope that the music be still play and that the European people be still listen . </s>
Mr President , I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry , Mr Costa , and to thank them for the welcome they give my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meeting we enjoy . </s>
Amsterdam and Tampere have give us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today show . </s>
I would like to make three brief point . </s>
the first be that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament . </s>
it be barely six month since Amsterdam impose a duty on our two organisation to work together ; we have be size each other up , we have have a few minor spat , but we need to work effectively together . </s>
let us stop the shadow-boxing . </s>
let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duty that the treaty impose on us and the timescales allow for full democratic debate . </s>
involve us please in your discussion on both policy and process . </s>
let us not pretend that national parliament be able to exercise effective democratic control of government activity in this area . </s>
my second point be that we need a properly resourced Commission . </s>
we have establish a new Directorate-General , yet it have only @card@ people all tell . </s>
There be an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person have arrive . </s>
we be set the Commission a massive task , not least in the draw up of the scoreboard . </s>
the Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resource that the Commission need . </s>
finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency have put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda . </s>
all good thing come in three , especially in our policy area . </s>
Two hundred year ago it be liberty , equality and fraternity , and thing go along very well until the government of the left raise equality above the other . </s>
now it be freedom , security and justice , and I hope that the current government of the left will heed the word of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security , important as it be , above the equally important need of freedom and justice . </s>
although the main achievement in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mention , we must remember that there be still room for progress . </s>
the role of the Court of Justice be still too limited and communitisation be incomplete . </s>
the unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border control be a clear illustration of this . </s>
the decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights be to be welcome but it be difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , include all people , whatever their nationality , or exclude some . </s>
the total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political right of all European resident be to be regret . </s>
although action plan establish by the high-level work group aim to limit migratory flow in the future , these plan do nothing to improve human right , civil liberty and the economic situation in the country concern . </s>
we know that readmission clause be include in the cooperation and association agreement . </s>
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non-refoulement ' [ no turn back ] . </s>
furthermore , it should be note that these provision be adopt within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consult Parliament . </s>
however , the main concern remain ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I would like to join my colleague in welcome the representative of the Council as well as the Commissioner . </s>
I thank them for their statement to the House . </s>
rather than go back over the area that have already be cover I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drug and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our society . </s>
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which be do by the Finnish Presidency in bring forward coordinate plan and action between the Member States . </s>
we already have , on the international side , plan in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on . </s>
but to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who be try to come off drug , and give them proper control and proper mechanism for rehabilitation ; secondly , to coordinate amongst the police force and the judiciary with regard to common penalty and common law ; thirdly , to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous word of &quot; normalisation &quot; and &quot; harm reduction &quot; and show that any weakening of our resolve in make sure that drug be not legalise must be for the good of all our people . </s>
Mr President , I would like to use the few second of speak time to which I be entitle to point out , or remind , the representative of the Commission that , in Belgium , the government be currently pursue a policy under which thousand and possibly ten of thousand of illegal alien be be legalise and be to receive permanent right of residence , right to be reunite with their family , etc . </s>
this be a Belgian government measure which fly in the face of the Schengen Treaty . </s>
I lodge a write complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on @card@ December . </s>
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the foreseeable future , of the step the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian state , in accordance with Article @card@ of the Treaty . </s>
Mr President , esteem gentleman from Portugal , especially the Council representative , you face great expectation on our part . </s>
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectation relatively quickly in at least one small segment . </s>
I refer to Eurodac . </s>
you will remember that we decide with great expectation here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum application , in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which Member State be responsible for implement the asylum procedure . </s>
we vote clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attach to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be . </s>
we be of the opinion that EURODAC be become a reality . </s>
even in Tampere , we be of the opinion that Eurodac be become a reality . </s>
however , the Council then take another direction at the very next summit in December and take a huge step backwards by decide what we have absolutely reject , i. e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attach to the Council and that , where possible , Gibraltar would still be use to exert pressure . </s>
this be a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see . </s>
my urgent request on behalf of the Group be that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac be implement immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedure . </s>
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be do us a great service . </s>
Mr President , Ministers , Commissioner , the @card@ harvest of decision be indeed rich , so much so that it become difficult to gather , i. e. to put those decision into practice . </s>
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implement the decision they have jointly make . </s>
however , the past year be positively mark by some momentous decision , such as the decision to begin implement the Treaty of Amsterdam , the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar , and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common direction , priority and goal with a view to create a common area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
without wish to ignore the progress which have be make , we , the European Parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decision in many area , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament . </s>
from what I have say , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament be not prepare to simply play the role of observer . </s>
neither will it stop raise vital issue . </s>
for example , how much progress be you willing to make and what measure , legislative or otherwise , will you be take to combat the scourge of trafficking in human being , child pornography on the Internet , drug , and organise crime ? </s>
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ? </s>
How do you intend to go about integrate immigrant into the Community , reunite them with their family and recognise their right and duty on an equal footing with those of the citizen of Europe ? </s>
in light of this new international demographic class portray by expert at the UN , be it not about time you abandon your traditional , conservative view on refugee and immigrant ? </s>
I have great expectation for the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
Mr President , I welcome much , indeed most , of what have be say in this debate . </s>
but I want to add a word of caution . </s>
we risk have not too few charter of right in this Community , but too many : national , European Union and European Convention ; not too few tribunal have the final say about our right but possibly too many - there be the court across the river there , there be the Court in Luxembourg . </s>
There be also court in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh . </s>
we must make sure that what we do make clear sense . </s>
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdiction about right , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security . </s>
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the high possible common standard and to find way of secure these . </s>
but we must look always to subsidiarity . </s>
like everybody in this House , I want freedom , justice and security . </s>
I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , I would very quickly like to make one point . </s>
various member raise question about the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
the President of Parliament have make us aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the Minister for Justice , and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the question put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attend next week . </s>
( sustained applause ) thank you , Minister . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
Mr President , I be grateful for the Council 's oral , and also write , reply . </s>
their efficiency have be truly remarkable . </s>
I will save a few second because I want to propose to the council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens ' right and freedom , Justice and Home Affairs . </s>
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these reply and to express our concern to the Commission as well . </s>
personally , I be please with some of the reply , for example , in relation to issue as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention , which we hope will be review , and I be please with the word of the Minister for Justice with regard to try to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authority . </s>
I also hope that the same be do in relation to parliamentary control . </s>
representative of the Council , within the next month we be go to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament . </s>
I be sure that , with the willingness that you have show today , the first thing you will do , in this new climate of understand between us , will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you . </s>
question Time ( Council ) the next item be Question Time ( B5-0003 / @card@ ) . </s>
we will examine question to the Council . </s>
question no 1 by ( H-0780 / @card@ ) : subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey the two recent earthquake in Turkey register more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubt about Turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactor at Akkuyu , while energy reserve produce by the Atatürk dam be export to third country and the Eu spend a slice of its budget on repair the damage wrought by the earthquake . </s>
Turkey 's nuclear plan B which ignore the risk to the population and ecosystem of Turkey and the surround region B prompt the suspicion that there be underlie plan previously determine by Turkey 's political and military leader to acquire nuclear technology enable them to build nuclear weapon , as evidence by their attempt to buy reactor of Canadian origin of the type acquire by India and Pakistan . </s>
What step will the Council take to prevent nuclear accident and the proliferation of nuclear weapon in a country that wish to join the Eu but spend enormous amount on nuclear programme while receive financial aid from the Eu budget ? </s>
Mr President , the Council wish to point out that Turkey be a signatory to the convention on Nuclear Safety , the objective of which should allay the fear express by Mr Souladakis . </s>
the aim of this convention , which come into force on @card@ October @card@ , be precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by mean of national measure and through international cooperation . </s>
it further aim to ensure that nuclear installation be equip with continue protection against potential radiological risk , so as to protect individual , society at large and the environment against the harmful effect of the ionise radiation that can be emit by such installation . </s>
the convention , as you will be aware , also cover the prevention of accident which have radiological effect and the limitation of such effect when incident of this kind occur . </s>
I would also like to remind member that , as a candidate for membership of the European Union , Turkey will - and this be a pre-accession condition , which be an important point - sooner or later , as part of its own pre-accession strategy , have to adopt a set of policy gear towards adopt the entire acquis communautaire in good time , and include therefore all provision already in force on nuclear safety . </s>
thank you for your answer . </s>
however , I would just like to add the following . </s>
Turkey be only look to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit . </s>
nevertheless , rumour have it that it plan to buy Candu reactor of the type acquire by Pakistan and India which be use for nuclear weapon . </s>
in this respect , the issue require close examination , because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people 's suspicion . </s>
my second point concern the safety of these plant . </s>
in area of high seismic risk , it be not enough just to have secure , earthquake-proof building . </s>
speak as an engineer , I can tell you that we carry out test to investigate the effect of certain risk factor in extreme circumstance . </s>
however , we can carry out test on nuclear plant which be in operation ; it be just not possible . </s>
with this in mind , it go without say that nuclear plant a priori should not be build in area prone to earthquake . </s>
in this respect , and because Turkey be situate on the periphery of the European Union , we should be help it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country . </s>
that be our role and this be the point of my question . </s>
I recognise the relevance of the argument that Mr Souladakis have put forward . </s>
this be , of course , a highly sensitive issue . </s>
furthermore , it will be evident that this be a matter that do not only affect Turkey , in view of that country 's proximity to the existing territory of the European Union . </s>
it also affect other state neighbour the Eu with which we maintain relation . </s>
we understand your concern and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussion that we will be have with Turkey to define that country 's own pre-accession strategy agenda . </s>
this question will naturally be one of our key concern , and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account . </s>
Mr President , concern Mr Newton Dunn 's question , I think it be common knowledge , although it be worth mention for the record , that , since @card@ , the General Secretariat of the Council have be publish a monthly report of the definitive legislative act approve by the Council . </s>
this report include , as you be aware , statement for the Minutes , with vote against , abstention and explanation of vote . </s>
since May @card@ , that be to say , since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam itself , this report have also contain the act for which the Council do not act in its capacity as a legislative body , except for certain act of limited importance , such as decision of a procedural nature . </s>
in this case , the report may also contain the result of a vote , if the Council see fit . </s>
in addition to this , and in accordance with the internal regulation approve in @card@ , and subsequently replace by the Council 's decision of @card@ May @card@ , the General Secretariat publish the result of any vote and explanation of vote in press release , after each Council session , whenever the Council act in its capacity as a legislative body , as well as in other case , by mean of an ad hoc decision take by the Council itself . </s>
since the Treaty of Amsterdam come into force and whenever the Council have act in its legislative capacity - and this be an important distinction in term of the way ministerial meeting work - the result and the explanation of vote as well as the statement record in the Minutes have , to all intent and purpose , be publish , on a regular basis . </s>
as the rule govern publication be the same for produce the monthly report of the Council 's act and for press release , the final vote will be show in exactly the same way , wherever it be publish , apart from any error which may conceivably occur . </s>
as for the question by Mrs Frahm and Mr Sjöstedt , I can confirm that , under the term of Article @card@ ( 2 ) of the Treaty , as amend by the Treaty of Amsterdam , general principle and limit on ground of public or private interest govern this right of access to document shall be determine by the Council , act in accordance with the codecision procedure with this Parliament , on the basis of a proposal by the European Commission . </s>
as you know , any such proposal will have to be table in accordance with the provision of the Treaty of Amsterdam , that be within two year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , or in other word before 1 May @card@ . </s>
you will understand that , as the Council have , as yet , not receive any proposal from the Commission in this regard , I can answer the detailed point you have raise in your question . </s>
thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council . </s>
I be sure the President-in-Office of the Council be a very nice man and be very kind to his wife and his child and his dog . </s>
however , forgive me if I be a little sceptical of the reply you have just give me . </s>
I do not believe that the statement make within the Council and the vote be available to the public immediately . </s>
Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council have pass legislation , rather than wait for it to come out week later on a press release list . </s>
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ? </s>
Mr Newton Dunn , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comment with which you start your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refrain from make such comment in future . </s>
with regard to what you be say , it make me think that the criticism level at the Council , apart from be formulate in a very specific way of which we also take note , do not actually refer to the opacity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency . </s>
however , I would like to say , Mr Newton Dunn , that the result of this kind of process for transparency be quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable . </s>
we have no problem , Mr Newton Dunn , in repeat this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what have be say here , because that meet the requirement of the Treaty exactly . </s>
we therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council be at present make available to the public all essential information regard the Council 's function as a legislative body . </s>
I do not consider that the Council try to answer my question . </s>
I do not ask what the Council think of the proposal which the Commission have still not table . </s>
instead , my question concern the interpretation in principle of Article @card@ of the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
do this permit legislation also to be pass concern national law on transparency and not only in connection with the three institution of the European Union refer to there ? </s>
I should like to have an answer to that question . </s>
do the Council consider that , on the basis of Article @card@ of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulate , that be to say legislation not relate to the Eu 's institution ? </s>
Mr Sjöstedt , the answer that I give be the only answer possible . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to say that any interpretation of Article @card@ of the Treaty must also be link to the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
at the moment , there be no concrete proposal which would allow us to make adjustment under this article , and unless there be such a proposal , we can move forward on this matter . </s>
in any event , Article @card@ do not , at first sight , allow work to be do on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
I be , up to a point , concern about how the Council will fight for the principle contain in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose be to ensure that citizen have a good opportunity to participate in the decision-making process . </s>
How be this to be do when , at the same time , the Commission 's proposal - which have be leak , so the general public be aware of it - say that employee ' freedom of thought come before transparency and that it be not possible to have access to work document , report , draft etc ? </s>
do not the Council 's representative think that this make it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ? </s>
Mrs Frahm , the question that you raise be extremely important and we discuss it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
I would like to say that transparency do not only apply from the Community institution &quot; outwards &quot; , it also apply between the institution . </s>
by this I mean that there be aspect of the form and procedure of the Community institution ' working which be not accessible to the other institution , and not only as regard the Commission 's relationship with Parliament , but also as regard the Commission 's relationship with the Council . </s>
as a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue be raise and discuss on several occasion . </s>
the European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the matter be still open . </s>
genuine transparency of the institution ' working and the way they be present throughout Europe be an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , need to be study again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
we have no doubt about this and we think that the member take part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again . </s>
I believe that the Commission 's proposal should make provision for great transparency in term of the way the various institution function , but I think that there be always room for improvement in this matter . </s>
for our part , we be prepare to study any proposal make in this area . </s>
it be a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and other have ask . </s>
we have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthen democracy and ensure that there be a worthwhile dialogue between citizen , decision maker and authority . </s>
we be very anxious indeed that the Eu , too , should move in this direction , and this be also state in the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
One or two year ago , Parliament adopt a report by Mrs Lööw which be extremely important in this context . </s>
the report warn that the forthcoming process would lead to restriction upon the transparency of the Member States . </s>
we can now see that there be perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament . </s>
I want to ask the Council if it understand this warning , in view of what we have now see in the work document from the Commission . </s>
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , there be something we should all be aware of : there be not necessarily a huge gulf between the view of the Council and Parliament and between the view of the member of the Council and the member of this Parliament on the advantage or disadvantage of transparency . </s>
people sometimes get the idea that the Council be the place where issue be deal with in an opaque way and that Parliament be where they be deal with in a transparent way . </s>
this be not true . </s>
we share your concern about the way the institution operate and the effect that this can have externally . </s>
we therefore have the same concern and interpret fundamental principle in the same way . </s>
What may be true , Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , be that occasionally we do not have the same view on the exact way in which the transparency process itself may or may not work in term of genuine transparency . </s>
by this I mean that it be often dangerous to imagine that publish a certain kind of document or that ensure transparency in some of the institution be factor that will improve the democratic nature of these institution , because in reality this be frequently not the case . </s>
we know - and I do not want to go into this in any great depth - that when , on occasion , transparency exceed certain limit , we automatically end up with informal conversation and deal be make behind the scene . </s>
we must strike an overall balance on transparency and this balance lie exactly halfway between realism and rhetoric . </s>
I listen very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa have to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
my concern be , if I have understand Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting point he make as regard transparency and the IGC , whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
after all , examine the issue of transparency in the way the institution operate should never be hide away under any old head or confine to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobby . </s>
it should have its own head in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean widen the agenda . </s>
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency be naturally an issue of concern to the institution . </s>
this Intergovernmental Conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improve the way the institution operate , particularly take account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient . </s>
all of this must nevertheless be do whilst respect a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solution we may devise to achieve these three aim . </s>
it be obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
I can assure you that this be an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representative of the preparatory group for the conference . </s>
it must therefore be able to count on the support of the member of the European Parliament , who will surely rally behind this proposal . </s>
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up . </s>
it should nevertheless be note that we have just conclude the Treaty of Amsterdam , which be approve last May , and that there be a raft of implement measure on transparency which be still in progress . </s>
the question be whether it be premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency . </s>
my feeling be that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public be clearly concerned about it , and because it be link with the need to make the European institution accountable to the public . </s>
as far as we be concern , they will be . </s>
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter . </s>
question no 5 by ( H-0785 / @card@ ) : subject : proposal for a regulation lay down the total admissible catch for specific fish population for the year @card@ , and the case of anchovy in particular the late report from the International Council for the exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stock in ICES zone VIII be critical . </s>
have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assess the impact of transfer the Portuguese quota for ICES zone XI and X and CECAF zone @card@ to France ( @card@ metric tonne per year overfishing ) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stock and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stock and the possible social and economic impact on this fishery sector in the future ? </s>
do the Council believe that it be permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violate the originally establish Tac of @card@ @card@ metric tonne per year , give the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stock ? </s>
What measure do the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to take proper account of the critical state of anchovy stock , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ? </s>
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency be extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it broach an issue which concern Portugal in a positive way , and I shall explain how . </s>
the Council be aware of the critical level of anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refer . </s>
nevertheless , at the last Fisheries Council of @card@ , hold on @card@ and @card@ December , the Member States involve in this area of fishing , namely France , Spain and Portugal , consider that apply the precautionary principle which set a Tac reduce from 5 @card@ tonne to 2 @card@ tonne , as the Commission propose , be excessively cautious . </s>
a compromise solution be therefore reach in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risk , that be the species of fish be affect , and the socio-economic problem cause by fishing limit . </s>
this be achieve by fix the Tac at an intermediate level of @card@ @card@ tonne instead of the @card@ @card@ set in @card@ . </s>
it be also stipulate that this would be revise in the light of new scientific information on preserve specie , of which we hope to see example in the first six month of this year . </s>
as for the Southern stock of anchovy in ICES zone IX , the Tac be fix at @card@ @card@ tonne for the whole of @card@ as oppose to @card@ @card@ tonne in @card@ . </s>
fishing quota transfer between Portugal and France be reduce proportionally from 5 @card@ tonne in @card@ to 3 @card@ tonne in @card@ , for fishing in French water . </s>
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stock overall , over the whole Community fishing area . </s>
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , @card@ % of stock of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay be allocate to Spain and only @card@ % to France . </s>
without this transfer from Portuguese water , the level of the Bay of Biscay Tac would have to be multiply by ten in order to grant adequate catch to France . </s>
that be why I think that this be quite positive from Portugal 's point of view . </s>
this situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stock than the risk refer to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , which we also understand . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I must say that your comment have not satisfy me at all . </s>
I understand that Portugal be affect by this . </s>
however , it seem to go against all reason and intelligence that @card@ % of the anchovies , which , until @card@ , be be fish in the Portuguese fishing ground , through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France , should now be fish in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wish to maintain that this have no effect on the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea . </s>
it have be show , as we have be claim since @card@ , that this move be appalling , and , if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement , that be fine by us , but these anchovy should be fish in Portuguese fishing ground and not in the Bay of Biscay . </s>
today , scientific study show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay be in danger of extinction , and now there will be measure to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fish in that Bay . </s>
I do not know if you be aware , representative of the Council of Ministers , of your responsibility over these last few year , and in @card@ as well , for the plight of the family who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular . </s>
I would like to say , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , that in its judgement of 5 October @card@ , the European Court of Justice rule that this transfer , which be approve , be in accordance with the principle lay down in Council Regulation @card@ / @card@ / @card@ and , specifically , with its Article 9 ( 1 ) , which stipulate that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing right that they have be allocate . </s>
the Court also state that the principle of relative stability have not be violate since the anchovy quota allocate to Spain in zone VIII have be maintain at @card@ % and France 's at @card@ % . </s>
apart from this , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Court be of the opinion that the transfer effect between Portugal and France do not violate the principle of exploit living sea and freshwater resource in a rational and responsible way , on the ground that the fishing pressure in zone VIII and IX neither increase nor adversely affect the overall quota of these resource allocate to Spain . </s>
accordingly , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Council reiterate its opinion that without this transfer , great account would be take of France 's possibility for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay . </s>
the Council therefore reiterate its opinion that fishing pressure would be great and more damaging to population number than the solution which be eventually choose . </s>
in concrete term , 3 @card@ tonne represent @card@ % of Portugal 's fishing opportunity in @card@ against 5 @card@ tonne or @card@ % in @card@ . </s>
these number represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council , a real improvement in term of conservation in comparison with the level of @card@ % lay down in Council Regulation @card@ / @card@ . </s>
question no 6 by ( H-0788 / @card@ ) : subject : measure to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romany in Kosovo on 2 December @card@ , NATO 's Defence Ministers make a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo 's minority community . </s>
in its resolution refer to specific atrocity commit against Serbs and Romany , Parliament also vigorously condemn the continue violence against the Serb population and call on the leader of the Kosovo Albanian to fully respect UN Resolution @card@ . </s>
the resolution also stress that previous persecution of the Albanian can constitute a pretext for killing , abduction , detention , intimidation , arson , looting , destruction of property and the taking-over of house etc . </s>
in the light of the above , will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo , as request by Parliament ? </s>
What other practical measure will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ? </s>
Mr Alavanos , I would like to say that I have the great sympathy for the concern underlie the issue you have raise . </s>
we genuinely share your concern about the threatening situation which exist in Kosovo for ethnic minority , for both the Serb and Romany population , and the incident of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region . </s>
the Council have always stress the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrate such act and of those who continue to perpetrate such act . </s>
the Council once again reiterate the need , in its December conclusion , to fully implement Security Council resolution @card@ / @card@ and have consistently support Bernard Kouchner 's effort to implement measure to guarantee effective protection of minority in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measure facilitate the preservation of the region 's multi-ethnic make-up be effectively implement . </s>
in our contact with senior political figure amongst the Kosovo Albanian , we have stress - and the Portuguese Prime Minister do this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population , the Romany population and other ethnic group be totally unacceptable . </s>
it will not be tolerate , and must stop immediately . </s>
it have be communicate explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leader that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minority be treat . </s>
I think that this be an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlie the European Union 's position , be be maintain by the Council and will continue to be maintain . </s>
we have fully support the effort of the United Nations mission and the international security force in Kosovo to prevent further outbreak of violence against minority and to protect the population under threat . </s>
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main task to be prevent any form of maltreatment on the ground of a person 's ethnic origin . </s>
the Council therefore express its satisfaction , in its December conclusion , at the substantial contribution announce by the European Commission , which will indirectly assist in return the situation to normal , together with similar contribution make by Member States . </s>
nevertheless , Mr Alavanos , the Council be also aware that the total amount of resource make available to the appropriate international organisation in Kosovo do not match the desire amount , in term of what the various Member States have be able to raise , and this have limit the real ability of these organisation to act on the ground . </s>
we shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authority and of the organisation represent Albanian in the region also depend on the ability of these organisation to prove themselves capable of implement measure which will guarantee the region 's multi-ethnic nature . </s>
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council . </s>
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal , its former president , Mr Soares , and its government , maintain a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombing in the Balkans . </s>
today 's political statement on this issue be very positive indeed , and one which I welcome . </s>
however , there be some concern over the lack of progress make despite the good and honest intention express by the European Union . </s>
unfortunately , we have recently witness the eradication of Serb , Romany , Turkish , and Croatian minority in Kosovo and we be now wonder what will happen next . </s>
the United Nation 's , and Mr Kouchner 's , mission in Kosovo end in failure . </s>
this failure be illustrate by the fact that after an entire war that be wage to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side . </s>
and so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intend to take more specific action to debate these issue with Mr Kouchner , who have a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today . </s>
Mr Alavanos , I can agree with what you just say in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner 's responsibility , and I would like to make two very important point here . </s>
the structure be implement in Kosovo be under the auspice of the United Nations . </s>
it be a structure to which the European Union have give as much support as it can and to which the country of the European Union have contribute in various way . </s>
There be one thing , however , that we can deny , and that be that Mr Kouchner 's effort to return Kosovo 's internal situation to normal have be extremely positive . </s>
this be undeniable , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the result of these effort , for reason beyond Mr Kouchner 's control , have not be as effective as we would all have like them to be . </s>
I have one last point to make , which be about the European Union 's responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which have overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo . </s>
therefore , the responsibility of the European Union have to be see in a certain context . </s>
it be the international community , and specifically the United Nations , which should be hold responsible for implement Resolution @card@ / @card@ and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality . </s>
these be question which we should all be ask , but the forum for put these question be the United Nations . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily welcome the fact that you have say that you wish to improve structure , in the aim of improve the credibility of the authority . </s>
I think that we need to consider how we can well present this to the general public . </s>
the question which I therefore ask myself be this : have in fact a start be make on how we can promote the medium in this area , how we can train journalist and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ? </s>
we have endeavour to provide material help . </s>
we have try to defend peace by take military action . </s>
What be the situation now as regard effort to include psychological criterion in this crisis area and provide the well possible support here ? </s>
Mr Rübig , as I say , I understand your concern very well . </s>
I think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few month , there have be some positive development in term of the resource that will be available to Mr Kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently . </s>
I hear Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue , and I think that many of the concern he express then about the lack of resource need to overcome some of the problem have now be address . </s>
in other word , he have be give these resource . </s>
There be two fundamental question in particular . </s>
firstly , an increase in police number would be an important factor in guarantee the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protect certain section of the civilian population . </s>
secondly , an increase in appropriation would allow some official who have important role in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be keep on . </s>
the issue which we should all raise , and I do so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concern the very substance of Security Council Resolution @card@ / @card@ . </s>
I know that this be an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be question the logic behind this resolution and its chance of be implement . </s>
we advocate that it should be implement in its entirety . </s>
nevertheless , we must look at this resolution , and this be also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later . </s>
we will have to do so because , as have happen in the past in other context and in other strategically important situation across the world , we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process , and a certain kind of logic and balance - which be in fact the logic and the balance which lead to this resolution be approve - should be maintain in future . </s>
What we have to do , and we in the European Union be already do it , be to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resource , and you be right , Mr Rübig , we have a duty to our citizen to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resource be be properly use . </s>
we in the Council will be try to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you . </s>
the problem be not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he be work , namely Resolution @card@ . </s>
have say this , the Eu 's responsibility , which be both yours and ours , be to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution @card@ and devise a future scenario for the whole region . </s>
it be the failure to define this scenario which be cause or encourage the excess , accident and assassination mention by Mr Alavanos . </s>
do the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ? </s>
if so , do it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region , avoid as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States , as have tend to happen elsewhere , and reunite the party , in this case Kosovo and Albania ? </s>
Mr Dupuis , there will obviously be no attempt by the Council to work towards a change in the status of Kosovo outside the framework establish in Security Council Resolution @card@ / @card@ . </s>
I would also like to say that the way in which this issue be address in the Security Council raise another quite interesting question , which be how the European Union be represent on that Council , and therefore , to what extent the European Union 's representation on the Council follow our rule on external policy and common security . </s>
however , it would probably take us more than one parliamentary sit to discuss this . </s>
I would nevertheless like to say that we know that the situation in Kosovo be also closely connect with that of all the country and region surround it . </s>
the situation in Kosovo will not be resolve in isolation . </s>
it will be resolve when there be stability throughout the region . </s>
this lead , of course , to the measure be take within the European Union , both in term of stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and in term of the new contractual relation which we be try to establish with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . </s>
There be also the raft of positive measure which we be try to implement together with Albania , in addition , of course , to the pressure we be put on the Serbian authority , specifically the support we be provide to Serbian town with democratic structure , through the &quot; Energy for Democracy &quot; project . </s>
these action , take together , and as a result of the synergy between them , may also create a framework for resolve the situation in Kosovo . </s>
the situation in Kosovo itself will not be resolve unless there be an overall plan for stability in the region . </s>
since the author be not present , Question no 7 lapse . </s>
question no 8 by ( H-0796 / @card@ ) : subject : New INTERREG Initiative in point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitle : promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the Commission authorise for the renovation and development of historic urban centre use a joint cross-border strategy . </s>
however , housing be specifically exclude . </s>
give the fact that there be many house in rural area which be of historic interest , include small cottage , and , give the need , for a variety of reason , to maintain rural population and to attract people to rural area , do not the Council agree that these objective could be assist if housing project be fund in the area cover by INTERREG ? </s>
Mr President , the Council and , I think , the Portuguese Presidency in particular , be extremely aware of the importance of the problem Mr Gallagher 's question raise and I would like to say that we have always pay the utmost attention to Community policy for the development of rural area . </s>
I would like to point out that in May @card@ we adopt a new system for support rural development which be the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development . </s>
this be , as you know , one of the change make during the agenda @card@ negotiation and it change the way in which agricultural issue be deal with at Community level . </s>
through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund , the EAGGF , this Community support framework be design to help reverse the trend of abandon rural area , an issue you be quite right to raise . </s>
on the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ERDF , also contribute as part of its role to promote social and economic cohesion , by redress the main regional imbalance and encouraging rural area to take part in development and conversion . </s>
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contribute to promote sustainable rural development and to create sustainable employment in rural area . </s>
this combination of instrument enable us to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , be one of the way in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimension - and regional policy also , have develop and change . </s>
we think that this be one of the most fundamental issue within the concept of multifunctionality which be now associate with change in the common agricultural policy , and the EAGGF , of course , have a crucial role to play in this . </s>
question no 9 by ( H-0798 / @card@ ) : subject : farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priority of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six month as regard the common agricultural policy and indicate the step it feel be necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sector and product adversely affect by recent health scare ? </s>
your question on the common agricultural policy be one which we take very seriously and which should always be consider in this House 's discussion , because in the future we be likely to discuss this issue at great length . </s>
during the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continue discussion on the cap , by adapt some of the common market organisation with a view to develop the Union 's rural area in an appropriate way and guarantee an improvement in farmer ' income , pay particular attention to measure which could have an impact on small family-run farm . </s>
on the other hand , the Portuguese Presidency will continue , if and when the new WTO round begin within its term of office , which be by no mean guarantee , to ensure that the presence of Community production on international market be strengthen . </s>
it will also continue to ensure a great balance between export Community farm product and preserve the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just refer . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency also attach importance to reinforce food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already refer to this aspect this morning . </s>
we think that the role of food safety , specifically in term of everything link to public health , be one of our presidency 's essential task . </s>
it be therefore one of the priority of our programme . </s>
we shall be develop it in four parallel scheme , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council . </s>
at the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June , the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission present in its White Paper a few day ago . </s>
we think that the task we now have of establish a European agency be crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabilise confidence in this market , to break down some of the tension between Member States in this area and even - it have to be say - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealing with third country in area of food safety . </s>
this be what we shall be try to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our effort to this House . </s>
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply . </s>
I be sure that he be aware of the very serious threat to the European model which be base on family farming , mainly those farmer involve in beef and sheepmeat production who be now expect to sell their produce at or below production cost . </s>
I would like to ask what new step the council can take to safeguard their interest in the forthcoming world trade talk , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economy of scale make competitive family farming for European farmer extremely difficult and where , of course , European standard of food safety do not apply . </s>
I completely understand your concern , and I feel that there be a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue . </s>
we also have to think of the consequence , especially in term of finance and compensate farmer . </s>
nevertheless , as you know , this issue be now in the hand of the European Commission and it will have to take this further . </s>
the Council 's ability to intervene in this matter be strictly limit . </s>
lady and gentleman , these question go to the very heart of the concern underlie the Portuguese Presidency 's programme and the concern of our government , which be behind this programme . </s>
the Council of the European Union be aware of the problem face by the homeless , of which , as you know , there be many cause , range from drug and violence against woman and child to long-term unemployment . </s>
it be an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon of social exclusion and of poverty , which the Council be attempt to combat in various way . </s>
in fact , there be so many cause that there must be a great variety of political initiative to address these problem as well as further debate , as there be in all of the area in which the Union intervene , and in line with all of the policy to be develop in this area . </s>
the first area in which there must be political action be that of combat violence commit by man against woman and child , which often cause woman to run away , either with their child or alone , which in turn may have serious consequence . </s>
it might also be violence commit by man and / or woman against child that make these child leave home , which today lead to phenomenon such as drug addiction , prostitution and so on . </s>
in order to combat these violence-related phenomenon , Parliament and the Council last December adopt the Daphne programme , which be an action programme design to combat violence against woman and child , and which will shortly come into force . </s>
this programme will support action carry out by NGOs in this field . </s>
at the beginning of May this year , the Portuguese Presidency will be organise a conference in Lisbon on violence against woman . </s>
with regard to combat drug addiction , I would remind you of the programme for the prevention of drug addiction adopt in December @card@ by the European Parliament and the Council , with the aim of promote a multi-disciplinary approach , which be to take particular account of the implication of this phenomenon for society and for individual . </s>
with regard to combat unemployment and social exclusion , I would like to remind you - and I think that various reference have already be make to this today , both by the President-in-Office and by various member - about Portugal 's initiative to hold a special European council at the end of March this year , specifically dedicate to the issue of employment , economic reform and social cohesion , all combine with an innovative and knowledgeable approach . </s>
One part of this initiative specifically seek to combat social exclusion . </s>
it also seek to encourage social inclusion by actively promote concrete measure and great coordination , both of employment policy and of the whole raft of policy which could guarantee an increase in European competitiveness , thereby increase the development of our own economy . </s>
this would have obvious consequence in term of our ability to remedy all of these negative knock-on effect which cause social exclusion and which be obviously link to poverty . </s>
still on the subject of concrete measure for combat social exclusion , we should remember that the European Commission announce that it will be propose a five-year action plan under Article @card@ of the Treaty , which seek to combat social exclusion . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency have already commit itself to start work on this as soon as it receive the Commission 's proposal . </s>
this , Mr Papayannakis - and I would like to remind you of my own participation in the last Intergovernmental Conference - be an issue that bring some European country together during that conference . </s>
we also achieve , if I may say so , the feat of bring it into the scope of the revise Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
I think that this be an issue which we should always bear in mind . </s>
it be therefore a key issue , which will enable us to show the public how useful Europe can be to them . </s>
if we do not do this , we will find it difficult to persuade them to take an interest in a great Europe . </s>
however , this be a problem which will outlive the six month of the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
we will do what we can in these six month . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber . </s>
but I do not think he answer my question with regard specifically to tackle homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisation actively involve in this field . </s>
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policy and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlie cause of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency . </s>
my specific question concern the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulty the President-in-Office allude to with regard to support at intergovernmental level . </s>
I feel this be one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in provide the conduit for exchange of experience and good practice among the Member States . </s>
Mr Crowley , with regard to the presidency 's scope for support action by non-governmental organisation , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problem face by the homeless , I would like to say that such initiative be welcome , and we be very much open to the possibility of support them . </s>
we have work closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiative they have propose within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we be combine with the wide range of concern underpin our whole programme . </s>
we have no specific , concrete initiative in this area but that do not mean that we be close to the idea that an initiative propose to us by NGOs in this area might be consider during our presidency . </s>
it should be point out that this can only be do within the Council 's scope for action . </s>
any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission 's right of initiative will obviously have to be do through the Commission itself . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have talk a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon , etc . </s>
however , you also say something which I find particularly frightening . </s>
you say that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development . </s>
I be begin to feel a little worry because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion . </s>
I do not see how you could , with the view that you hold , provide any answer . </s>
What I ask and what I be once again ask be the follow : what be the view of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example , the appeal make by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policy , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistribute wealth ? </s>
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intend to do something about these matter . </s>
you must understand that a presidency 's ability to reverse global social or economic trend during its six month in office be actually quite limit . </s>
I think that it be also obvious that our ability to act be link to the Commission 's own scope for intervene , through its right of initiative . </s>
I have speak about the special European Council and about Portugal 's initiative in convene it , and I have speak about the future , because there be two complementary way of see the issue of social exclusion . </s>
One of them be the series of measure which must be adopt immediately in order to deal with the specific effect of social exclusion . </s>
the second be to create internationally competitive condition , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union , and this will have positive knock-on effect on the problem of social exclusion . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency do not have a magic wand with which it can , in six month , resolve problem that have always exist . </s>
it be prepare to act on proposal by the Commission in any area for which there be community competence . </s>
it also have the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measure which may be present , specifically by non-governmental organisation , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which be traditional in these matter . </s>
we should , however , also bear in mind , Mr Papayannakis , that we can act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , arm only with the measure a presidency can propose in the space of six month . </s>
we therefore think that all the measure we have highlight in term of long-term strategy , regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the homeless may be dead , will help us to guarantee sustainable policy in the European Union . </s>
we will try to move these strategy forward as much as possible during our presidency . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0801 / @card@ ) : subject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priority of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy , the Convention of Lomé and tackle famine situation ? </s>
Mr President , the issue of European development aid policy have , over the last few year , undergo a marked change . </s>
I be think in particular of the whole debate in which we participate on renew the Lomé convention and on establish the new contractual framework which will succeed the Lomé Convention . </s>
I think - and I say this with the authority of someone who have be involve in the negotiation both on Portugal join Lomé III and in the negotiation on Lomé IV , as president of the Portuguese delegation - that these issue today be very confusing for the general public and especially for government , and I think that they must be also confusing for member of this House . </s>
How can we judge the real effectiveness of appropriation allocate to development aid in combat the negative factor they be suppose to address ? </s>
the Portuguese Presidency 's immediate priority will be to hold an informal meeting in January of development minister , the purpose of which will be to define a European strategy for development cooperation . </s>
we therefore think that it be extremely important , specifically within the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee and in the overall framework of prepare for the next Unctad , for us to be able to adopt a collective , organise position in order to have an idea of how the Union 's resource be be use for development aid . </s>
why should we do this ? </s>
because our own national parliament be concern , just as this Parliament need to be , at Community level , about the way in which these appropriation be be allocate and use . </s>
we be anxious to guarantee that these discussion be useful and productive and that they yield concrete result , chiefly as regard future action at international level . </s>
we also think that the new contractual model define for the Lomé Convention be a more responsible , balanced and efficient model than the one operate under the previous Yaoundé and Lomé Conventions . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would also like to say , as a Summit between the European Union and African country may yet take place , that these development cooperation issue and a general understanding of how development issue might be address in the framework of a bilateral relationship between these two zone will , of course , be paramount in our concern . </s>
it will also be one of the central theme of this agenda . </s>
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who speak to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outline the position . </s>
but there be some question still outstanding . </s>
There do not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme . </s>
the situation of AIDS in Africa now be so serious that more people be die of AIDS than be die in conflict . </s>
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue . </s>
medicine be available in the United States but the United States be not make them cheap enough for the people in Africa . </s>
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he be do about the situation that be develop in Ethiopia where there be drought , where the crop have fail , and where , in six month ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it be some year ago in Ethiopia with famine and people die in their thousand . </s>
at the same time , there be a war go on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armament industry in Europe be not short in send gun , after which we will send the bread . </s>
first of all , Mr Andrew , you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague 's speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development . </s>
There be no contradiction between our two position , quite the opposite . </s>
unless we wish to act like megalomaniac , we can in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situation relate to all the enormous issue we face , particularly in the area of external relation . </s>
as you can understand , it would be easy to do so . </s>
all we would have to do be get a directory of development and put all the item in our programme , one after the other . </s>
we be sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within government ' ability to act and within the scope of the Council . </s>
we must understand that there be limitation on what we can achieve , particularly in term of manage national indicative programme . </s>
you have mention Ethiopia , which fall within the scope of national indicative programme , but there be , as you know , several Community action to combat AIDS , and in this respect , you be right , and the United States will probably not do any well . </s>
indeed , in term of development aid policy , I think that Europe have absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compare very favourably with that of the United States . </s>
your question switch to the subject of arm , a broad policy issue which I do not think fall within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course , address in the future , if it see fit and if it decide to put it in a specific context . </s>
be the Council aware of the social problem cause by the export of food by the Eu to develop country at price below the cost of production ? </s>
do the presidency intend to do anything about this ? </s>
you have raise a long-standing problem in the field of food aid which be whether food aid might actually be damage agriculture in develop country . </s>
this be an issue which arise time and time again and for which , within the framework of development aid , no answer have ever be find . </s>
it be traditionally raise because in practice action link to food aid be often think to have a negative impact on the establishment of agricultural structure in these country , specifically in term of family-based farming . </s>
I have no solution for this and in my experience of more than twenty year of deal with these issue , I do not think that anyone else have either . </s>
since the author be not present , Question no @card@ lapse . </s>
with regard to the question ask by Mr Marinos , I would like , first of all , to emphasise that the Council be fully aware that the cultural dimension be without a doubt one of Europe 's great triumph and that we need to make every effort to safeguard our cultural identity . </s>
I think that these factor have play a role in the various position adopt by the Union in its external relation . </s>
an example of this be the way we have convey our concern within the World Trade Organisation . </s>
nor do the Council underestimate the importance of culture and sport in economic term . </s>
as this be the case , I would like to point out , Mr Marinos , that if the cultural dimension of European policy be to deserve the attention of the competent authority , this will have to be do with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity , take into account what have to be do at national level as well as at Community level . </s>
with regard to Mr Nogueira Román 's question on employment , I refer to what I say earlier : this issue be still of concern to member of national parliament and to national government , and it will , of course , occupy a central place in the Portuguese Presidency 's programme . </s>
some people even say that it be too high in the Portuguese Presidency 's order of priority , give that Portugal do not even have a very high level of unemployment . </s>
however , we shall be conduct our presidency with a European perspective . </s>
I think that the Lisbon European Council and the initiative to which I refer earlier meet this requirement perfectly . </s>
I believe , Mr President , that the issue you have put to me be connect with the question by Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Nogueira Román . </s>
on the subject of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , I would like to say that the Council can only refer you , gentleman , to the conclusion of the Cologne and Helsinki European Councils , which define the mandate for this conference . </s>
it should therefore continue to be the responsibility of the conference itself , which be an intergovernmental structure , to study how the issue you have raise could be incorporate into its work within the scope of its mandate . </s>
of course , the extensive support which the Portuguese Presidency be attempt to give to the role of the member of the European Parliament who will be take part in the preparatory group will enable them to speak about and channel this Parliament 's concern via this preparatory group . </s>
the President of the European Parliament will also have an opportunity to make progress in this area , at ministerial level . </s>
with regard to the rotate presidency , this be not an issue which the Portuguese Presidency intend to raise on its own initiative at the next Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
however , if anyone do wish to address this issue , we shall take account of that , and we shall table it for the conference . </s>
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he be on European affair . </s>
unfortunately , in my case , he do not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer . </s>
since the Council recognise the fact that culture be a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice . </s>
say that the cultural dimension be govern by the principle of subsidiarity and that it be therefore national government who be responsible be , I be afraid , just an excuse . </s>
my question , which have not be answer , be why , when the European Parliament be look to increase appropriation to fund cultural programme within the European Union , the Council and the Commission be cut back on appropriation and at time cut them out altogether . </s>
this be a true example of the Council 's indifference towards culture , despite its assurance to the contrary that it be a matter to which it attach great importance . </s>
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it be prepare henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it support banana , hop , cow and Indian hemp . </s>
Mr Marinos , we be not adopt a purely economic approach to manage the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension be , I be sure you will appreciate , one of our main concern . </s>
these cultural dimension , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that be the level of resource which can be call on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiative . </s>
this be a dimension which it be difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union , and especially within the framework of the Council . </s>
for our part , we shall be attempt to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural good and service and on activity in this sphere , because we believe that this be an identify feature which be crucial to the Union 's image and to the Union 's own particular identity . </s>
this be , and will continue to be , connect with development within the World Trade Organisation . </s>
as you know , both we and the Council have address this issue appropriately . </s>
in specific term , we have be able to find a common language in term of the mandate give to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiation , at which this will be a central issue . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the Portuguese Presidency will be pay very close attention to extend and enrich European audiovisual policy by adopt a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allay Europe 's main fear . </s>
we also intend to initiate a new debate , a more innovative one , on the issue of Europe 's film heritage , give that this must be one of the most important factor in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy . </s>
the Presidency will also concentrate on discussion about create a digital television system in Europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organise during the Portuguese Presidency , in conjunction with the Commission , in February @card@ . </s>
but , Mr Marinos , in the Eu context , culture be an issue which be repeatedly raise in connection with IGC agenda . </s>
if , by chance , it be possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what have be call the fifth negotiate box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggest , both by Member States , and by the member of the European Parliament take part in the preparatory group . </s>
of course , if consensus could be reach on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might eventually be progress . </s>
it remain to be see whether or not there be a consensus on this . </s>
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestion on this issue . </s>
Mr President , I join other in wish Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency . </s>
I notice that you say this particular issue be not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wish it , you would consider it . </s>
well , I , and my fellow @card@ British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it . </s>
I appreciate that it be a provocative question . </s>
it be mean to provoke because there be a very serious issue here that some country do not hold Eu law in the respect which it deserve . </s>
we have to find some way of put pressure on such country to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizen . </s>
I can think of a good way to do it . </s>
Can you ? </s>
the issue be whether the European dimension will become strong or weak as a result of be specifically integrate into the treaty . </s>
this be an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be address at IGC level and be an issue that only a special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue fall outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place . </s>
intergovernmental conference be a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree . </s>
it be therefore not out of the question that these issue , which crop up again and again , and which be pass from one conference to another , may be address . </s>
the problem face us at the moment be whether there be currently a consensus within the European union on this issue be include , particularly bear in mind that if one such issue be include , other issue of a similar nature will probably be add to the conference 's agenda . </s>
Mr Dimitrakopoulos have the floor for a procedural motion . </s>
I would ask him to be brief . </s>
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly . </s>
I like what Mr Seixas da Costa say about Father Christmas . </s>
in Spain they say a letter to the three king . </s>
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament have already send a letter to the three king through its report . </s>
now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the present which we have ask them for in our letter to the three king . </s>
as I suspect , it be not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate . </s>
we thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three king . </s>
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos have raise be an extremely important one . </s>
the problem be that in this case Father Christmas have to follow order and therefore he can only give present when he be authorise by other to do so . </s>
it be not the Portuguese Presidency 's job to hand out the present that everyone want , especially those that the European Parliament be ask for . </s>
after this interesting exchange of opinion , and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I would like to tell you that Questions Nos @card@ to @card@ will be reply to in writing . </s>
that conclude question to the Council . </s>
capital tax the next item be the joint debate on : the oral question ( B5-0004 / @card@ ) by Mr Désir and other , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax the oral question ( B5-0005 / @card@ ) by Mr Désir and other , to the Commission , on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax . </s>
madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , during the Asian crisis in @card@ , as with those which hit Mexico in @card@ or the EMS in @card@ , everyone could see the damage cause to the economy of entire country by financial speculation , particularly currency speculation . </s>
between EUR 1 @card@ and 2 @card@ billion be trade every day on the financial market . </s>
in three or four day , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global GDP , of approximately EUR 6 @card@ billion . </s>
the bulk of these financial transaction be purely speculative and do not involve any trade in good or investment . </s>
yet the erratic movement of these massive sum of capital can , in a few hour , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunge its whole population into recession . </s>
in view of this situation , renewed interest have be express in the proposal by James Tobin , winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics , to create a tax on currency transaction . </s>
the rate of this would be very low so that it do not affect trade in good or investment , but it would act as a light brake on the wheel of speculation , thereby check the multiplication of short-term transaction . </s>
note that this propose tax , which seem to be produce strong emotion in some people , would be the low tax in the world and the low in the history of global taxation . </s>
yet it would represent the recapture of the area seize from democracy by the financial sphere . </s>
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaign by NGOs such as ATTAC , SOLIDAR or other which have popularise this proposal , be that it would release resource which could be allocate to development programme in the poor country , in area such as education or health . </s>
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there be both increase wealth and increase poverty . </s>
Many personality and institution have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President , Fernando Cardoso , the Finnish government , the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in @card@ . </s>
this question have be debate in several national parliament of the Eu . </s>
the common response have be that this tax could not be apply solely at national level and that the right platform for tackle this be the European Union . </s>
this be the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have table with @card@ other member . </s>
I be delight with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reach with the GUE / NGL , Greens / EFA , ELDR and PSE group . </s>
this motion ask the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six month on the feasibility of this tax . </s>
it also ask for an examination of the pressure and financial sanction which could be apply against country which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax haven . </s>
One of the most common objection be that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be say of any tax . </s>
if this argument have be accept in the past , then no taxis would ever have be create . </s>
the motion also ask that a position document , draw up by the Commission and Council , should be submit before the next annual meeting of the IMF . </s>
the European Union must take the initiative and must also , as demand in the motion , propose this initiative to the G7 because it be primarily a political question . </s>
if the Union take the initiative , this will have a ratchet effect because this debate be occur all over the world , include in the USA and Japan . </s>
a desire be be express everywhere with increase force that the world should not be rule by trader but by the people , their parliament , their government and their democratic institution . </s>
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I be extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question be now on the agenda of European construction . </s>
madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject . </s>
the Council have not yet discuss the possibility of introduce a tax on movement of capital as Professor Tobin suggest . </s>
this be a creative initiative , which we know have be welcome by different industry across the world and by various side in European politics , but the Commission have not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue . </s>
as it fall to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council have not yet be able to adopt a position on this issue . </s>
madam President , the revenue basis of the Tobin tax be say to be make up of very short-term exchange transaction . </s>
such transaction , accord to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variable . </s>
this have also just be underline by Mr Désir . </s>
therefore , accord to proponent , such as Mr Désir , an internationally apply Tobin tax would , in principle , reduce speculative transaction and , hence , the volatility of exchange rate , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity . </s>
take into account the considerable volume of short-term financial stream , even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sum of tax revenue . </s>
in reality , the motive underlie the increase interest in the Tobin tax and other source of international finance in the mid-nineties be non-economic . </s>
indeed , it be fuel by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programme at a time when demand for such fund be rise quickly and funding be increasingly hard to come by . </s>
the Commission recently observe renewed interest in a global tax , such as the Tobin tax , as a means of achieve socially responsible globalisation , so to speak . </s>
Mr Désir too have mention this grow interest on all side . </s>
but if the Tobin tax be to be apply unilaterally in order to prevent attack on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market . </s>
put more strongly , in the long term it be possible that for large number of fund , the Tobin tax will be evade by shift foreign exchange rate transaction to off-shore tax haven . </s>
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity . </s>
so the Tobin tax can only be effective if there be a sufficient number of industrialise country which be prepare to participate . </s>
finally , even if the Tobin tax be design to curb speculation with currency , there be still the risk that even non-speculative stream would be affect , and that be not the intention . </s>
for the reason set out above , I can see a good reason for introduce a European Tobin tax . </s>
at any rate , the Commission be against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union . </s>
in more direct term , to the extent that this measure could be deem an indirect restriction on capital stream , this would contravene the Treaty of Rome . </s>
the correct speculative approach , it seem to me , be to remove the real cause which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempt to suppress its symptom by introduce obstacle to the operation of the market . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to say a few word on the modus operandi and the ideological tactic behind this oral question . </s>
also because I know how many social democrat in this House share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy expert . </s>
we know what the problem be : instability on the market as the result of speculation . </s>
but the people ask the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner have just so impressively tell us , be the result of speculation . </s>
the Tobin tax would not have be able to prevent the crisis in the EEA in @card@ and @card@ or the crisis in the south-east Asian currency in @card@ . </s>
the initiator of this question do not propose a solution ; instead they be call for a new burden , they be call for more bureaucracy , for a measure which run counter to the market mechanism and they be take up plenary 's time with an intergroup opinion which exclude the competent parliamentary committee , contrary to several resolution by Parliament . </s>
in my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question be ideologically motivate rather than solution-focused . </s>
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reason . </s>
why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ? </s>
first , and the Commissioner have also confirm this , because it place a heavy burden on the capital market . </s>
even a small tax would have serious repercussion on the capital market , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investment considerably . </s>
in addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial market and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which be one of the central tenet of the internal market . </s>
secondly , speculative capital be extremely difficult to identify . </s>
thirdly , unless they be introduce in all country at the same time , tax measure be easy to circumvent because there be otherwise too many loophole . </s>
fourthly , technically speak , this measure be highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control . </s>
the measure which we should be take be part of the resolution before us here today . </s>
we need strong banking supervision . </s>
we need to clarify the liability for transaction . </s>
we need a framework of regulation at international level . </s>
we need to examine national law in order to check that they comply with the rule of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rule can be step up . </s>
I have a serious problem with one of the central point of this resolution which we can accept as it stand . </s>
I refer to point 9 . </s>
have listen to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission 's knowledge of the fact will result in a ' no ' to the Tobin tax . </s>
if the knowledge of the fact and this debate and the argument be as we say , and I think that they be right , then to take up another six month of the Commission 's time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital market would be irresponsible . </s>
the capital market do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which be why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote . </s>
madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial action be not a new one . </s>
we have be discuss the Tobin tax proposal for twenty year and yet the question be still topical because we need really concrete and honest answer base on careful study . </s>
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transaction really be . </s>
this question have now enter a different dimension , a dimension in which USD 1 @card@ billion roam the world twenty-four hour a day look for attractive investment , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy . </s>
we be concern about stability on the financial market , not for the sake of the financial market , but because this have to do with own growth , our own investment and our own job in the European Union . </s>
we must ask what instrument we can use in order to create the order here which have be miss in the past . </s>
we have do everything to help liberalise financial transaction , but so far we have have no work set of rule , as we have learn from the bitter lesson of the repercussion of the Asian and Latin American crisis . </s>
it be therefore high time that we think both about supervisory regulation and about transparency on the financial market and their information . </s>
it be important that we know who the actor be and what their credit rating be . </s>
we must also ask if there be not a need for fiscal justice . </s>
at a time when the tax burden on the work factor be increase throughout Europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that include the question of how to tax short-term financial transaction . </s>
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusion from the Commission , so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieve real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in make the economy and the financial market more stable and secure . </s>
this be the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedure of report from committee and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal . </s>
madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which , although it do not mention it in the text , appear to be an attempt to revive , as the introduction have do , the issue of the tax propose some year ago by Mr Tobin , which our Group oppose , clearly and totally , during the last legislature , with a series of argument clearly and coherently express by our President , Mr Cox . </s>
I will have to repeat these argument , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue have arise once again . </s>
we do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aim which Mr Tobin present at the time and which the leave in this House wish to revive . </s>
firstly , there be no evidence that the tax on international capital movement could reduce the danger of volatility and instability in the international market . </s>
on the contrary , since it be certain that not all country would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial service operate on an international level . </s>
furthermore , the idea of obtain resource to apply them to the more economically needy country present such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appear simply impossible . </s>
this be a false debate whose aim be purely political , and have no basis or technical viability . </s>
furthermore - since we be in this European Parliament - if we have still not manage the slight agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measure propose by the Commission within the European Union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ? </s>
I suppose that the first thing they say will be , ' let us see whether you be capable of reach a fiscal agreement within the Union ' . </s>
however , the Liberal Group have not want to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accept a joint motion for a resolution propose that a study be carry out on the possibility and suitability of impose this tax on certain area of international capital movement . </s>
I be sure that this study - if carry out objectively , with knowledge of the financial market and their mechanism on an international level - will show that it be neither suitable nor possible , not only in term of its application , but also as a means of achieve the propose objective . </s>
in itself , globalisation be positive . </s>
the economy have never grow so much nor favour so many country on a global level . </s>
this be due to progressive open up and great freedom in the international trade in good and service and also a great capacity for adequate movement of capital . </s>
any analysis of economic development in recent year , if objective , will show , through the figure , that they have no political colour or orientation . </s>
as I have say , we be not oppose to such a study . </s>
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution point out , it be by mean of liberalisation and open up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of state and on a general level . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , the problem do not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature . </s>
as Mrs Randzio-Plath say , we must remember that the reason why certain member want to revive this question be because of the recent international financial crisis and their economic , social and environmental consequence which have be feel by all in some country . </s>
the main objective of this debate be to look at the instrument available to the international community for stabilise the international financial and monetary system . </s>
in this respect , Mr Bolkestein , the motion for a resolution can be separate from the issue of the Tobin tax . </s>
if you look carefully , this propose tax on capital be just one of several instrument aim at force international investor to behave responsibly on the financial market . </s>
secondly , the motion do not say that we want a solely European initiative . </s>
this be why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union , in other word the Commission and also the Council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation . </s>
There should be no confusion in this debate . </s>
as environmentalist , we do not want an excuse for a motion . </s>
although a study produce by the Commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available . </s>
we do need to obtain , from the Commission and the Council , in other word from each of the government form the Union , a clear , positive or negative , political stance . </s>
they must indicate whether they be ready to defend , within competent public body such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance , the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instrument need to stabilise the international monetary system . </s>
as for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short-term capital movement be specifically intend to play on uncertainty and to bet on change between currency or various short-term financial asset . </s>
this argument be therefore not relevant . </s>
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone have their argument . </s>
however , I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph @card@ . </s>
we clearly expect a political stance to be take with a very firm deadline of the preparation for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund . </s>
we therefore demand , if this motion be adopt tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what position they will take on this occasion . </s>
madam President , my Group be extremely delighted that this debate be take place today , particularly as we have spare no effort along with member of other group to bring this about . </s>
obviously we all have different approach which be demonstrate by our debate and the motion for a resolution table at the beginning . </s>
have say this , our Group be please about the step forward which the compromise motion represent . </s>
this invite the Commission to present a report within six month . </s>
the European Parliament can play its role by take the initiative , even if it do so timidly , on this subject . </s>
however , I agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 be challenge , this motion would clearly lose its substance . </s>
this debate concern a vital question which increasing number of people be legitimately raise . </s>
What be the respective place of people and finance in today 's economy ? </s>
USD 1 @card@ billion be the volume of money move every day in the world 's currency market . </s>
this represent over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in good and service . </s>
by put finance at the helm , this have reinforce the demand of profitability and toughen the operate condition everywhere . </s>
it have lead to a growth in merger , acquisition and company restructuring and to gigantic sum be raise with increase frequency on the financial market . </s>
unemployment and pressure on employee worldwide be increase . </s>
opening and real growth be be hamper and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital be threaten the economy of many country , to the point of collapse , as in Asia , Russia and Brazil . </s>
face with this neoliberal globalisation dominate by the financial market , demand , as our motion recognise , be develop from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulate a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world . </s>
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation pose by the lack of nearly one billion job and the need to make unprecedented effort in term of development and access to information . </s>
in this respect , all idea deserve to be consider , include the Tobin tax which be important , just like other form of transaction which may be envisage . </s>
this tax could help to check speculation without penalise the activity of the real economy . </s>
it could release new resource for investment in people and , at a time when the UNDP estimate the sum need to eradicate poverty to be USD @card@ billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drink water and satisfy health need . </s>
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics go global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbol of the political desire to recapture the democratic area seize by the international financial operator . </s>
the Commissioner have say that a minimum number of industrialise country would be need to achieve this . </s>
I would point out that the European Union be compose of a large number of industrialise country and , like Mr Désir and several other speaker , I feel that the European Union which we be form can take the initiative in this respect . </s>
in any case , the European Parliament would be honour to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone . </s>
madam President , I too be delight that we be have this debate . </s>
I only regret that it have be so long in come . </s>
we know that each generation have , over the course of time , blindly buy into what could be call a dominant ideology . </s>
this be a set of prejudice accept as such due to a general conformism , but whose dramatic nature can be see by subsequent generation . </s>
free trade and the constant worship of globalisation be now the dominant ideology or , rather , the big mistake of our fin de siècle . </s>
this ideology be as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridor of the Kremlin or , before that , the certainty , elevate to the status of a dogma , that the earth be flat . </s>
our world be now dominate by a single logic or , I could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work . </s>
with a figure for trade in good and service of FRF @card@ @card@ billion only be equal to the product of four day ' speculation , the financial bubble owe very little to the productive activity of individual . </s>
it be self-perpetuating in a world of ever high bid which constantly deny the humanity of man , the rich as much as the poor . </s>
yet it be the latter who , at the end of the day , be exclude from the majority of the world 's decision-making centre for these be monopolise by a tiny minority refer to recently , and very aptly , by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites . </s>
it be natural that these élites would exclude any political concern from their field of manoeuvre , thus protect themselves from any democratic control and basically manage to be both illegitimate and irresponsible . </s>
however , the people be fight back , as demonstrate by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit . </s>
the leader of the world , head unfortunately by the European Commission , rush forward submissively , hope that their docility at the foot of the master of the world , Mr Clinton , would be enough to ensure them the scrap from the table . </s>
yet they reckon without the salutary reaction of the nobody , both individual and state . </s>
this reaction be more organise than previously , due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which be fight with increase support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transaction in particular . </s>
the creation of this taxation , of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type propose by Professor Lauré , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate . </s>
this be because it would basically mean that politics be regain a foothold in an area from which it have be exclude by operator whose profit be proportional to the degree of resignation of States . </s>
madam President , although some of the aim of the Tobin tax be fairly worthy of support , introduce the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union , as the first area of the world to do so , would sound the death knell for the European currency market . </s>
if the world 's other important currency trading area be to be exclude from the Tobin tax , the fact that tax be liable to be pay in Europe would lead to currency dealing move to those area . </s>
this have already be make clear a number time in this debate . </s>
it be not enough that all the world 's industrialise country should be include in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax haven outside that group of country . </s>
There should therefore be a universal application : it be not enough that the G7 country or the other industrialise country be involve . </s>
on the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speak , I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be bury . </s>
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regard how the tax revenue would be distribute . </s>
the world 's currency deal centre will hardly agree to the tax revenue be use , for example , for a variety of well-meaning , UN-backed purpose throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remain with them . </s>
with regard to the Tobin tax as a means of prevent future currency crisis , it have to be realise that the cause of a currency be overvalue can be avert through taxation . </s>
for that reason , as Mr Karas also say , we should give more attention to the policy that lead to a certain currency be overvalue in relation to its actual potential value . </s>
this again would require measure to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policy in this way . </s>
although it seem a reasonable scheme , the Tobin tax be not without its problem , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which I do not believe there will . </s>
it have to be remember that money at present be first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital . </s>
for that reason , the uninterrupted flow of asset in massive volume between the world 's financial centre be not merely speculative activity , which have nothing to do with the real economy . </s>
if this ' feedback ' mechanism , which give user the opportunity to make choice , be hamper by measure such as the Tobin tax , mistaken decision might be make that turn out to be so costly in term of the economic consequence that the tax would never be able to make up for it . </s>
hence , as Mr Karas have state to his credit , our Group be resolutely oppose to the introduction of the Tobin tax . </s>
madam President , I speak as someone who be in support of a tax on speculative capital movement across currency border . </s>
it seem to me blindingly self-evident that some action be necessary . </s>
in the last @card@ year , the volume of currency transaction have increase by @card@ time : firstly , total global reserve of all central bank barely amount to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real good and service equal just three-and-a-half day of foreign exchange market out of @card@ , that be , 1 % of capital movement be for trade in good and service and @card@ % be for speculation . </s>
the size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange market have make it hard and hard to manage national and regional economy . </s>
computer-control selling programme turn a random blip into an avalanche , bury job , life and industry across the globe . </s>
the only argument against it be : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzy we have see that have destroy job throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America . </s>
Mr Chirac have describe those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy . </s>
What be necessary be to throw some sand into the wheel of the currency speculator , stockbroker and option trader . </s>
of course , this can be do in one country ; it can be do within the single currency area , but it could be do at international level with global cooperation . </s>
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block . </s>
I be disappoint in the Epp . </s>
I think at least they read the resolution they be go to vote on . </s>
yes , I be in favour of such a tax , but it be not what we be go to vote on tomorrow . </s>
What we be go to vote on tomorrow be to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what step and what condition would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax . </s>
equally I understand the Commissioner fail to endorse such a tax , but I can understand why he fail to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue . </s>
There be nothing so close as a closed mind . </s>
the tax have the support of @card@ % of the people in the UK , accord to a recent survey by War on Want . </s>
in France it have have enormous resonance , particularly when link to a demand to use the proceed to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty . </s>
this issue can no longer be ignore by Parliament , the Council or the Commission . </s>
There be now a weight of public opinion demand an answer more sophisticated than : &quot; it have not be do before &quot; . </s>
in the new millennium , with new global problem require new global solution , they need to give good argument why it can be do now , rather than why it have not be do in the past . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flow would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rule . </s>
I have two or three point to make in this respect . </s>
One of the main demand of the demonstrator in Seattle be , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this be not by chance . </s>
the proposal of this tax today send out a strong signal from the rich European country prove that they want to move away from the culture of egoism . </s>
Everyone feel that this kind of joint tax be a virtuous measure which do not prevent trade but be aim primarily at speculation and its perverse effect . </s>
the member on the right should note this . </s>
it symbolise the need for solidarity with the country of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which question us extensively on this subject in Seattle . </s>
in order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply release by such a tax must be redistribute among the poor country . </s>
this be how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rule and show solidarity with the people of the south . </s>
madam President , we can just keep repeat the number which several previous speaker have quote ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that @card@ % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sale have an investment term of no more than eight day . </s>
we can maintain a situation in which investment and the creation of job be less lucrative than short-term sale of foreign currency and share . </s>
we can maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action . </s>
we can maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activity increase more and more quickly . </s>
it have be demonstrate in Germany that income from monetary asset have almost double from @card@ % of overall economic income since Tobin develop his idea . </s>
we can maintain a situation in which the poor country of the world be most expose to the speculative argument surround short-term currency fluctuation . </s>
nor do I believe that this be impracticable . </s>
why should it not be possible for the G7 country , the other Eu Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ? </s>
There must be an overriding economic interest . </s>
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiate , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transaction , all the so-called cash transaction , currency future and option ? </s>
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which do not jeopardise the long-term investment need by the economy but which finally make short-term and speculative investment unattractive . </s>
numerous very difficult question be bind to arise , but the only real problem which I can see so far be one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shift responsibility from one agency to another which have now take hold . </s>
madam President , we be not ask for more bureaucracy , as Mr Karas put it just a few minute ago . </s>
we be look for solution . </s>
of course capital market need clarity - that be actually the idea . </s>
the Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question . </s>
&quot; the more progress be make towards trade liberalisation , the more rule be need &quot; , as Commissioner Lamy say during the Millennium Round in Seattle . </s>
he recognise that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union 's construction be intimately link to a huge amount of new regulation . </s>
now that financing be readily available across national boundary without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day be employ in speculative transaction . </s>
we citizen of the world can afford the current rate of speculation . </s>
To continue would be economic suicide . </s>
Honourable member , Commissioner , it be often say that Europe have succeed in stabilise the economic sector , but this be only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector . </s>
if we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this fabled ' financial stability ' have be unsuccessful but that we be most probably sit on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment . </s>
the debt burden of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange security , the two main market stability indicator , have , for some time , be at danger level , as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrate . </s>
the fact that the public accept such rate and do not just abandon all financial activity in a panic can be explain by overambitious expectation over future gain . </s>
speculative activity be grow beyond measure and be , in turn , generate profit which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious . </s>
over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis . </s>
the danger be too great for us to ignore . </s>
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem . </s>
modern economic science have provide an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and other , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start . </s>
that be what we be lack , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackle speculation . </s>
no longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of , or for this fatalist approach towards , market force as adopt by the liberal - and I be sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm have leave - as this will only lead to its ruin . </s>
madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surround this debate be unbelievable . </s>
we need a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax mean . </s>
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it . </s>
that the right oppose taxis be quite understandable , except that they should never have be allow to spirit their million , or rather billion , into Switzerland . </s>
we all know that ! </s>
but now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transaction and undermine long-term project with long-term capital . </s>
it have never be do in south-east Asia , it have never be do in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria have leave the chamber , give Austria 's financial record . </s>
they be all tar with the same dirty brush ! </s>
we need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene . </s>
madam President , I be totally appall by the Commission 's , I. E. Mr Bolkestein 's , political ignorance ! </s>
he should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he be here at all ! </s>
madam President , I too have find part of the debate quite bizarre . </s>
it be perhaps not by chance that the Conservative bench have empty because that which be represent as market freedom no longer have anything in common with the noble principle of the social market economy which have bring so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decade . </s>
if we continue down this path , and this be the ideology , and declare the financial market to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the working of these market be contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportion . </s>
those who own the monetary asset be currently amass huge fortune which be again scream out to be reinvest . </s>
we have asset inflation of global proportion . </s>
as a result , speculative bubble continually arise on the financial market , cause grow economic instability which , in turn , jeopardise the entire economy . </s>
and it be precisely the medium-sized undertaking and large number of employee who suffer as a result . </s>
we can take action against this ; it be possible . </s>
the minimum requirement for this would be for a proper study to be carry out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe . </s>
that too be feasible . </s>
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandy about argument which be ask for trouble ! </s>
it be not correct that the Tobin tax be technically impracticable - it be quite feasible in the age of the computer . </s>
the fact that tax haven be frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European bank here at home must not be ignore . </s>
in short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steer towards situation which we experience on this continent time and again during the last century and which have catastrophic result . </s>
madam President , let us indeed tax money speculation : it do not produce anything new . </s>
the tax would be target at the right place : at the speculator . </s>
who be go to defend these speculator , when nurse and teacher be pay top rate of tax ? </s>
Article @card@ c of the Treaty establish the European Union provide scope for taxation on transaction . </s>
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing be in favour of those tax-recycling centre , the tax haven , of which there be @card@ in all . </s>
the Union should make a tax pact , which any country could initially be party to . </s>
the low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problem . </s>
it be strange to claim that if everyone be not include it would be impossible to bring into effect . </s>
the European Union be found through the effort of just a few country , and you see how we be today . </s>
the truth be the great problem be a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead . </s>
in the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power . </s>
lady and gentleman , we must challenge the monopoly the world 's speculative elite have on plan the world 's economy by remain outside the tax system . </s>
madam President , may I begin by extend a heartfelt thank to all speaker and , above all of course , Mr Désir , for the fact that this debate be take place this evening . </s>
whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it be evident that it be an important one . </s>
this be why it have be around for year , and it be satisfy that the Commission be be afford the opportunity this evening to give a response . </s>
I would like to start by underline two remark make by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gasòliba . </s>
he say that globalisation be a positive phenomenon , and I share his view . </s>
I believe that globalisation have help many country which , so far , have be on the sideline of the world trade stream to participate in these and be incorporate into the world trade system and , as far as I be aware , no country have ever be bad off by participate in international trade . </s>
in other word , as indeed already remark by Mr Gasòliba , globalisation be , in my view , positive , and I be of the opinion that it have contribute to a new international distribution of labour which have be pursue by many people for many year . </s>
a second remark make by Mr Gasòliba be that there be currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rate . </s>
I think that he be correct in this regard . </s>
I too be not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transaction would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rate . </s>
I be of the opinion that these be two important remark , and that be why I be reiterate them here . </s>
madam President , could I furthermore point out that none of the speaker this evening have draw a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European union on the other ? </s>
surely we be all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedom be the freedom of capital movement . </s>
madam President , I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consist partly of attempt , in conjunction with my office and colleague , to completely integrate the financial market within Europe , thus enable financial transaction to run as easily and smoothly as possible . </s>
in my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market , I be , in other word , oppose to all measure which hamper international financial transaction . </s>
you could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement . </s>
once again , the Tobin tax be , in my view , at odd with the Treaty of Rome , and this be an important , theoretical objection which have not be consider by any of the speaker this evening . </s>
madam President , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observation , there be also practical objection to the Tobin tax , as already underline by Mr Karas and other speaker . </s>
it have unfortunately be observe , I have to say , that the European Union have fail to reach agreement internally on specific tax measure . </s>
this indicate how difficult these dossier be . </s>
if we have not be able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partner . </s>
I think that this will be problematic . </s>
madam President , Mr Jonckheer have state that this could be one of the measure for stabilise the financial market . </s>
I think , however , that instability be merely a symptom and that we should be look at the underlie cause . </s>
I think that it be preferable to fight the cause rather than attempt to tackle the symptom when this be probably not possible and when , as already state , the measure concern be pretty certainly at odd with the Treaty of Rome . </s>
in order to remove these cause , one have to look at what be happen in the country in question . </s>
be it the case that these country can boast of what be term in English ' good governance ' ? </s>
be it the case that there be low inflation and that there be low interest rate ? </s>
that the market for production factor , include the labour market , operate flexibly ? </s>
that be not always the case . </s>
so if we want to look into what cause exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the element of good governance and focus on these first . </s>
in addition - and this have also be mention already , for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm , but also by other - there be a need for more supervision . </s>
more supervision nationally - supervision by national government of national bank - and internationally , for example by mean of the IMF . </s>
so I believe the good way to tackle the cause be by ensure , on the one hand , that good governance be observe in the country in question and that , on the other hand , there be more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapse . </s>
madam President , accord to various member of your Parliament , more funding should still be make available for major project . </s>
for example , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler speak in English about ' long-term capital for long-term project ' - this be an obvious issue . </s>
my reply to this be that , firstly , country should honour their pledge , namely make @card@ % of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation , so that a great deal more money become available than at present for such long-term project and via a route establish for the purpose , namely contribution to development cooperation , and not via an artificial and probably harmful route , namely the Tobin tax . </s>
madam President , I should like to leave it here . </s>
as far as the resolution be concern , of which I have see a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , base on this , determine its stance . </s>
I thank you for give me the opportunity to take part in this debate . </s>
I have receive four motion for a resolution , table pursuant to Rule @card@ ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
madam President , unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language . </s>
but I would be oblige if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which I think he can do at the same time as talk to Mrs Randzio-Plath . </s>
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ? </s>
Monsieur Bolkestein , Je veux vous dire quelque choose ! </s>
unfortunately , my Dutch be not as good as yours . </s>
but I would rather like to say something else to you . </s>
Parliament be not take the initiative and support a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission . </s>
we want to examine the possibility of introduce a Tobin tax . </s>
it will be just one of several instrument and hopefully you will be on our side in this . </s>
from a political point of view , I always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these thing ! </s>
it be not your job , it be our job to decide on that . </s>
it also have something to do with the newly awake self-consciousness of this Parliament . </s>
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less . </s>
we can do so without go off at other tangent . </s>
I respect you as a serious Commissioner who want to take his work seriously . </s>
Please respect us as member of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that include the Tobin tax ! </s>
madam President , an omission appear to have be make . </s>
in the list of table motion for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention be make of the compromise motion table jointly by the PSE , ELDR , Gue / NGL and green / EFA group and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux . </s>
Mr Désir , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution . </s>
if the service of the Presidency confirm that this be correctly table , it will be include . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place on Thursday at @card@ p. m. ( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) adoption of the Minutes of the previous sit Mr President , I simply want to pass on some news . </s>
There be a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid . </s>
someone plant a car bomb and one person have die . </s>
on behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist act . </s>
thank you , Mrs Fraga Estévez . </s>
we have hear about this regrettable incident . </s>
unfortunately , the terrorist murderer be once again punish Spanish society . </s>
I note your comment with particular keenness , as you may expect , give that I too be Spanish . </s>
( the Minutes be approve ) resumption of the session I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Friday , @card@ January @card@ . </s>
madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy . </s>
Two year ago , in Cavalese in Italy , an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cable of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceed safe limit , cause the death of more than @card@ European . </s>
since then , the victim ' family , who have not have the consolation of justice , since the pilot responsible have not face criminal charge , have be await solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least . </s>
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U. S. authority , and this be in order to uphold the right of the victim ' family . </s>
Mrs Angelilli , thank you . </s>
I have take note of your comment . </s>
agenda the next item be the order of business . </s>
follow a request to this effect , which I have receive from a number of political group , and follow the meeting of the conference of president which have just be hold , I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance , pursuant to Rule @card@ of our rule of Procedure , on the subject of the European Union 's reaction with regard to the talk in Austria on form a government . </s>
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduce by speech from Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission . </s>
be there anyone who wish to speak in favour of this proposal ? </s>
madam President , I would like to express my support for the decision of the conference of president , and , since I publicly criticise the presidency in January , I would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group , that we now find the presidency 's statement on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form . </s>
madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which be more in accordance with Rule @card@ of our rule of Procedure . </s>
this debate be topical , exceptionally important and urgent . </s>
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amend to include it . </s>
( applause ) be there anyone who wish to speak against this proposal ? </s>
madam President , I shall speak against this proposal on the ground of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the treaty , and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
madam President , until now we believe that the European union be , accord to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris found the European community , and subsequently the Union , an association of free , independent , sovereign state . </s>
even though many development cast doubt on this , we do believe , in spite of everything , that this be the case and , more recently , reference be make , albeit half-heartedly , to the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
well , patently , if we do open this debate today , Madam President , as you be request and as the conference of president be request , on the basis of Rule @card@ , we shall then be open up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national state and the free constitution of democratically elect government , enable some other majority in this Parliament , at some future time , to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it have assume power on the basis of free , regular , peaceful and democratic election within a Member State . </s>
if you ratify ... Mr Gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute . </s>
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure be observe . </s>
madam President , I think I have three minute . </s>
do forgive me . </s>
if you ratify this development , then you be ratify the development of the Union into a body which violate the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union . </s>
we have hear one speaker in favour and one against . </s>
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) this debate be therefore add at the top of the order of business . </s>
topical and urgent debate the next item be the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance . </s>
talk in Austria on form a government the next item be the debate on the talk in Austria on form a government . </s>
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , I have be request , on behalf of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union , to state our position to this Parliament on the current political situation in Austria and its consequence for relation between that country and the Union 's other Member States . </s>
first of all , I would like to make it clear that the statement make by the Portuguese Prime Minister on @card@ January , on behalf of three other country which be also Member States of the European Union , be make in this specific context . </s>
in other word , a common political position be adopt by the Heads of State and Government of fourteen country , which Portugal present on behalf of all of them . </s>
the text of this joint statement have a clearly define scope and purpose : the bilateral relationship between each of these fourteen country and an Austrian government which now comprise member of that country 's Freedom Party . </s>
let me remind you of what this statement say . </s>
1 - the government of the fourteen Member States shall not initiate or accept any official bilateral contact at political level with an Austrian government which include the Freedom Party . </s>
2 - Austrian candidate for post in international organisation will not have the support of these fourteen country . </s>
3 - Austrian ambassador in the Union 's capital will only be receive in the technical sense . </s>
I think that over the last few day , the reason which have lead the fourteen state support this statement to adopt it have become clear . </s>
basically , the view these state share of the political situation in Austria lead them to conclude that the possible inclusion in the Austrian government of a party such as the Freedom Party could bring about a change in respect for the common value which the Member States of the European Union be commit to safeguard . </s>
we be all aware of the public statement make by Jörg Haider and of some of the idea on specific policy that his party have advocate . </s>
I do not think that I need to remind you about his idea exonerate the Nazi regime , his attitude towards foreign and immigrant community , or to point out that this populist nationalism be reminiscent of another era . </s>
our common understanding be that this party 's position clearly run counter to the value that we hold to be fundamental to Europe and which in fact form the frame of reference which the Union have be promote in its external relation , both with regard to its forthcoming enlargement and in the context of its common foreign and security policy . </s>
it could be say that the present situation be a result of the people of Austria exercise their freedom of expression , which must be respect , and that any stand on this subject might be tantamount to interference in that country 's internal affair . </s>
first of all , Madam President , lady and gentleman , no one be threaten the existence of a democratic government in Austria or question the electoral reality behind the result of the recent election . </s>
those election show - and this also need to be emphasise - that the great majority of Austrian be still not in favour of Mr Haider 's party . </s>
What we regret , and take issue with , be the fact that the solution opt for give a share of political power in that country to a party whose leader have not give the slight guarantee that they will safeguard the fundamental principle Austria have commit itself to respect , defend and promote . </s>
Austria have every right to choose the government it wish , but we also have a right and duty to state our opinion on any political choice which we feel infringe Austria 's international commitment . </s>
today this apply to Austria , but tomorrow it could apply to any other country in the European Union . </s>
( applause ) let me repeat that point : this apply to Austria today and it would apply tomorrow to any Member State of the European Union . </s>
on the other hand , as we all know , human right , fundamental right issue , the great principle of democracy and of the rule of law , the rule for protect minority and combat racism , xenophobia and intolerance be no long issue to be discuss purely within a country . </s>
All the more so when that country belong to a community of state for which these concern represent the very heart of its project for civilisation . </s>
the Europe that we want to build and strengthen be not a purely economic project - it be a community of value and principle which may act as a base for political union and for the establishment of a great area of freedom , security and justice imbue with the value of solidarity . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , lady and gentleman , we therefore feel that we have the right and the duty to tell our Austrian friend , as other country outside the European Union have indeed do , that its choice of government will inevitably have consequence for our future relationship with them , as long as Mr Haider 's party form part of their government . </s>
as for the tangible consequence of this , about which the Commission 's statement yesterday give a few clue , the European Union will try to continue its work , whilst strictly respect the treaty and of course pay particular attention to the way in which the new Austrian government act . </s>
the Community framework be a special area , govern by very specific political and legal rule , which mean that it will also be give special treatment . </s>
we therefore want to ensure that the working of the Community machine be not affect by the current situation . </s>
( sustained applause ) Madam President , lady and gentleman , the Commission meet yesterday morning and as an independent body and with the joint will of all the member of the College , it make political decision of the utmost importance . </s>
it already state yesterday that it share the concern express by @card@ Member States of the Union , concern that have be reiterate here by the representative of the Presidency . </s>
today , on behalf of the entire Commission , I can repeat these concern before you . </s>
firstly , allow me to emphasise the Commission 's political role at time such as these . </s>
the Commission , like Parliament , be a supranational institution of the Union , and for that very reason it have no bilateral diplomatic relation with the Member States . </s>
it be precisely at time when the continuity , consistency and uphold of the value of the Union seem to be threaten that the Commission 's political role become strong and more apparent . </s>
let us not forget that the Treaty of Rome do not contain any clause provide for the voluntary withdrawal or the expulsion of a Member State . </s>
this be because the logic , the very assumption underlie the extraordinary achievement that be the European union be that when each state become a member of the Union , it accept its fundamental principle completely and forever . </s>
moreover , the treaty set out precise mechanism for ensure that these principle be respect . </s>
from this viewpoint , the Commission would not be perform its role properly if it be to interrupt the work relationship it maintain with Austria , and with every other Member State . </s>
lady and gentleman , when one of its member be in difficulty , the whole union be in difficulty . </s>
the duty of a strong supranational institution be not to isolate one of its member , but instead to permanently bind it to its deep-seated value . </s>
the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that this be do . </s>
on the other hand , it go without say that the Commission will continue to keep a close eye on event in Austria . </s>
indeed , the European Union would not survive without the principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right . </s>
these be the foundation of the Union . </s>
these principle be the raison d ' être of the Union and be the result and reflection of the formal commitment make by all the Member States to respect the right of individual and of people , regardless of their belief , origin or circumstance . </s>
these principle form an integral part of the rule of law , and the Commission , which be the guarantor of that rule of law , will be relentless in uphold them . </s>
we will bear down heavily on even the slight breach of the right of individual or of any minority . </s>
Europe , as a Member of Parliament from one of the applicant country say to me , be a union of minority , and as such , it call for everyone 's deep respect . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , allow me to make a few more brief remark . </s>
found over @card@ year ago , Bologna University , my alma mater , be the old university in the world . </s>
on the wall of one of its most beautiful hall you can still see the coat of arm of student and professor who choose that university , so many century ago , as a place of learn . </s>
There be over @card@ coat of arm from the whole of Europe , range from Transylvania to England . </s>
Europe already exist then : an area whose intellectual confine be unaffected by the frontier and limit of the politics of the day ; a community of shared value , ideal and knowledge . </s>
however , the fabric of European history have not only be weave with cultural interchange , the expansion of knowledge and the sharing of a robust core of common value . </s>
alongside the university coat of arm , there be war memorial in every small village or town in Europe , which bear witness to the tragedy of our continent . </s>
European history have be punctuate over the century by an unremitting sequence of war and conflict . </s>
Europe , a cradle of civilisation , have give rise to the most terrible atrocity ever know in human history . </s>
in recognition of this , as the first act of my presidency , I choose to visit Auschwitz , in order to say loud and clear , in the silence that be proper and fitting for such a place of memory , that Europe have not forget , and to repeat that the Europe of today and tomorrow be , can only be and will always be a union of freedom , law , security and peace . </s>
Freedom , law , security and peace : this be what the European Union be and what the European Union be . </s>
this be what the most extraordinary , bold and successful political achievement of the century that just end have be able to guarantee its citizen . </s>
this be what the unite Europe wish to offer , in the century that be now begin , to those who be prepare to join it . </s>
this afternoon , at this very moment , I should have be at the Université Catholique de Louvain to receive , together with the Prime Minister of France and the Director ­ General of the World Health Organisation , Mrs Brundtland , an honorary degree . </s>
I will be arrive a little late at that ceremony , but there be no more fitting way of honour a university which be one of the lead symbol of European learn than to come here , before Parliament , the supreme expression of popular sovereignty , in order to bear witness to my own passionate commitment , and that of the entire European Commission , to defend those principle which form the foundation of a unite Europe . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and of the European Democrats view the event and the discussion of development in Austria with alarm and disquiet . </s>
feeling have run high in our group 's debate - I freely admit this and regard it as a sign of how strong our group be - and no problem or issue have ever produce so many request to speak as there have be today in our group . </s>
I would like to thank all those who speak with such resoluteness of purpose . </s>
so as to leave you in absolutely no doubt on one point : the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and of the European Democrats be unite in its criticism of many of the statement make by the Leader of the FPÖ in Austria . </s>
we condemn the faux pas he have make in the last few day , especially those against the French President , Jacques Chirac , and the Belgian government . </s>
we categorically reject the thing he have say . </s>
we , the PPE-DE Group , champion human dignity , the state under the rule of law , democracy and freedom , and we defend these principle and value across the political spectrum . </s>
( applause ) the Christian Democrats , who form a key element of our group - and a great many people be probably unaware of this - evolve from the opposition to the totalitarianism of National socialism , which be every bit as inhuman , but also to the totalitarianism of those despiser of mankind , the Communists . </s>
( applause ) as the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and of the European democrat , we also represent today the value of the founding father of European unification - Robert Schuman , Alcide de Gasperi , Konrad Adenauer and Winston Churchill , and there be many other - and the value of the founder of Europe be our value , even today in the year @card@ . </s>
these principle be also the yardstick we use for assess the activity , dealing and word of the Member States and also the government to which we belong . </s>
at this point I would say : we have faith in our Austrian friend in the Austrian European People 's Party . </s>
( applause ) we must not forget that the European People 's Party , together with Alois Mock and Wolfgang Schüssel - one be the Minister for Trade and Commerce and the other be the Foreign Minister - be the party that do the most to pave the way for Austria 's entry into the European Union . </s>
we recall how in @card@ , which be not very long ago at all , everyone here in Parliament speak in positive term of the Austrian Presidency , and the conduct of Wolfgang Schüssel , the Leader of the ÖVP , here in this Chamber , speak of passion and commitment . </s>
the people of Austria have now vote and I believe we have nothing to gain from chastise the electorate . </s>
nor should we forget that there be in fact negotiation with the SPÖ . </s>
I regret that they prove unsuccessful , but why be this so ? </s>
because the trade union orientate part of SPÖ be not prepare to lend its support to the promise Chancellor Klima make ... ( Applause from the right , loud heckle from the left ) ... , to wit , a redevelopment programme for the economy and finance . </s>
that be the truth , and no matter how loud your protest , you can sweep this aside . </s>
we anticipate that a government under the leadership of the ÖVP , if it come to that , will represent and uphold the value and principle of our European people 's party , and these principle constitute an unequivocal declare belief in the dignity of all human being and in tolerance towards all human being . </s>
above all , they be the logical continuation of a policy of European unification , which the Republic of Austria have be pursue in an exemplary manner for decade . </s>
we will assess the Austrian government 's dealing , if it come under the leadership of the ÖVP , in term of the extent to which the state under the rule of law , democracy and freedom be guarantee , and we would expressly like to thank you , Mr President of the Commission , and the Commission as a whole , for not wait until today to issue an intelligent and balanced opinion in observance of the treaty of the European Union , but do so as early as yesterday . </s>
we be right behind you when you regard yourselves as the guardian of the treaty , and so let us tread this path together . </s>
this be what we expect and have to say as the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and of the European democrat . </s>
we want a Europe that uphold the rule of law , a Europe that embrace peace and tolerance . </s>
we do not want there to be isolation within Europe , rather we want to bring the people of Europe together , so as to enable the future of our continent in the twenty-first century to be one of freedom , democracy and peace . </s>
( loud applause from the PPE-DE Group ) Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the Party of European Socialists hope that this debate will send three message to the European public . </s>
let it be note that we be completely unite on all three count . </s>
firstly , we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the @card@ Member States , because we believe that this statement be in accordance with the common value , and not just the political force , which we have all build together . </s>
in any event , these common value be in complete opposition to those hold by the party ironically know as the Austrian Freedom Party . </s>
the Europe we be build be bear of the bitter experience we have all suffer , and the Socialist Group condemn the insult which have be direct at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian government , but also at the Socialists , who be European citizen as well , because , at the moment , the Austrian Socialists be be describe as traitor to their country . </s>
I will say one thing . </s>
for many year I be a traitor to my country ; at least that be General Franco 's view . </s>
President Guterres be also a traitor in Salazar 's eye , and that be something that I believe should also be state and defend by the PPE-DE . </s>
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , have act as a guardian of the treaty . </s>
however , I would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he describe the Commission as a European government . </s>
a government must have more nerve and more courage . </s>
that be what I be ask President Prodi for at this moment . </s>
( applause ) with all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler , and give that we have hear contradictory comment , depend on the translation , with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler , I would be very grateful if this point could be clarify in this House . </s>
secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people . </s>
this be an appeal to the majority of Austrian who have not vote for Haider , who have vote for the clearly democratic option , commit to Europe , and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have be Minister for Finance , but Chancellor Vranitzky also contribute to Austria 's integration process . </s>
we should not be so politically partisan . </s>
the accession of Austria to the Community be a joint venture . </s>
we all take part in it , not just one group . </s>
therefore , Madam President , I believe that it be our right and our obligation to ask the Austrian to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffer before in Europe , may not only harm Austria , but it may also spread , and I say this bearing history in mind . </s>
therefore , apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel have make , offer us all kind of guarantee , as do Chamberlain and Daladier in @card@ in Munich , I would like to know whether the PPE intend to implement measure in relation to the Austrian People 's Party , if it go ahead with this mad project . </s>
thirdly , if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance , I can assure you that we can forget the European Union 's main objective - enlargement - because , if we be Czech , Slovene or Hungarian , what would we say , face with a neighbour who judge us on racial ground and do not want us to enter ? </s>
I therefore think that this be a great day for European politics to commence . </s>
we support the Council and we believe that it be our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option . </s>
( applause from the PSE Group ) Madam President , my group welcome this debate because it be a define moment . </s>
this be the first time in the history of the modern European project that we stand at the threshold of see the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right . </s>
that be deeply disturbing . </s>
the FPÖ contend that if one read their literature and their programme , there be much in it that one could share . </s>
that may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we Liberal Democrats have with the Austrian FPÖ in our liberal International family . </s>
as early as @card@ , we have cause to believe that Mr Jörg Haider be not a man whose principle or attitude be consistent with decency and modern liberalism . </s>
in November of @card@ , after a long internal debate in Liberal International and many visit to Vienna to discuss issue , we suspend the FPÖ from membership and in July @card@ we expel them . </s>
we expel them then and we continue to reject what Mr Haider stand for now . </s>
let me share what we learn in that long experience . </s>
There be many in our rank who say &quot; read the text &quot; . </s>
There be many more in our rank who say &quot; read the subtext &quot; , &quot; look at the context &quot; . </s>
word in politics can be incendiary , can be inflammatory , or can be conciliatory . </s>
we find that Mr Jörg Haider , as a wordsmith , have be a voice for racism and for xenophobia . </s>
he be a man who play on fear and who have exploit vulnerability . </s>
that be why this debate be important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism , something profound be happen in Europe today . </s>
( applause ) I hasten to add that our quarrel be not with the Austrian people . </s>
we respect the right of the Austrian people to their own democratic process . </s>
we defend the right and constitutional prerogative of the Austrian people , but we here in the European Parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental value as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty - the value of freedom , democracy and respect for human right . </s>
every right-thinking person in this House believe that these be universal and indivisible without regard to colour , class or creed . </s>
we must promote and defend those right , all the while say to the people of Austria : our quarrel be not with you . </s>
I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it . </s>
it may not be an ideal initiative in term of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office , that it be root in idealism and for that reason we be incline to support it . </s>
I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty . </s>
article 7 talk about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breach of our fundamental value . </s>
we must find a way as institution to benchmark and give mean to this so that it have a reality and a substance . </s>
then we can work together by the Community method to root out this cancer within our midst . </s>
I want to say Madame President some word to Mr Schüssel . </s>
Mr Schüssel be a man with an honourable record in European politics . </s>
he now intend to ride into government on the back of a political tiger . </s>
Mr Schüssel - you be assume a very serious , personal , national and European responsibility . </s>
that responsibility , which you Mr Schüssel now take on , be to respect the letter and the spirit of the European treaty . </s>
finally , Madame President , this be a debate which touch on the heart of our democratic value and institution and call to mind that the price of liberty be eternal vigilance . </s>
on this continent , of all place , with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffer from in the past and at such great cost , we have to insist that today 's debate be not about interference with the sovereign right of a state . </s>
it be a dogged insistence by the democratically elect part of the institution of this union that we will not as Europeans countenance turn the clock back . </s>
( loud applause ) Madam President , the event take place today in Austria be extremely serious . </s>
for the first time , the European Union be face the possibility of have representative in the Council of Ministers and here among us of a party which obviously hold view and put forward legislation contrary to the value of the European Union . </s>
I shall make three comment on this matter , to illustrate the gravity of the problem . </s>
I believe , personally , that this be the first stage , if it do actually take place , in the inclusion of extremist in government become quite commonplace . </s>
I also believe it give an extremely negative political message to the vulnerable democracy which be candidate for membership of the European Union and which be go to join us . </s>
I feel , finally , that this be a case of political decline of the European union as such and it therefore also send a negative message outside the Union , when we be speak in the name of democracy and human right . </s>
some people have say that we be interfere in problem internal to Austria . </s>
some people have say that we be stigmatise the Austrian people and that we be effectively put word into the mouth of a future government . </s>
be it really put word into someone 's mouth , if we pay attention to what a political leader have be say for many year , when it show an obvious tendency to go against everything that we want ? </s>
we be not put word into someone 's mouth or stigmatise the Austrian people if we send a friendly message , say : friend , beware of what may soon happen in your country and what may contaminate the whole of Europe : not a radical change - I think Mr Haider be too intelligent for that - but a gradual erosion of democratic right , a slow erosion , by cultural contagion , and that be extremely dangerous . </s>
( applause ) let me thank you , Madam President , for your contribution on behalf of Parliament . </s>
it be both pertinent and politically intelligent . </s>
( applause ) I should also like to thank the Presidency of the Council for the firm , pertinent and moderate statement it have make . </s>
( applause ) finally I should like to address the party which , whether we like it or not , be the target of our comment : the PPE / DE . </s>
I would like to address Mr Poettering and also , indirectly , Mr Martens , a compatriot and former colleague . </s>
I have hear , Mr Poettering , that you have be follow event in Austria . </s>
I would rather have have you anticipate them and , particularly , condemn , on behalf of your party , the very principle of an alliance with people who practice verbal violence , who stigmatise the weak , who hold xenophobic view and who refuse to condemn the Nazi regime . </s>
( applause ) Mr Poettering , I do not doubt your concern for democracy but I believe that you be make a serious political mistake . </s>
and , to paraphrase one of my renowned fellow Belgian , one of the founder of Europe , Paul-Henri Spaak , I shall say that it be not yet too late for you , but now be the time to change your mind . </s>
madam President , in my group 's opinion , the European Union today face a political and ethical challenge which be without precedent since the creation of the Union . </s>
the European Union have certainly previously know situation where there be people in a Member State government whose idea and action be in contradiction to the guiding value of the Union . </s>
however , with Haider and his man , we would see the extreme right , openly racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic , promote to the rank of co-ruler of our community . </s>
go along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testify , albeit unwillingly , to the respectability of a political force which be not respectable . </s>
it would mean make the unacceptable commonplace on the scale of Europe as a whole , it would mean make nonsense of the European institution ' solemn proclamation on the fundamental value which unite us and which we demand , rightly so , of applicant for membership . </s>
this be why we support the spirit of the statement make by the presidency and the @card@ Member States , as well as that of the President of the European Parliament , insofar as , unlike the lacklustre and ambiguous statement make by the Commission , it aim to make people get the measure of the danger and to provoke a response . </s>
of course , there can be no question of cast opprobrium upon the people of Austria . </s>
any action which can be take must , in our opinion , serve the twofold function of proscribe Haider without , however , isolate Austrian society . </s>
democrat in this country now need our support more than ever . </s>
the great join of force in protest in Vienna on @card@ November last year must now undergo development suit to the new situation . </s>
we must have dialogue with them and join force with them , stand at their side in order to offer the people of Austria some alternative prospect . </s>
finally , we must ask ourselves : how do we come to be in this position ? </s>
certainly , in the first instance , as far as Austrian political leader be concern , it be a matter of answer this existential question for the future of democracy , start with those who have just take the inordinate risk of give the extreme right a boost . </s>
but , beyond that , no one , include the European Union , can , in our opinion , be exempt from ask themselves what ground there be for permit an unscrupulous demagogue to exploit the frustration and fear generate by policy in which too many sector of the population be disregard . </s>
this debate be now before us , but each and every one of us , male and female , be go to assume their responsibility without delay . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , we could have be debate the need to reinforce the founding principle of the Union , so that we can uphold them together . </s>
instead , we have be force to debate the formal , substantial error that have be make in the last few day . </s>
we be astonish by the political naivety of people who , with thoughtless word , have bolster Mr Haider 's position in Austria and make the Union look ridiculous , ride roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announce unconstitutional measure . </s>
we have never before see such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affair of a Member State . </s>
of course , we can violate the founding value of Europe , and in this regard , the Italian Prime Minister state that these principle be include in a treaty : he mention the Treaty of Copenhagen , which I , like you , have never hear of because it do not exist . </s>
maybe he be refer to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which list certain principle and Article 7 certain procedure , in order to establish that a Member State be seriously and continuously violate the principle refer to in Article 6 . </s>
however , up till now , Austria have commit no serious or persistent violation . </s>
apart from amount to interference , the statement by the Presidency be discriminatory because it authorise the penalisation of a population and deny these people their right to choose who to vote for . </s>
no political cohesion have so far come about , not even in the fight against organise crime , or in defence of the victim of genocide ; we do not have a currency that be even remotely stable or an economy which really do combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only take one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union 's credibility . </s>
sanction can be impose after the treaty have be violate , but can be apply if a democratically elect party enter government . </s>
otherwise , how will we deal with communist country which return to communism : will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government , or will Stalin 's grandchild be forgive for everything ? </s>
( applause from the right ) it be via diplomacy , persuasion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threat or via anti-constitutional mean that the institution can ensure respect for themselves and for principle . </s>
bilateral relation involve the States , so the @card@ do not come into this . </s>
this be ride roughshod over the European institution in order to defend political way of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of party which have just emerge from totalitarian regime . </s>
it be not what you would expect of the representative of democratic tradition . </s>
so many thing set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often write - include his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region . </s>
however , we already know this . </s>
however , today we be concern to learn that other representative of the Union seem to have turn their back on the Union 's democratic role . </s>
we support legality and democracy as express by the people , and favour uphold national sovereignty as long as this do not violate the principle of the Treaty or human right . </s>
we believe in Europe , while it seem that other have start the process of break up the Union . </s>
this be what have come of rush headlong into enlargement and not clearly define role and task . </s>
we have build a Europe with an unstable market , not a Europe with principle , right and politics . </s>
and these be the consequence ! </s>
therefore , we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who be work to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people , thereby ensure that this people retain its freedom and maintain good relation with other people . </s>
madam President , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy . </s>
here we have a council which have manage to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a state in the event of a serious and persistent breach . </s>
in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria . </s>
There be risk , as we be all aware , but in the event there be absolutely no serious and persistent breach . </s>
if we be to apply the criterion of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criterion to the European Union , then , most certainly , this European Union could not become a member , although the country of Eastern Europe be require to meet them . </s>
and if we be to speak of serious and persistent breach , then perhaps we could mention some Member States , such as Italy and France , first and third , respectively , in the list of country condemn by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court . </s>
we could mention , my Belgian friend , Belgium and the Dutroux case , the dozen upon dozen of child kidnap , torture , rape and murder by lead personality in this country , where inquiry be bogged down , make no headway . </s>
we could , if one third of the member of Parliament so request , require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter . </s>
we could ask ourselves why the Austrian be reject @card@ year , @card@ year of party politics which have make one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten , just as it be now corrupt country such as Italy , Belgium and other European Union Member States . </s>
we might well wonder why @card@ % of Belgian citizen have no faith in the justice system in their country or why @card@ % of French citizen have no confidence in their country 's system of justice , and @card@ % of Italian citizen have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , be very concern by this debate . </s>
we can , and we do not , support in any way the sentiment and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his reference to the Third Reich . </s>
we also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfere in the policy of an elect government of any country , especially one which be part of the European Union . </s>
my party at home be certainly not racist , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well . </s>
be you go to interfere with Great Britain 's Parliament if we be elect ? </s>
Madame President , the people of Austria have speak by elect Herr Haider to their Parliament . </s>
I believe they give him @card@ % of the vote so there be go to be a coalition government . </s>
your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider have an effect on the policy of that country . </s>
then , and only then , might you consider if human right be affect . </s>
your Parliament may consider measure appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfere in the constitutional affair of a country of the European Union . </s>
madam President , as a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concern some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic development in Austria . </s>
my reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally be at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity display towards Austria in matter of respect for human right , have a sense of responsibility for one 's own past , and the stability of democracy . </s>
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulder for the often dubious image other country tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly . </s>
the refusal of our government , down through the year , to acknowledge our complicity in the horror of the Second World War , together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victim and those force into hard labour , have do a great deal to bolster this negative image . </s>
this FPÖ have now enter into a coalition with the ÖVP , due to the outcome of election hold on 3 October @card@ , when the previous government be vote out of office . </s>
this be the citizen of a state 's prerogative , for it be the founding principle of a democracy . </s>
when the talk between the SPÖ and ÖVP break down , the Socialists attempt to form a minority government and ask the FPÖ for their support . </s>
we be offer three ministerial post - you can read it for yourself in the newspaper - the very party that be be denounce as fascistic here ! </s>
when we suddenly refuse this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign begin that be beyond our comprehension to this day . </s>
the FPÖ party be establish in Austria 's political landscape . </s>
the head of the government of one of the nine province belong to this party and it be involve in all the other provincial government . </s>
What many Austrian be wonder today be why their democratic decision have suddenly be interpret as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign do not begin until the Freedom Party reject the support of a minority government comprise the SPÖ ? </s>
There be prejudice at work here , which - without go into our programme - be reduce the dark hour of European history to a political spectacle . </s>
I be fill with disgust when certain of our opponent get mileage out of the million of death that take place in the gas chamber of the concentration camp as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the Italian MEP Bertinotti do yesterday on Italian TV when he accuse Mr Haider of deny the holocaust . </s>
shame on you Mr Bertinotti ! </s>
you might have run out of political argument but that do not give you the right to use those who be murder as cheap propaganda . </s>
denounce a democratically elect politician as a Nazi do not make you an anti-fascist ! </s>
on the contrary , you be deride the true victim of National socialism and play down what the fascist dictator do . </s>
your behaviour stem from your own prejudice , you be dispense with any form of political debate and you be display precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose . </s>
the attack against Austria 's new government and the attempt to exert political influence in a Member State be an insult to the Austrian people . </s>
that be why we be indebted to the Commission for take a stance that separate it from the rest . </s>
the new coalition agreement be about reform a democracy , the right of the opposition , commitment to compensate those force into hard labour ... . </s>
( the President cut the speaker off ) Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abundantly clear : Austria be not in danger of experience a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion . </s>
Austria be a stable democracy ; one in which human right and fundamental freedom be guarantee under the constitution and be afford the protection of an independent judiciary . </s>
Austria be a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there . </s>
There be nothing unusual about what be happen in Austria : there have be a changeover of power follow democratic election , in consequence of which an old system be vote out and a stable parliamentary majority prepare to carry out the necessary economic and social reform be seek and find . </s>
There will be a function majority and likewise a function opposition . </s>
the Austrian People 's Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , use to be and still be a party that have consistently speak up for the integration of my country into the Eu and feel deeply attach to the community of value that be the European Union , and likewise its basic political principle of deepen and enlargement . </s>
we respect and accept the discussion that be take place and also appreciate the concern that be be voice in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria . </s>
our understanding spring from the knowledge that our history of the recent past have bequeath to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present . </s>
our country be not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people be perpetrator too , although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt . </s>
the ÖVP play no small part in help Austria find its way into the European Union . </s>
my country 's place be not outside the European Union but in it ... ... , with all the right and commitment that this entail ! </s>
any future government must therefore be judge accord to the value and principle it profess to in its manifesto , and not accord to the prejudgement put about both by political adversary and the international medium . </s>
a declare belief in human right , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest reappraisal of Austria 's role in the past , in pass on information on the grave crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflect in the fundamental accord underlie a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ . </s>
my party can be rely upon to see to it that my country hold firm to the course of European politics and continue to be root in the European community of value ! </s>
( applause ) Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it be a black day for Austria and for Europe . </s>
not even Mr Sichrovsky 's web of lie or Mrs Stenzel 's word of appeasement can do anything to change that . </s>
for the day have dawn : two irresponsible politician , consume with a lust for power , be sell Austria 's image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interest , down the river ! </s>
( applause , heckle ) they be trade this in for a head of government 's position and for membership of a government . </s>
they be just as prepare to take on board the fact that Austria will go from be a revere country to a revile one , as they be its threaten isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizen . </s>
I believe - as do many who for year have campaign against Haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleague in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measure announce by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representative , be grave and also inappropriate . </s>
however , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , be direct exclusively against those who have provoke these reaction and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their party , ... ... and that include their representative in this Parliament . </s>
Mr Poettering , it be interesting to note that you be in almost as difficult a position as I be , albeit for different reason , for you be have to defend something that go against your conviction . </s>
you be have to defend a certain Mr Schüssel , you be have to consort with Schüssel as he be today and who , as I understand it , be recently tell not to come to the representative of the Christian Democratic party 's summit meeting . </s>
the argument that Mr Poettering himself use have come into play , i. e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he be to be integrate into the political system . </s>
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrate into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement . </s>
Anyone who feed on prejudice towards foreigner and ethnic minority and give succour to these prejudice , whose programme feature parochialism and anti-liberalism , who display loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relation , and who have never yet distance themselves clearly and unequivocally from National socialism , have neither the intention nor inclination to integrate ! </s>
( applause ) this historic weight of guilt fall on the shoulder of the conservative for have consort with the wolf of their own free will and wait to be devour . </s>
that be how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - be sustain rather than keep in check . </s>
I understand that Europe and the civilised world want to have as little as possible to do with such a government . </s>
however , by the same token , there be another Austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrate against the FPÖ have any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government . </s>
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria ! </s>
( applause ) the more powerful this Europe become and the more vigilant it be towards authoritarian tendency in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in strike at the root of right-wing extremism . </s>
for Europe be and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism . </s>
Please support the Austrian people against this government ! </s>
( applause ) Madam President , this be an historic moment , as it be now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union have gradually develop into a community of value . </s>
we see this , now that the government of one Member State be be join by a party which , as be know , do not respect all these value . </s>
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen state emanate from the Council be justify , as in a way this be also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union , mean this be also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria 's . </s>
as member of Parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begin to establish fundamental right be more important than ever . </s>
it be more important than ever that respect for , and non-violation of , human value and the right of minority , include the right of all those who live within the territory of the European Union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the Eu , and , for this reason , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be make legally binding . </s>
it must not be allow to remain a mere declaration . </s>
as important be the fact that Austria 's force of democracy should be give support , as none of us wish to isolate the country . </s>
we know that most Austrian respect these value . </s>
they have also show how they feel : not all the demonstration have take place outside Austria . </s>
doubtless there be also a lot of protest voter on the scene that have want a change in Austrian policy for a long time . </s>
I believe Parliament should support these force of democracy . </s>
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibility for form a government make up of democratic force . </s>
madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Francis Wurtz , remind us of just now . </s>
I welcome the statement by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the @card@ country which have reject official contact with an Austrian government that include Jörg Haider 's party . </s>
the fact that we be stress this be all the more important because , as you know , we essentially disagree with the policy make by Europe , with its economic and social policy , its democratic deficit and the Member States ' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans . </s>
our normal disagreement further emphasise our appreciation today : this be extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo-nazi element in Europe be extraordinary . </s>
this danger do not concern Austria , it concern Europe . </s>
we be talk about us , not Austria . </s>
we know the social cause which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to fuel tendency towards this ; we know the accompanying cultural cause - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing group to settle account with Nazism , we can fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture be create in Europe . </s>
not only the Alpine region , but all our country be involve : the condition be be create whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat . </s>
the position take by the presidency have show that it be aware of this tragedy for civilisation . </s>
Europe be show that it have not forget Auschwitz ; Europe be come face to face with the suffering of the past . </s>
now , though , it should follow through with its action , and the first to follow through should be the Commission , which , however , have be obscure and weak on this , make the value of the presidency 's position even more apparent . </s>
this be the change we must impose on the Commission 's action . </s>
madam President , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human right and the freedom and sovereignty of people , which oppose fascism , Nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speaker talk about the sovereignty of the Austrian people , we be today witness this sovereignty be deny by Parliament . </s>
in the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party , there be nothing to justify the accusation that it be attack the principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right , fundamental freedom or the rule of law , enshrine in Article 6 of the treaty . </s>
I would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office , who have be so critical of Austria , have recently consign the inhabitant of Macao to the sovereign rule of the people 's Democratic Republic of China . </s>
perhaps , in order to strengthen the Union 's democracy , it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that be democratically elect by the Austrian citizen , while bring Turkey and its &quot; Grey Wolves &quot; into Europe . </s>
madam President , we be debate an extremely serious issue . </s>
we be debate nothing less than the presence in a Member State 's government of a political force whose doctrine and principle be incompatible with the conceptual and moral base of the Union enshrine in its founding treaty . </s>
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party 's manifesto be enough to make any democratic conscience shudder . </s>
the view that ethnicity be the define factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group have superiority over other , as be write here , revive old ghost of the century which we have just leave behind , which some historian have describe as the century of horror ; horror which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider 's manifesto have stir up once again , to our amazement . </s>
of course Austria be a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affair of a Member State . </s>
however , that be not the problem . </s>
the question be whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which include such a party . </s>
our answer to this crucial question be no . </s>
leave aside strategic and tactical consideration , leave aside possible exoneration base on other people 's behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interest , the Spanish delegation of the People 's Group of this Parliament , in full agreement with the Spanish People 's Party and the Spanish government , clearly express its full agreement with the statement of @card@ January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council . </s>
we agree with its substance , its tone and its scope . </s>
( applause ) Konrad Adenauer once say - and he know what he be say - that the sure way to pacify a tiger be to allow it to devour you . </s>
history be a compendium of event which could have be avoid . </s>
therefore , Madam President , the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message , reject of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdication , renunciation and opportunism which mark Europe 's past and for which we have pay such a heavy price . </s>
( loud applause ) Madam President , the European Union be build upon the idea ' never again ' , mean never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camp , anti-Semitism , heightened nationalism or war . </s>
the one and only significance of the European Union be the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which give the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe , and which be still highly topical today . </s>
it be not true to say that , when a government form an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe , this be merely a question of national sovereignty . </s>
for this Union of ours be not a grouping of neighbour nation state who be simply come to mutual arrangement to improve their collective circumstance . </s>
it be a community that be destine to exist , in which , when the main thing be under threat , when value be under threat , all democrat must bend over backwards to find solution to ensure that the mistake of the past be never make again . </s>
let us learn the lesson of the past . </s>
in the thirty , when Adolf Hitler be democratically elect , although with a minority , many people think that it be not as bad as all that and , Mr Poettering , in France , a number of man and woman , on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasion too , think , ' Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire . </s>
' they put their own petty squabble first , and the rest be history . </s>
we must make a rapid , strong and unite response . </s>
I would have like to hear your discussion with the Austrian President , Mr Poettering . </s>
we be well aware that he be very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government have do in form such an alliance . </s>
so our response must be rapid and strong . </s>
of course , the Treaty provide us with a barrier when thing become intolerable ; I be almost go to say ' irreparable ' . </s>
history have teach us that fascist start to blow hot and cold : use heated word first , in populist , xenophobic speech , and then cool word in order to make themselves acceptable to institution and to infiltrate them gradually , poisoning them , until the day they start to take action . </s>
and when that day come , it be too late . </s>
so our Treaty have make provision for barrier for the time when it be too late , but we be not at that point : today we have to take step to ensure that we do not get to that point . </s>
we must therefore find a political solution . </s>
I support the Council proposal in this , while deplore a certain lack of strength , a certain spinelessness , on the part of the Commission which will , however , have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis , with determination over time , since fascist count on the spinelessness of democracy , they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their view in the end . </s>
our response must be rapid . </s>
if today we do not staunchly support the Council , then history will judge us , say that we achieve the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement . </s>
madam President , I be please about the fact that , in Austria , the will of the large majority of the people be be respect and that this formation of government constitute , in my eye , a huge victory for democracy . </s>
let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thank a Europe which develop into a kind of &quot; big brother &quot; and which keep watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and use Stalinist method . </s>
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lesson from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian government that embrace corrupt party finance by arm dealer and that appoint the leader of such a corrupt party , which be condemn by the court , to the post of European Commissioner . </s>
today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which be important to all nation within Europe and to anyone who feel particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech . </s>
madam President , this debate be open by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirm that the Eu presidency be try to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States . </s>
this debate , and the background to it , reinforce the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself be dominate by Socialists . </s>
my delegation of @card@ Conservative and Unionist member from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlie philosophy , programme and tone of Austria 's Freedom Party . </s>
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policy on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself . </s>
we be also outrage , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excess of the former USSR . </s>
even today , surely it be high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal link with China 's Communist Party . </s>
not a word be say by these same Eu government about coalition government involve fellow-travelling communist in French or Italian government , or in German state government , or even the British government 's willingness to promote those with terrorist association as minister in Northern Ireland today . </s>
this , Madam President , be the hypocrisy of the left . </s>
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standard , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist head of Eu government and include that of the United States . </s>
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produce uncomfortable result . </s>
this require action to address the underlie cause , include an examination of the electoral process itself . </s>
that should be our task , not political posturing . </s>
madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holocaust Conference end in Stockholm . </s>
its aim be to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today 's society which take the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism . </s>
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institution of the Eu , a xenophobic party which flirt with Nazi idea . </s>
secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluation . </s>
we demand of the candidate state and of the country with which the Eu cooperate under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human right and show tolerance towards their neighbour . </s>
we must do the same as far as we ourselves be concern . </s>
that be why we be react against this carry-on in Austria . </s>
it be not acceptable to continue as if nothing have happen . </s>
we be at a watershed in the history of the European Union . </s>
the Union be not only an economic community but also a community of value , something which we take seriously . </s>
something have happen . </s>
the European Union be in the process of find its soul and get some steel in its spine . </s>
madam President , as everyone have say , this be a very important day . </s>
it be the day of the first debate of European political life . </s>
and this be not pure chance . </s>
I feel that today 's meeting be not a meeting of Europe , our institution , with Austria or Mr Haider 's party . </s>
it be the meeting of Europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reason why we be here in this Chamber . </s>
this Chamber be not make for good , it be not make for money . </s>
this Chamber , and the European institution , be build to uphold value , morality and a certain spirit . </s>
in the twentieth century , we have have experience of the fact that democracy can find themselves at risk , and morality , value and the spirit which I mention can be mortally affect by virus which have just one name : nationalist glorification , populism and the concept of racial superiority . </s>
the fact be that it be enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider 's party , the FPÖ , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter . </s>
read only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vidal-Quadras , have previously mention , &quot; the nation be define by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . </s>
&quot; well , we can accept such statement . </s>
if Europe have any meaning , and - my friend will pardon me tell them - if Christian democracy have any meaning , if the history of Christian democracy have any meaning , then it must declare itself radically oppose to the statement make in this manifesto and , whatever excellent reason be give whenever history serve the same dish up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation . </s>
this be the reason why I feel that the European Parliament , which have more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission , must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institution who have the courage to say no , and it must say , Madam President , that you make a statement on our behalf which do us credit , and in clear term declare , without prevarication , its opposition to and condemnation of imminent event in Austria , recall the statement make on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who say that , if you be go to have to say no , then the good time to do so be right at the beginning . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , we the Belgian Christian democrat be concern as , fortunately , be a great many other member too . </s>
the coalition which be be create in one of the Member States be clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly have a European dimension too . </s>
because what be it that unite us in Europe ? </s>
surely it be the value and principle of freedom , democracy and respect for human right , more than anything . </s>
the Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Haider , have repeatedly repudiate these value . </s>
he also repudiate the basic form of diplomatic politeness . </s>
he be a dangerous man . </s>
the Christian Democratic party in my country have make up their mind a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protest of extreme-right voter but never to negotiate with extreme-right leader . </s>
value should take precedence over power . </s>
we deplore , therefore , what be happen in Austria . </s>
in fact , we be shake by it . </s>
we be extremely disappoint . </s>
as a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternative . </s>
we keep remind them about Article 6 of the Treaty . </s>
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right . </s>
if , despite this , the coalition go ahead , we would urge the ÖVP party member to ensure that the principle and value which underlie European integration be observe in political programme , both in word and deed . </s>
madam President , Austria await a heavy responsibility . </s>
madam President , it be clear that we in this Parliament be very largely agree on reject Mr Haider and his politics , but it be equally clear that opinion differ as to the most effective way of oppose this brand of politics . </s>
have you stop to ask what kind of effect the debate we be have here and the statement deliver by the Council Presidency last weekend be have in Austria itself ? </s>
have you stop to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfold from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ? </s>
have you stop to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP be to be fulfill and election be to be hold in Austria in the course of the next few day ? </s>
from all account , this would only serve to strengthen Haider . </s>
who would want this to happen ? </s>
be it not our responsibility to give think to how we should tackle this brand of politics ? </s>
Europe be a community of law . </s>
Democracy , respect for human right and rule of law be amongst the principle that we must uphold . </s>
One of the precept of democracy be that we should not disapprove of electoral outcome but respect them , and that be why we must respect the fact that the Austrian , by virtue of their political culture , vote as they do . </s>
it be for reason of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have make the statement he do , and in a manner that go against the Treaty . </s>
it would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic , constitutional and well-known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that be why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take ! </s>
( applause ) Madam President , they say , where I come from , ' it be three time for a Welshman ' , and three time , as I think you will discover in the course of that debate , I signify my desire to respond very briefly to what have be an excellent , and on several occasion , a move debate . </s>
first of all , could I express my thank on behalf of President Prodi and my colleague in the Commission for the support and understanding offer by several member of the House to the position take by the Commission in the statement that we make yesterday . </s>
I must respond also to the fact , of course , that there be reference during the debate - and I use some of the word employ - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the Commission 's opinion . </s>
I be duty- bind to say to this house , there be no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offer , or indeed the action take , by the Commission on this issue . </s>
we make explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as do the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrate by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday . </s>
secondly , we say , in very specific term , that we will work closely with all Member States in examine the situation as it develop in Austria . </s>
thirdly , we express , in very explicit term , that we will uphold without fear or favour the value and the provision of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensure that those value of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedom be uphold . </s>
There be no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all . </s>
and , when I say that the Commission take that view , I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler , who be from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstrate his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission , under oath , in be part of that statement that we make yesterday morning . </s>
Anyone , therefore , who invite Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality be Austrian , should examine their own motive in the context of a debate , which have be necessarily shadow by reference to xenophobia and even more lethal evil in this world . </s>
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler . </s>
Could I also say , Madam President , that the understanding of the presidency , the Portuguese presidency , for our position , be absolutely demonstrate in the clear term by Mr Da Costa when he say , and I quote him , that ' Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine be not affect by the current situation ' . </s>
that surely be in everyone 's interest . </s>
in order to ensure that the Treaty be uphold and that we sustain what be describe as the Community machine , we be follow the course of action which be set down in our statement yesterday . </s>
we will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour . </s>
that be our duty . </s>
it be also a matter of conviction . </s>
my final point be this . </s>
we understand the context of this essential debate . </s>
There be several people here who like myself for many year past have become familiar with Herr Haider 's offensive statement , the xenophobia of many of his policy element and the strategy that he have develop of alternate aggressive statement with apology , sometimes on successive day . </s>
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he have of Nazism . </s>
and , when we recall that , like many other on all side of this House , my and my colleague ' instinct be naturally arouse . </s>
however , the Commission have to act on the basis of value and law and not only on the basis of instinct . </s>
and that be why we come to the conclusion we reach yesterday morning . </s>
that be why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the value and the law . </s>
without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people . </s>
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox say in the debate , ' necessarily with acute vigilance ' . </s>
I wonder , since Mr Da Costa have be listen to these remark from the back of the Chamber , whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission support the view explicitly state by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the head of government . </s>
do the Commission support the Council ? </s>
madam President , when the Commission say yesterday morning that it note the view express as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and share the concern that give rise to that view , I think it can be take for grant that since yesterday morning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it have have a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States . </s>
thank you , Commissioner Kinnock . </s>
I think that we have just have a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expect of it . </s>
thank you , lady and gentleman . </s>
the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ a. m. tomorrow . </s>
recourse to the precautionary principle the next item be the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle . </s>
I want to start by say that I be please to be present this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it have be write together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen . </s>
the precautionary principle be not a new concept . </s>
it have be use by the Community for some time now in a range of policy area , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it be explicitly mention in the environmental provision of the EC Treaty since Maastricht . </s>
it also appear in a range of international text , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol . </s>
the essence of the precautionary principle be clear . </s>
it involve take action in a give policy area when the science be not clear , but where there be reasonable ground for concern that the potential risk be big enough to require action . </s>
however , the use of the precautionary principle have be increasingly in the spotlight in recent year . </s>
event such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulate a grow public debate about the circumstance in which precautionary action be justified and necessary . </s>
in view of this grow interest , the Commission therefore consider that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle . </s>
the basic aim of the communication be twofold . </s>
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission apply , and intend to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guideline for its application base on reason and coherent principle . </s>
we also hope that the communication will help to build a well common understanding of how to manage risk and to dispel fear that the precautionary principle might be use in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism . </s>
the Commission 's start point in apply the precautionary principle be the need to ensure a high level of protection in the field of environmental , human , animal and plant health . </s>
of course , this objective can be use to justify irrational or arbitrary measure , but it do mean that action can still be take even in situation where the science be unclear . </s>
as such , while the precautionary principle do not involve the politicisation of science , as some have allege , it do take us to the crossroad between science and politics . </s>
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depend largely on the level of protection seek and the level of risk that decision-maker be prepare to accept for society . </s>
it be therefore political by nature . </s>
however , the measure that may subsequently be take must obviously comply with the general principle applicable to risk management and the guideline for apply the precautionary principle be therefore the key element of the paper . </s>
measure take must be proportional to the choose level of protection - that be , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut . </s>
they must be non-discriminatory in their application , that be measure should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin . </s>
and they must be consistent with similar measure already take . </s>
for example , if one product have be approve , similar product should also be approve . </s>
measure be base on an examination of the potential benefit and cost of action or lack of action ; that be , the measure should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific datum and be clear about who be responsible for produce the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that be the burden of proof . </s>
All these element have to apply cumulatively . </s>
it be also important to bear in mind that there be a wide range of measure , which can be take in apply the precautionary principle . </s>
for example , a research programme , public information campaign , recommendation and so on . </s>
apply the precautionary principle do not , therefore , automatically imply a ban . </s>
this communication do not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it be the first time that the Commission have present a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use . </s>
by set out in some detail how the Commission apply , and intend to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement . </s>
I have three short question , the first be as follow . </s>
we have be await a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it be anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speak with one voice . </s>
do the document you have present here today also accord with the opinion of your colleague the commissioner for Industry , Foreign Trade , competition and the Internal Market ? </s>
I be sure that your answer to this will be &quot; yes &quot; but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentleman be also aware as to what the consequence of this will be ? </s>
my next question , Mrs Wallström , be when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertain to chemical or other sector , for example ? </s>
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle have be apply in legislation ? </s>
in other word , will each proposal contain an additional sheet state that check have be make as to the application of the precautionary principle and the follow conclusion have be reach ? </s>
. </s>
thank you very much , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , for these question . </s>
of course , this be share by the whole Commission . </s>
this be a common communication which be write by the three of us , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it have be pass unanimously in the Commission today . </s>
it receive strong support from the rest of the commissioner and it have be through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission . </s>
so we have really work through this document and I be sure that they be all able to describe the guideline and the principle as lay down in this document . </s>
yes , I would say we already use this way of work with different , difficult issue like a new chemical strategy for example . </s>
and , I be sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle . </s>
we have just recently have a case of use the precautionary principle when it come to ban phthalates in soft PVC toy ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental area . </s>
it have be mainly use in the environmental field , but , of course also when it come to human health . </s>
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , regard the relationship between science , on the one hand , and apply the precautionary principle on the other , the communication state that invoke that precautionary principle always require a political decision if there be a lack of scientific evidence . </s>
needless to say , this accord science a great deal of power . </s>
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientist will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ? </s>
the communication also state that the precautionary principle can be apply , provide there be a sufficient recognise minority of scientist . </s>
I would like to ask , what be , then , the definition of a recognise minority ? </s>
How would you describe this ? </s>
What establish a recognise minority ? </s>
if a political decision be involve , I would also like to ask : who take this political decision ? </s>
the Commission ? </s>
the Council ? </s>
and to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ? </s>
What be the role of the scientific committee ? </s>
What , also , will be the role of the food authority which you be about to set up ? </s>
finally , will this whole decision-making process be carry out in a transparent , public way ? </s>
these be my three question . </s>
. </s>
yes , Mr President , that be true . </s>
There be many and difficult issue and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some question . </s>
who will take the decision , who be the decision-maker ? </s>
well , that depend on who the legislator be . </s>
this be part of risk management . </s>
they have to look at , for example , the concern of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what be know about the scientific evidence in a certain case . </s>
however , it be true that it do not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle . </s>
it can be use on evidence from a minority or where science be incomplete . </s>
that be , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science . </s>
it be not always easy to describe exactly how this process be do , but there be no question of change the scientific base . </s>
we use the expert to get as much scientific information and fact as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be do in the future . </s>
you have to see this as a tool for risk management . </s>
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that be available . </s>
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science . </s>
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not . </s>
so , there be no answer to all your question but this do not change the system of the scientist that we use today or the system of expert that we use today . </s>
Mr President , I have a question concern an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle . </s>
it be about brominate flame retardant . </s>
it be a fact that these substance be now be discover . </s>
There be increase concentration of them in both people and the environment . </s>
There be many people who maintain that they entail major risk , while other question how large the risk involve in these substance really be . </s>
recently , both Sweden and Denmark urge the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominate flame retardant . </s>
I be wonder , therefore , if you be prepare such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjöstedt , for this question . </s>
the issue of brominate flame retardant be an important one . </s>
it be raise quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of minister who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be do . </s>
we be in the process of look into this question and assess what knowledge we have today and what it be possible to do . </s>
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle do not need to be synonymous with there be a total ban . </s>
There may be a series of different measure which can be take . </s>
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpret as a ban . </s>
where brominate flame retardant be concern , there may eventually be a ban , but it be important to say that the precautionary principle permit the whole spectrum of political measure and initiative to be take . </s>
this issue be extremely topical . </s>
the Commission be to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what need to be do . </s>
you say that the precautionary principle should not be use as a disguised trade barrier . </s>
be the understanding of this point the same on both side of the Atlantic Ocean ? </s>
I think we be go to have problem particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modify crop . </s>
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ? </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , I be please to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just sign a protocol concern bio-safety . </s>
we succeed there in agree , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle . </s>
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeed in conclude this protocol . </s>
I believe it will set the trend for future discussion concern the precautionary principle . </s>
we be go to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle be to be interpret . </s>
it be , moreover , also accept as an important and effective tool . </s>
Mr President , I have two question . </s>
I shall try to be very brief indeed . </s>
the first question concern the implementation of the precautionary principle . </s>
as I have understand it , there have be a certain lack of clarity in some respect as to how this be to be understand . </s>
be it the case that a risk assessment be firstly to be carry out , include a cost-benefit analysis ? </s>
in that case , I be rather concern , because the idea be really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be use as a tool for decide whether the precautionary principle should be introduce . </s>
instead , the precautionary principle should come first . </s>
my second question concern the burden of proof . </s>
I remember Margot Wallström be introduce as Commissioner in the Committee . </s>
at that time , she be talk about the desire for a reversed burden of proof . </s>
in other word , a product 's manufacturer be to demonstrate whether or not the product be hazardous . </s>
I want to know whether this also apply in the document which the Commission have present now . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) thank you , Mrs Schörling . </s>
these be two important question , and it be good that I should be give the opportunity to clarify them . </s>
no , one must not begin by carry out a cost-benefit analysis . </s>
instead , the latter should be base upon an assessment of what it be we know , of what science have to tell us and of how we should view the product concern in the light of the risk we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human being or animal . </s>
when , on the other hand , the decision have be make to take a certain measure , the one choose ought to be cost-effective so that there be in fact no resort to measure which be wholly unreasonable give their degree of effectiveness . </s>
it be not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis . </s>
the second question concern the reversed burden of proof . </s>
it be perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain case . </s>
I have use chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this . </s>
there , however , we be concern with that particular area , whereas it may be say that the present communication concern the precautionary principle be horizontal in the sense that it concern the full range of specific technical area that be of political concern . </s>
therefore , the issue of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof be to look like be not especially discuss in this context . </s>
instead , it be a question of political decision-making and of the base for this . </s>
it be , however , perfectly correct that , when it come , for example , to chemical , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof . </s>
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle need to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confuse by all the different interpretation possible . </s>
I will give an example : a fungicide have be prove to cause baby to be bear blind . </s>
it be therefore a teratogenic substance . </s>
very well , it be a fungicide , it kill off mould . </s>
this teratogenicity have be demonstrate by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it be the only one that have carry out test . </s>
now , in my opinion , give that this be such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lay down that this product should immediately be take off the market , which New Zealand have do , for example . </s>
so I want to put this question to you . </s>
when human health be at stake , or there be the possibility that human health will be seriously affect , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ? </s>
the cost of a baby be bear blind be too high ; there be no benefit that can compensate for this . </s>
in short , Commissioner , I would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be take off the market , until such time as another laboratory provide evidence to the contrary . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , no one want more than I do to see a situation in which we be able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it be see as radically protect people 's health and the environment . </s>
obviously , I can adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which have be mention here , but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case . </s>
the truth , of course , be that a great many Member States , and no doubt other nation too , have take measure to protect their population ' health which amount to use the precautionary principle , even if it have not always be call that . </s>
naturally , it be not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure be avoid . </s>
nor must it be a case of sit and calculate the value of a human life over and against the cost of take a particular measure . </s>
I think , however , it be quite obvious that when it be eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be take , it be often the case that there be many different course of action to choose between . </s>
in those circumstance , consideration should be give to what be likely to produce the good result . </s>
I can forbear tell you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective be use by people whom one can perhaps imagine use it , namely when I be on a visit to Africa . </s>
at a hospice for AIDS patient , I meet two Irish Catholic nun who be care for die AIDS patient . </s>
they be the first to say that , each day , they must think about do what be most cost-effective because resource have to suffice for their poor patient there . </s>
we must be very careful about how we use resource . </s>
I believe we can learn something from this . </s>
we must , of course , always ensure that we use our resource in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broad possible help . </s>
as be also explain in the present communication , it be not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis . </s>
consideration should be give to what science be offer in the way of knowledge , and this should be use as an important political tool for protect the environment and people 's health . </s>
Mr President , it be a rare honour to be give a second opportunity to ask question ! </s>
commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I ask about the other commissioner , for it may have sound as though I be in jest . </s>
indeed you respond in kind , as I know you would do . </s>
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill ask , that be to the connection we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union . </s>
I have good reason for ask this . </s>
as you rightly say , the precautionary principle be need in precisely those area where , as yet , there be no scientific evidence . </s>
How can we ensure that we will not be lay ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partner in the USA , on account of the bio safety protocol not be adequate to their purpose ? </s>
How can we be sure that those of your colleague responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they do on the last few occasion with your predecessor , keep pull the carpet from underneath you ? </s>
that be exactly what it be all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talk about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner ! </s>
Mr President , I think it be extremely important to point to the present communication 's guideline for use the precautionary principle as a way of repudiate assertion to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reason . </s>
I be certain that we be go to have more conflict , for example with the United States . </s>
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise . </s>
ever since we sign this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition write into a protocol deal with the environment , health and trade . </s>
this constitute a good example , therefore . </s>
we should be in no doubt that conflict may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily . </s>
we now have a number of guideline for use the precautionary principle , and we have increase support among our respective people for use it , something which be clearly establish in the present communication . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the focus on the political precautionary principle mean that we have being discuss it for almost two hour and this topic be now be view , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have be able to establish from the intervention , question and reply , it be a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
Intergovernmental Conference the next item be the report ( A5-0018 / @card@ ) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the convene of the Intergovernmental Conference [ @card@ / @card@ - C5-0341 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ] . </s>
Mr President , I will begin by thank the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contact . </s>
let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration . </s>
the Intergovernmental conference that be about to begin be important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement . </s>
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method base on which Europe will be function in the twentieth century . </s>
for the European union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need be an extensive and in-depth reform of the institution and the way they work . </s>
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieve that reform be the agenda base on which the Intergovernmental Conference be to begin its work . </s>
from the decision make at the Helsinki Summit , it emerge that the agenda agree there be unsatisfactory and do not guarantee the essential and substantive change require for create a more functional Europe , one that be more effective , more democratic and more transparent . </s>
this be because the Helsinki agenda be limit to consideration only of the three issue that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union 's institutional body . </s>
I will not repeat which one , because everyone know . </s>
my conclusion be justify on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demand of the people of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union be already involve , namely enlargement . </s>
grant this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issue which , properly address , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union 's institution . </s>
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issue which , for that very reason , be highly visible to the European public . </s>
in its numerous debate and its report so far the European Parliament have openly support the convene of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
at the same time , however , I be ask for it to include issue that improve and complement the reform , I repeat , of all the institutional body as well as issue that be of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism . </s>
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widen be still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency , which have repeatedly make a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary effort towards that end . </s>
All the same , whether or not more issue will be consider must in no way diminish the importance attribute by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
this be because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future be a foundation of European integration and be therefore a matter of the great national importance for every one of the Union 's Member States . </s>
in light of what I have say , I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you , so that on @card@ February , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representative , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos , can proceed with the difficult task that await them with the European Parliament 's backing . </s>
the same apply to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposal he put before us . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , in common with my co-rapporteur , Mr Dimitrakopoulos , I take the view that the agenda agree on in Helsinki be not up to meet the challenge that enlargement of the Eu by @card@ new state will bring . </s>
as far as we be concerned , mini reform would represent a lose opportunity . </s>
mini reform would also jeopardise the stability of the European Union . </s>
the European Parliament could not , indeed must not , allow the European union to be jeopardise in this way , that be by overstretching it and fall short when it come to deepen . </s>
we would like to take this opportunity to remind the government once again that Parliament must give its consent before a new Member can accede to the Union . </s>
Parliament be also sure to form the decision it have to make on enlargement in the light of the outcome of this Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
on @card@ November @card@ , we name the key point on our agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference @card@ . </s>
I would just like to reiterate a few point : provision for reinforce cooperation with these @card@ and @card@ Member States , integrate security and defence policy into the Community framework , incorporate the Charter of Citizens ' right into the new Treaty , constitutionalising the Union by divide it into a main part and a subsidiary part , reform Article @card@ so that when it come to future treaty amendment , Parliament will play a real part in the negotiation on an equal footing , and - another thing worthy of mention - a statute for European party so that the next European election be actually fight on the basis of European issue rather than take the form of national debate on domestic policy . </s>
last but not least , there be the strengthening of institution and instrument for the common economic , social and employment policy , as a counterbalance to European monetary union and the single currency , which we have , of course , already adopt . </s>
in addition to a wide agenda we also want an improve method for the elaboration of this new European treaty . </s>
in the interest of the citizen , we must provide for great transparency in the political process during the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
that be why we demand Parliament 's extensive involvement at all level . </s>
the Union have a two-fold basis of legitimacy ; it be a Union of States but it be also a union of people . </s>
it be high time that this find expression in the method for elaborate a new treaty . </s>
All the more reason for the representative of the European Parliament to participate fully in the preparation group , at ministerial level as well as at the meeting of the European Council , insofar as this Council concern itself with matter pertain to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the national government decide to open this Intergovernmental Conference on @card@ February . </s>
Parliament will deliver its opinion in tomorrow 's mini-sitting , thereby create the pre-conditions for the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
I can deny that many of my fellow MEPs would have prefer to have wait until we have a report from the Portuguese Presidency to hand follow its tour of the capital city , so as to be able to discover if there be any progress towards or impetus for a wide agenda . </s>
however , we have faith in the Portuguese Presidency and we have faith in the commitment it have testify to here to propose additional point for the agenda at the Lisbon Summit in March . </s>
we urge the government to support the Portuguese Presidency in its proposal . </s>
as such , this represent a vote of confidence and we very much hope that we will not be disappoint if we deliver our opinion at this early stage , without know exactly what there be in the way of fresh impetus and what the additional point on the agenda will be . </s>
the opinion we be place before you be a clear signal to the government not to miss the last opportunity we will have before enlargement to implement ambitious reform within the Eu and to raise the level of acceptance of this next European treaty , which be more transparent and provide for the full participation of Parliament . </s>
I too would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Barnier for their cooperation . </s>
I would urge this Parliament to produce a consensus of opinion in favour of adopt our opinion . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , first of all , I would like to express my gratitude for the confidence the previous two speaker have express in the work the Portuguese Presidency have do on this subject . </s>
I think that Portugal 's commitment to drive forward the launching of this Intergovernmental Conference be make very clear at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and subsequently confirm by the Portuguese Foreign Minister 's statement in this Chamber . </s>
in fact , we regard this as a unique opportunity to adapt the union to enlargement , and we must do so in a way that combine a certain degree of ambition with the need to achieve result by the end of this year . </s>
this be the obstacle we all face , which will certainly be heighten by the difficulty certain government will have in get measure through their parliament or , in some case , approve in national referendum . </s>
we must be aware that we face a ratification process which will take around two year and that it be crucial that we guarantee its success . </s>
any failure would be a failure for the whole Union . </s>
we must therefore guarantee that the final outcome of the conference 's work be sufficiently acceptable to all shade of public opinion and to all political hue in the various Member States . </s>
I believe that the mechanism we have propose for this conference have be very well receive by the various government . </s>
the establishment of a preparatory group which I chair be also a response to the concern express by the European Parliament about the scope for its representative to intervene at this stage in the negotiation . </s>
I be therefore count on the work of our friend Mr Broke and Mr Tsatsos , who will doubtless prove extremely valuable participant in the discussion within that group . </s>
I would like to add that our understanding be that they will be able to participate fully , just like any other group member appoint by a Member State or represent the Commission . </s>
I also consider that in choose its Foreign Minister to chair the ministerial group , the Portuguese Presidency be also try to give a signal that it wish to ensure that the President of the European Parliament have a sufficiently high-level representative and not one at a level which could conceivably be interpret as be less worthy of the role of the president of an institution such as this Parliament . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , it be difficult to summarise the contact - and the significance of the contact - that I have have with the various Member States , particularly because I have not yet finish this tour of the capital , in the course of which I have try to find out how the different country see the conference and what their expectation for it be . </s>
nevertheless , I think that I can safely say that the various Member States be willing to open the debate , but not necessarily to conclude it - and this should be make clear from the outset - in line with this Parliament 's interpretation of certain reform that be necessary . </s>
in any event , many government feel that they will be able to accept various topic that I have suggest . </s>
these topic be obviously relate to those institutional issue that the Portuguese Presidency regard as come within its mandate . </s>
I would like to make this quite clear : our mandate , which be give to us in Helsinki , do not , as Portugal see it , cover just the three Amsterdam leftover . </s>
the mandate that we bring back from Helsinki do indeed the three Amsterdam leftover , but it also cover associate institutional issue . </s>
in this context , there be obviously the work relate to the European Union 's institution , and the issue of close cooperation , which be an issue quite closely link to the leftover themselves . </s>
it also cover issue such as the Union 's legal personality and the simplification of the treaty , as well as other issue fundamentally relate to a revision of the Treaty on European Union . </s>
these strike us as be very important , particularly those dealing with the structure of this Parliament itself in a post-enlargement context . </s>
There be also issue such as the provisional measure that will have to be implement if enlargement take place before the end of this parliamentary term , as well as the individual responsibility of the commissioner . </s>
finally , there be a whole raft of issue that we feel can and must be include in the agenda of this conference . </s>
the Member States be apparently open to this possibility . </s>
I would like to say that it be my intention that initiative take during the Portuguese Presidency should start and move ahead quickly and with a substantial input of work . </s>
I do not intend to start the work of the preparatory group merely as a kind of superficial revision of certain issue , act - as Mr Napolitano claim - as a kind of scribe for the position adopt by the various Member States . </s>
I be not seek to be a scribe . </s>
What I be try to do be to put forward concrete proposal for specific issue , with the obvious risk that these proposal may not be accept . </s>
we intend to divide the work of the preparatory group into two stage , in the course of which all of the issue will be study . </s>
the first stage would begin with qualified majority voting , and the member would then try to identify institutional issue relate to the leftover , and only at that point would we address the issue of the Commission and the weighting of vote . </s>
the issue of close cooperation would be include with institutional issue . </s>
in the final part , that be the second stage , we would revisit the set of issue that have already be address , which have be discuss at ministerial meeting , and we would also try to identify the range of new issue that might be add to the agenda . </s>
know whether security and defence issue have already have be fully discuss in the meeting reserve for them would play a crucial role in decide whether we could integrate them into the final stage of the conference . </s>
the same thing could be say about the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
we will see , when the time come , whether the discussion be hold specifically on this issue will lead to conclusion enable us to include this issue in the Intergovernmental Conference , particularly in the second half of this year . </s>
these , in principle , be the presidency 's intention on this matter . </s>
we will be present a report to the Lisbon European Council , which will , of course , have to be of a factual nature , give that we will be make the report in March , only have convene the conference in February . </s>
we hope that the second report , which the presidency will present on its own behalf at the second European Council , will , if possible , be more substantial and contain more specific point concern the treaty text . </s>
we have take note of the proposal put forward by the Commission . </s>
in our presidency capacity , we welcome these proposal and they will be properly address in the discussion at this conference , whatever each Member State may think about the solution the commission itself be put forward in its proposal . </s>
we hope that we will be able to include all the suggestion and document that Member States may send us on this matter . </s>
in fact , we shall be request the Member States to provide us as quickly as possible with their contribution to this conference rather than have them arrive at the last moment . </s>
of course the conference will always be open to suggestion from the Member States , but we would like them to state their position as promptly as possible . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , this be what we think the real work of this conference will be . </s>
we be genuinely determine that , where the Intergovernmental Conference be concern , the Portuguese Presidency should be exercise effectively and seriously . </s>
we also hope to be able to hand over to the French Presidency something tangible and as representative as possible of the link that may be establish between the Member States in the course of our work . </s>
Mr President , the Group of the European people 's party be not satisfy with the conclusion of the European Council in Helsinki . </s>
it seem to us that the agenda lack content , because our group be think in term of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union 's institution . </s>
in Helsinki , the government approve the idea that , as long as the European Union consist of few than @card@ States , a minimal reform would be sufficient . </s>
with more than @card@ , a deep reform would become necessary . </s>
the European Council in Helsinki itself approve enlargement involve @card@ new Member States . </s>
it be therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiation with @card@ country while contemplate a minimal reform . </s>
we be therefore think in term of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deep reform of the Union . </s>
have say this , Mr President , this Parliament be hold this debate today because we do not want to delay the start of the conference . </s>
in theory , we could have do so . </s>
we could have vote on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have be able to start on the 14th . </s>
however , we do not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the government and the candidate country that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement . </s>
Mr President , I be very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it have earn great respect in this Assembly . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency share many of this Parliament 's aspiration and have commit itself to do everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference be widen to include other essential issue . </s>
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament be not an aspiration to gain benefit for the European Parliament itself . </s>
however , the European Parliament will be reinforce politically by the Treaty result from this Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
this be for one very simple reason : accord to the agreement make in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issue , which be currently decide unanimously , be decide by a qualified majority . </s>
therefore , the number of issue decide by a qualified majority will increase . </s>
it be already establish within the Community acquis that those legislative issue which be decide by a qualified majority be also subject to codecision with Parliament . </s>
therefore , since the qualified majority will be extend , there will also be more codecision with Parliament . </s>
however , this Parliament would not be fulfill its role as a supranational European institution if it do not consider the political design of the Union . </s>
that it be what we be do . </s>
we believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issue need to be deal with . </s>
these include , amongst other , the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issue , which have make much progress recently , but which must be incorporate into the Treaty . </s>
of course there be also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work begin on its wording yesterday , which I believe have start very positively . </s>
we be go to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see be European as an advantage and that European citizen have certain fundamental right which be connect to the Union 's institution . </s>
therefore , Mr President , our proposal , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposal of the Commission , which have produce an excellent document - and I be happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - be go to be use as conference document . </s>
we will talk about this on another day . </s>
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People 's Party , Mr President , be ready to give that green light . </s>
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be support the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteur on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee . </s>
we be give a positive opinion on the convene of the IGC precisely because we have be impress by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which have take on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widen . </s>
the Amsterdam leftover be not a very good term , because they be very important subject in themselves . </s>
let us call them the first three subject of the IGC . </s>
these first three subject be very important but they be subject which be explore in detail by our Member States during the last IGC . </s>
they do not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine month of further study . </s>
they need a political deal . </s>
it be more a question of nine minute , perhaps nine hour if it be difficult , lock away together in a room to reach a solution on these subject , not nine month . </s>
in those circumstance it would be silly not to widen the agenda . </s>
There be other issue that should fruitfully be look at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new country . </s>
nobody be ask for a Christmas tree . </s>
nobody be ask for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subject be debate . </s>
however , there be six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subject which it would be very appropriate and useful to address . </s>
There be time . </s>
remember the IGC that lead to the Single European Act . </s>
it last only five month . </s>
the IGC that lead to the enormous Maastricht Treaty last a year . </s>
only the Amsterdam Treaty last a year and a half and that be because everyone know you have to wait for the result of the British election if you be go to have any outcome from that IGC so that be a different reason . </s>
a year be ample time to address a large number of issue and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial point that we wish to be add to the agenda . </s>
I be please to see that the Commission share our view . </s>
the Commission have just publish its opinion and it have do exactly what Parliament ask of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty article . </s>
I thank the Commission for do that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission say . </s>
I think there be some gap in what they have put forward . </s>
Nonetheless the Commission have provide a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who be here with us today for do that . </s>
they have lay out for the public to see some of the crucial issue that we be go to have to address in this IGC . </s>
that be all to the good . </s>
the Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission be pull in the same direction for a wide agenda . </s>
I wish you every success , President of the Council , in make sure that the European Council agree to this agenda and that on Valentine 's day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspice and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency take over , by the end of this year . </s>
we should no longer be worry that the agenda for the IGC will be restrict . </s>
that be one of the political conclusion that we must draw from the grave decision of @card@ Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relation with a partner . </s>
it make it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental right . </s>
it be already strange within the convention that be draft the charter to see representative of some Member States , especially Britain and France , seek to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty . </s>
it be vital that the IGC prepare the way to accept the installation of a fundamental right regime within the Treaty . </s>
One part of this be to improve the access of the citizen to the Court . </s>
another be for the Union itself to sign up to the European convention . </s>
another be clearly for national parliament and national political party to find a reinforce role that they can play inside European Union affair and to share the shoulder of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy . </s>
my group strongly welcome the IGC and will be contribute to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent . </s>
Mr President , the Group of the green / European Free Alliance believe that the European Parliament 's decision to rush headlong into give its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermine the political significance of the request for talk with the Council , and in the end , make it rather irrelevant . </s>
we would have prefer to have have great clarification of the agenda and more guarantee on the method before give our opinion , and frankly , we do not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency show towards the European Parliament by schedule the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine 's day , the first day of the Strasbourg part-session . </s>
moreover , give that this opinion be quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be vote for it . </s>
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it be quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform . </s>
the event in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principle which provide base all the Member States . </s>
it be also distressing to think that the initiative take against Austria be actually the result of an agreement between government and that , in any case , the European Union and its institution would not have have the mean or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and rectify the course of event . </s>
we must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference , and I firmly hope that this opinion , that be give reluctantly , will not mean that the European Parliament cease to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference be not merely a technical exercise , but rouse the passion that we see a few hour ago in Parliament . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , to my mind , it can be say often or loud enough that what the Council have adopt in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference be completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful . </s>
after all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that be to say , we be negotiate or be on the point of take up negotiation with @card@ state , and together we have reach a stage at which close European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future . </s>
How , though , be the union to be enlarge if we do not do the job properly now , i. e. before enlargement take place ? </s>
that be why we as a group be in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently need and hope that it actually come up with the good that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European union in the not too distant future . </s>
my group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , note with satisfaction that the Council Presidency be far from happy with the current state of affair . </s>
you can therefore rest assure that the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left be commit to see that the Union get on with the task in hand . </s>
What we be talk about be nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe , and , in particular , a Europe that the citizen truly regard as be theirs , because they be instrumental in shape it and because the care and concern , the problem and issue they face on a daily basis be also take seriously by politician . </s>
the politics of closed door and private discussion ; all that must be consign to the past once and for all . </s>
that be why we need transparency . </s>
I believe it fall to you , as President-in-Office of the Council , to see to it that the train do not keep roll on as before , leave the people behind on the platform as if they be ignorant as to the content of the treaty . </s>
we believe it be imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizen with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference be go , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involve in the overall reform process to a far great extent . </s>
we also take the view that the political decision-maker must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizen in referendum , once the Intergovernmental Conference be over , whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe be to continue to develop in the future . </s>
in this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizen and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy . </s>
There be another central issue relate to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to . </s>
as a member of the convention that have now take up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I wish to make the follow point clear : neither my group nor I be content with make a solemn announcement about the Charter . </s>
after all , what will the citizen say if we make a solemn announcement about right to them but they be unable to take legal action in respect of these right as individual ? </s>
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis face the Union . </s>
the poor turnout at the European election really should have be warn enough for everyone . </s>
What we need be visible right for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be make legally binding for all the citizen of the Union . </s>
together we should work towards this goal in the interest of the citizen , and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference be that the relevant Cologne decision will be revise here at the end of the year . </s>
of course , we be also talk about effectiveness of decision and function institution in a Union of @card@ plus Member States . </s>
we will not achieve this just by undertake a mini reform , as the Council have resolve to do , and that be why all institution must come under scrutiny . </s>
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the great possible attention to equal right for the major and small States . </s>
this be something I would stress , particularly with my be an MEP for one of the major Member States . </s>
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposal they have put forward and I be certain that comprehensive discussion with the citizen will ensue here in the European Parliament , on all the issue you have raise . </s>
There be one final issue I would like to raise . </s>
Parliament 's opinion expressly demand amendment to the Treaty in the area of economic policy . </s>
it be indeed the case that globalisation of national economy , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associate stability pact have lead to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making process . </s>
What we need most of all be to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union 's policy to date . </s>
it be all about create a socially just Europe . </s>
a socially just Europe be still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority be place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union 's policy . </s>
hence , to my mind , that include have the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty , which define the union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition . </s>
the same apply to Article @card@ , in my view , for the European Central Bank must at last be give the political task as enshrine in the Treaty , of use its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment . </s>
Mr President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group consider that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the Helsinki Council , i. e. focus strictly on the issue of decision make in an enlarged Europe , must be adhere to . </s>
it must be adhere to in the interest of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement . </s>
this be why we can subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what be more , widen it in the wrong direction , i. e. move towards centralisation and an ever tight European system . </s>
our group have therefore table a raft of amendment which , when take together , form a real alternative resolution . </s>
in them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pay great attention to national sovereignty . </s>
we deplore the fact that the Commission , in its opinion of @card@ January , limit itself to follow the routine path of a standardise Europe enlarge towards the East , a centralise superstate operate on the basis of majority decision . </s>
the federalist imagine that they be thereby go to create unity through constraint , but this be a totally superficial concept . </s>
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation impose by the improper use of majority decision can lead only to the whole thing explode . </s>
furthermore , the centralise European system , as we can see it develop today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation , erode nation and , in erode nation , erode the national patriotism which form the basis of our will to defend ourselves . </s>
the Europe which result from this be not strong but weak , as it no longer know what it be or what it be defend . </s>
this be why we have always say that enlargement be possible only if the diversity and freedom of the people of Europe be clearly recognise , i. e. by adopt flexibility found upon the respect of national sovereignty . </s>
we be delighted today to see the progress this idea have enjoy in certain circle , one which be still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission . </s>
a flexible Europe , be a Europe which respect its national democracy , which rely on the support of its nation , its national patriotism , instead of continually persecute them . </s>
it be this that give us the determination to defend ourselves against external threat , not the constrain , convoluted decision make procedure which the Commission think it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
Mr President , I be speak on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the council that he have see what Parliament 's opinion be . </s>
it be no coincidence that the last intervention be the only one that be completely oppose to further European integration . </s>
I say this without be the slight bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group , but it be no coincidence that the European Council 's decision be support by those who be , after all , in Parliament because - and this be a highly respectable position - they be fight against further integration . </s>
this be the message that Parliament be send to the Council . </s>
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliment to those already offer - can convey Parliament 's message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine 's day . </s>
in any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda . </s>
this message must be very clear ; this be how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow . </s>
we shall give an opinion - which be technically and legally necessary - on convene the IGC on @card@ February , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content . </s>
just consider the fact : we look at Austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock market , Mr President : give that the euro , that great undertaking , have fall @card@ % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , I will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizen that the only subject open to negotiation be the number of commissioner or similar issue . </s>
There be clearly a more ambitious goal . </s>
we Radicals have table amendment which we be submit to the house in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mention Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be do , I. E. , that the European Parliament should also be involve in draw up the European Constitution and that a proposal be make for the European Parliament to adopt the amendment to the Treaty . </s>
we know that there be other topic : for example , many member have subscribe , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institution , an issue that we believe should be consider at least at IGC level . </s>
in conclusion , I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once , so that thank also to the effort of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be revise . </s>
otherwise , the challenge really would be lose , not just for the present but also for many year to come . </s>
Mr President , the President of the Commission be not be quite honest when he talk last week about the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
he say that there would always be unanimity on social question but , in the Commission 's draft , plan be quite explicitly be make for majority decision-making on issue relate to social security and on taxis connect with the internal market . </s>
this mean that it will be possible for major part of the social system in the Member States to be change by a majority in Brussels , even if a unanimous French National Assembly , a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this . </s>
and , in this regard , you be go to the heart of democracy as it relate to distribution policy and people 's social condition , which be what voter wish to influence when they go to the poll . </s>
these be matter which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voter and no longer be able to change on election day . </s>
Brussels know good . </s>
Mr Prodi also announce great transparency , but his draft regulation signal a clear backward step , and that be not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman . </s>
today , the Commission be oblige , on a case-by-case basis , to weigh consideration of confidentiality against people 's demand for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the Commission 's regulation be adopt , the Commission will be entitle to lock away whole category of document without have to give them specific consideration . </s>
There be also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away document of a kind which be at present publicly available in a range of Member States . </s>
under the banner of &quot; progress towards transparency &quot; , a range of document be be lock away from the general public . </s>
it be , of course , thoroughly Orwellian . </s>
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which be not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public . </s>
Mr Prodi secure positive comment for a proposal which would otherwise have be meet with criticism , for the new draft regulation present as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to document in the Commission 's possession . </s>
There follow , however , a long , long list of exception , and there be legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exception . </s>
the French text contain the word &quot; refuse &quot; and the English text the word &quot; shall &quot; , which mean that the Commission be to keep secret such information as be today available to the public , for example in my own country . </s>
in addition , we have a flexible clause concern the efficiency of the negotiation and of the institution , which may be use for any purpose whatsoever . </s>
it be therefore ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Portuguese Council Presidency 's account have give me the distinct impression that we be approach this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered idea and a high degree of openness . </s>
we as a European Parliament will use these opportunity to see that our issue be give the attention they deserve . </s>
the preparation the Commission have make so far be on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament 's motion be anything to go by . </s>
There be more to be say on that score . </s>
it be crucially important for this Intergovernmental conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency . </s>
in the end , it be only by have these three thing in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizen . </s>
at the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union . </s>
if we have be have a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only go to show how important this be . </s>
the European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government elect to impose a total blockade . </s>
this be an important sign that majority voting be a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union be be able to function come what may . </s>
this be particularly important where enlargement be concern , and legislation and in relation to treaty , which entail change be make to legislation . </s>
of course we also want to extend the European Parliament 's corresponding power in this area . </s>
in addition , we as a European Parliament be go to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there be a lack of supervision in this area . </s>
the Finance Ministers behave as if they be in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro @card@ Council , which be an unacceptable way to go on . </s>
unlike Mrs Kaufmann , I be not in favour of extend supervision over the European Central Bank as I be an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank . </s>
however , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side . </s>
furthermore , the tripartite relationship of Commission , Council and Parliament must be restore to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the Council be in sole charge far more than should have be the case , especially in relation to the crudely fashion crisis management measure , for which the Commission alone have responsibility . </s>
the overall plan fail to do justice to any of this . </s>
we must examine whether any change be need to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency have agree to initiate deliberation on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate . </s>
There be another point I would just like to draw your attention to . </s>
the debate we be have these day , on a certain European country 's government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare-orientated leaning of the European union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental right must also be incorporate into the Treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabilise factor . </s>
I would urge those who be still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now be not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matter of fundamental right . </s>
the European Union need few , if any , new instrument , and it do not need any new competence . </s>
What it do need be instrument that will enable it to put its competence into practice . </s>
for this reason , we must ensure that the instrument have the effect of enable us to carry out , on behalf of the citizen , the task we have already formally be set in the Treaty . </s>
in my view , that be the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference have to concentrate its energy on . </s>
if we succeed in make progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarge the European Union . </s>
this be the crux of the matter . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I be confident that this will be tackle in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage . </s>
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs . </s>
( it ) Mr President-in-Office , on listen to the various intervention , you have understand that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leader of Parliament 's political group , the decision prevail - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency , instead of create more difficulty by postpone the start of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
I can assure you that it be not easy to achieve this , last week in the Committee I chair , but we eventually decide to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager . </s>
you speak to us about the start of your tour around the various capital city and tell us about the difficulty that some government have in reach a consensus in their own country , and therefore in their parliament . </s>
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we have a very worthwhile day of discussion and dialogue with the representative of the @card@ national parliament , which be represent by competent and exacting delegation . </s>
the aim be not to draw conclusion - it be impossible to draw any - but the debate be certainly very encouraging . </s>
we need to be careful and be sure that national government try to convince their respective parliament to ratify solution that correspond to the Union 's requirement for growth and that they do not hide behind suppose resistance put up by the parliament to avoid sign appropriate conclusion at the Intergovernmental Conference table . </s>
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliament for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
yesterday , we also discuss the Commission , represent by Commissioner Barnier , who give its opinion . </s>
this effort be appreciate , even if different view be later express as regard the proposal , and moreover , Mr President-in-Office , you also express different view . </s>
nevertheless , we must stress that many people be aware , as they be yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe , a risk that be , moreover , indicate in an interview that surely escape no one 's attention , owe to the authority of the person be interview - Jacques Delors . </s>
we must , therefore , ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic base of the Union and how to strengthen - and this have be discuss in the House even today , with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principle , value and right underpin the Union and the role of the political institution of the Union , with regard , among other thing , to run the economy . </s>
we be count on the Portuguese Presidency , we be count on ourselves and we be count on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debate on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement . </s>
only a strengthened Europe be immune to political opportunist who exploit dissatisfaction . </s>
that be why sweeping reform be necessary and , hence , a widen IGC agenda . </s>
the Finnish Presidency only listen to minimalist government and , unfortunately , turn a deaf ear to this Parliament . </s>
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor 's book . </s>
it be of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join force for this IGC . </s>
in many way , they share the same interest and the same insight . </s>
an essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament 's right of assent to the forthcoming change to the Treaty . </s>
of all priority , this one be the most pressing . </s>
What be the Commission 's verdict on this ? </s>
it also mean that our Parliament President and the two representative should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the work party , but also at the same political level as the Commission . </s>
There be no reason whatsoever why representative directly elect by citizen should be involve in talk at a low level than the Commission . </s>
not only do we owe the sweeping reform to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves . </s>
if we allow Europe to be water down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire . </s>
Mr President , there be day when I really can understand this Parliament . </s>
it seem to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation . </s>
after have restrict , on its own initiative , its participation in the IGC to two minor seat , Parliament be now give up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC . </s>
the fact be , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rush to give its opinion , Parliament be give up the only lever which the Treaty accord it , i. e. demand a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declare its opinion . </s>
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 February , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on @card@ February , and thus force an agenda that be complete , and therefore consistent , on the Council . </s>
a good dose of hypocrisy be need to overlook our weakness today . </s>
hypocrisy to be regret bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC be not equal to the issue , since in our haste , with blameworthy naivety , we be stop ourselves force through this more ambitious agenda . </s>
if there be a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political group which so want this haste will be accountable for this . </s>
whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself be go to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shed a little light on the debate , the venue for decision be now go to move to the @card@ Member States of the Union . </s>
I therefore invite the member of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last November rule that the future of Europe be deserving of debate that go far wide than the Amsterdam leftover , to take up their pilgrim ' staff and go and convince their own government that this IGC must be extend , since this be permit accord to the resolution of the Helsinki Council . </s>
because of the situation in Austria , this be a dark day for Europe . </s>
it make us realise that the victory of democracy be never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convince . </s>
in order to assert our fundamental value , they need to be lay down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution . </s>
Mr President , the draft resolution we be now discuss require , precisely as before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involve radical reform of the institution . </s>
the forthcoming enlargement of the Union be use as an argument for this . </s>
I be convince that this be an error of judgement . </s>
a federal and centralist Eu which intervene more and more in the government of the Member States be in actual fact less well place for enlargement . </s>
a flexible Eu which concentrate on few but important area and which respect national difference and national democracy have a good chance of embrace a significantly great number of country . </s>
paragraph D of the draft resolution require a more coordinate and more open economic policy at Eu level . </s>
it be not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talk about monetary union . </s>
this text say nothing about the major democratic and political problem involve monetary union and the European Central Bank . </s>
this be untenable . </s>
if there be a desire to make the Eu more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be reconsider . </s>
the Central Bank must be place under political control so that the direction to be take by monetary policy may be govern by political objective such as high employment and prosperity . </s>
public control of the Central Bank must be improve if this be to become possible . </s>
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examine and discard so that we might have a uniform policy which have prosperity as its primary objective . </s>
article @card@ of the Treaty , prohibit currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be remove so that damaging currency speculation may be check by mean of political control . </s>
in the majority of Eu country , there be now government dominate by social democrat . </s>
it be remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them be demand any change in the direction take by monetary union . </s>
it also , of course , damage credibility when it be state that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital . </s>
the resolution require the European Parliament to have increase influence over the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
it be , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference be and will remain a conference of the Member States . </s>
it be the Member States ' parliament , or people vote in referendum , who be to direct the development of the Treaty . </s>
it be therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be give any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification . </s>
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have propose an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally have propose a lot of amendment to broaden it . </s>
nevertheless , the event of the last few day show that all those who have make basic criticism of the way enlargement and the revision of the treaty have be plan be right . </s>
the Union can be enlarge to @card@ without address the matter of whether Europe have certain joint principle and value , whether it come down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it have a great ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in way that have yet to be define , that want to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world . </s>
this be what be and be mean by the call for a European Constitution . </s>
the amendment of the treaty be , however , limited to a review of some internal rule , which be necessary and important , but do not answer the fundamental question : what be Europe , what be its common principle and therefore , its objective and limitation ? </s>
however , politics exact its revenge , and have be throw out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it come back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of Austria , since a party be enter the Austrian government which seem to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and form of racism . </s>
and it be not a question of link with the past ; it be a question of prospect for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and leave take a divide stand on this . </s>
I belong to a world , the world of Liberal Catholics , which be not left-wing but which hold as dear as anyone else the value of tolerance and common European value , and will have nothing to do with policy that reject these value . </s>
the Council have do well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these value in a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in a European Constitution , then we shall construct a Europe without a solid , lasting base . </s>
Commissioner Barnier , I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representative of the Portuguese Presidency share these value : make the most of the chance you be give by the December Conference to include these subject and principle , because this be the only way we will build a lasting Europe . </s>
Mr President , I be in the happy position of be able to refer to a couple of striking contribution from a small group of Nordic sceptic and opponent of the drastic and grow integration process which , look long and hard at , threaten the whole of democratic Europe . </s>
I be think of the contribution from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contain a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiative dictate by the desire for power and point in the direction of a centralist and federalist Eu . </s>
they rightly include the problem with monetary union and centralist government and present a number of alternative democratic principle . </s>
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country , Denmark , take it for grant that , when we enlarge the circle of Eu country to include the envisage huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union , we can at the same time pursue further integration in depth , that be to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe . </s>
however , that be precisely what be happen . </s>
with every single geographical extension to the area cover by the Eu , we have see how extension in breadth have be follow by intensive extension in depth , and that be precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee be contemplate , especially in paragraph 7 which say that there should be more thorough integration in depth . </s>
in the light of development in recent day , it might well be ask what we really be to do about these intergovernmental conference and treaty amendment when government leader - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decision in relation to an independent Member State entail intervention in that Member State 's democratic process . </s>
you can think what you like about Mr Haider , and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you can just intervene in an independent and friendly country 's democratic process . </s>
when we hold intergovernmental conference and consider change to the Treaty , we must take into account the fact that the Eu be develop all the time , sometimes in contravention of the Treaty , as we have just see . </s>
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon . </s>
on @card@ February , we will see the launch of the IGC which be to be complete by the end of @card@ . </s>
this be a big task but it can be do . </s>
I think it be generally agree here this afternoon across all group that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement . </s>
in other word we need to go further than what have be refer to as the important &quot; Amsterdam leftover &quot; . </s>
these include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to area of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour large state and the number of commissioner in an enlarged Europe . </s>
in relation to the latter point , Ireland want to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States join . </s>
we be prepare to consider re-weighting the vote in the Council of Ministers , provide that the large Member States be willing to agree to every Member state have a full and equal Member of the Commission . </s>
I feel I speak for many small country when I make that particular point . </s>
at the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible division of the treaty into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution . </s>
we would accept the division of the treaty provide it would not limit the control the small Member States have in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty . </s>
in other word , if we be not represent fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussion . </s>
so we be watch that entire point extremely carefully . </s>
we look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to see its content . </s>
the Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , have set the number of European Parliament member at @card@ and a debate be need in this Parliament on how that number will be distribute among the enlarged Europe . </s>
Mr President , I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos / Leinen resolution , which clearly express both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible . </s>
in any case , this emerge from the favourable schedule we decide upon . </s>
I think that , under the present rule of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation . </s>
on the contrary , we should concentrate on work out persuasive proposal on the necessary reform , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposal be worthy of note . </s>
we must use dialogue at every political level , include of course dialogue with the national parliament . </s>
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reform . </s>
Parliament 's representative at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiate that , with the Union 's institutional change , we be face with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union . </s>
they must therefore realise that such issue can be decide on the rationale of bargaining alone . </s>
the issue to be deal with at this Intergovernmental Conference be exceptionally sensitive . </s>
it may be easy to come up with solution , but what matter be how well those solution will stand up in the long term . </s>
I will mention two point that may create tension . </s>
one be the balance which have so far be maintain between large and small country . </s>
Europe be not , nor can it become a classic federal state . </s>
the solution we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union , which be a union of state and people . </s>
the other area of conflict be more difficult . </s>
owe to the imminent increase in membership , the body of the future European Union must become more effective . </s>
this mean that they must function more simply and more rapidly . </s>
by its very nature , however , the European union be , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution . </s>
possibility for fast and more simple operation do exist . </s>
of course they do , but they be not unlimited . </s>
if the limit be exceed because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimise basis of the European Union will suffer . </s>
I be , however , optimistic . </s>
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate need to be widen . </s>
the most important issue with regard to this be internal differentiation within the Union . </s>
it be unfortunate that there have be no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union , which will , however , be necessary if the Union be to enlarge as planned . </s>
the Commission 's former president , Jacques Delors , have once again publicly raise the issue of a European Confederation . </s>
he have also say that the country in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institution , for the sake of clarity . </s>
the Commission 's current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward idea along the same line . </s>
last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopt a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it propose a system of concentric ring for Europe : the onion skin model . </s>
in the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the question of differentiation and flexibility . </s>
both enlargement and the achievement of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric ring , as propose by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party . </s>
my colleague , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already speak , somewhat sceptically , about some aspect of the matter in hand . </s>
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-govern region . </s>
this have be give inadequate attention and there be many thing to be concern about . </s>
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implication of enlargement in respect of this Parliament . </s>
a ceiling of @card@ have be prescribe as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly . </s>
if you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality , six seat for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitant , you already have the situation where Luxembourg with @card@ people have more member in this Chamber than Wales , which be a partly self-govern region of the United Kingdom . </s>
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , have eight seat in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen . </s>
now what be go to happen if we retain a ceiling of @card@ , bring in @card@ % more population over time , and then adopt the Commission 's , I think ill-considered , proposition , that there should be a European list of candidate . </s>
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ? </s>
it will become totally invisible ! </s>
member of this House should not in these circumstance be in the least surprised that in these discussion , people in Scotland and other such country be ask whether enlargement should not also take the form of admit new Member States from within existing one . </s>
a grow body of opinion in Scotland hold that view . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , today 's debate have a special political significance . </s>
we be not discuss the substance of the agenda , that be the item already include or those that we all wish to see include . </s>
we be state the political position of the European Parliament on convene the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
There be nothing new here , apart from one aspect : the fact that with this opinion - assume it be approve tomorrow - the European Parliament be adopt a positive strategy to assist in widen the IGC agenda . </s>
this also demonstrate its willingness to contribute , by mean of its two representative and its President , to reach a more satisfactory final solution to this revision of the Treaty . </s>
this opinion be positive about the convene of the IGC and yet critical , as it would inevitably have to be , about the substance of this agenda . </s>
the constitutional framework have now be clarify . </s>
Everybody be aware of the Portuguese Presidency 's positive and ambitious approach , and they be also aware of the European Parliament 's position . </s>
the Commission have just draw up a document in which it also explain some of its view , some of which be present as option , which mean that the ball , to use a sporting expression , be now in the European Council 's court . </s>
therefore , Mr President , and my dear friend Dr Seixas da Costa , my question be this : without wish to know more than we need to at the moment - in order not to compromise our common goal - I would like to know , from the contact you have make during your tour of the capital and from your own point of view , if there be any useful information you could give us . </s>
I ask this because at the moment our lobbying work be more important than our work within the European Parliament . </s>
this involve raise the awareness of the government that be most reluctant to include further item on this IGC agenda , and persuade them to do so . </s>
my second question be for Commissioner Barnier . </s>
it relate to the Commission 's initiative . </s>
I be one of its critic , as I feel that the Commission should have go further at the Helsinki European Council . </s>
I also feel , however , that the Commission do an excellent job , whether or not you agree with the solution put forward in the document adopt on @card@ January . </s>
however , why be the Commission concentrate only on the Amsterdam leftover or perhaps on some other point ? </s>
why be it confine itself to state that other issue could be include , specifically the Charter of Fundamental Rights or common foreign and security policy issue ? </s>
I would therefore challenge the Commission to move forward and to begin , at least by provide alternative , to work on these other point , which will perhaps later on form part of the agenda and contribute to its success . </s>
it could do this in the same thorough way in which it have work on the proposal we be already familiar with . </s>
I shall finish by offer my warm congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
they do not have an easy task , but I know that it be in safe hand . </s>
Mr President , to say that the European Union be at a crossroad be no doubt nothing new . </s>
it have be say many time . </s>
this time , however , it be true . </s>
we have establish the single currency - which be extremely positive - and we be face enlargement . </s>
the question be if we will undertake enlargement whether we be prepare or not . </s>
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform ? </s>
that be the debate , and this question must be address in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method . </s>
it be clear that the Council , for the moment , have not opt for enlarge with deep reform in place . </s>
that put enlargement in danger . </s>
it jeopardise any prospect of political union and , of course , it be difficult for the public to understand . </s>
the Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement build on firm foundation , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further . </s>
the Council be consult us and Parliament be give its opinion . </s>
we want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one . </s>
Must there be an IGC ? </s>
of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the agenda must go much further . </s>
we must be much more daring with regard to the issue deal with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic . </s>
be much more democratic mean great participation by the European Parliament and allow the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative . </s>
we must clearly set firm objective . </s>
the functionalist approach be over , for good or for bad . </s>
the functionalist approach have bring us to this point . </s>
have we achieve result ? </s>
yes , but the point be to make a qualitative leap and , speak in political term , this , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , mean convince the other Community partner that to fall short would be the bad thing we could do at the moment . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman of the House , at this stage , follow this debate which I have listen to most attentively and with great interest , I should like to make a few comment in addition to the guideline and the statement which it have be my honour to present to you in the course of recent week in the company of President Prodi . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , in the report which they produce after extremely thorough and meticulous work , your two rapporteur , Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen , propose that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article @card@ of the Treaty and thus , if this opinion be adopt , the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on @card@ February , as suggest by the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
as far as we be concern , after produce the opinion expect from the Commission , accord to this same Article @card@ of the Treaty , we be please that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipate . </s>
we know , I know myself , that the week we have before us will be useful to us . </s>
I would just like to make a few comment , after read the draft opinion and after listen to the speaker on behalf of the various group . </s>
firstly , lady and gentleman , the Commission understand the anxiety express by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda . </s>
I understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limit , and yet I feel , as I say to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on return from Helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate . </s>
indeed , it be in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission frame for its own opinion , but use all the term thereof , plus everything between the line . </s>
we have not restrict ourselves to the three so-called leftover , which be , in any case , an incorrect label . </s>
I do not like the term ' leftover ' any more than Richard Corbett do . </s>
it give the impression that they be three minor or insignificant subject whereas in fact they be three extremely serious and important subject , and difficult , so difficult that we do not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth . </s>
as far as we be concern - I be respond to Mr Seguro who express concern about this just now - we have not restrict ourselves to these three subject , even though I do consider them as priority , and consider that they must be deal with now . </s>
they be the first but they be not the only subject , Mr Seguro , that the conference must deal with . </s>
we have deal with other subject and we have mention our idea that other subject may be deal with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement . </s>
we be ready for it , whether it be a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , on which work have start , the CFSP and the consequence for the institution of the current defence policy negotiation , or an extremely difficult subject on which we be continue to work : reorganisation of the treaty . </s>
I have hear many comment on the Commission 's opinion , which mention all these subject and deal with many of them in depth , with specific indication of new draft article , but no one have say that we be go beyond the Helsinki mandate . </s>
this prove that it be possible to go into issue in depth while respect this mandate , by use the term lay down in the mandate and all the opening which it offer . </s>
as regard the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceeding , I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in say that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiate group in which your two representative , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok , be go to be work . </s>
of course , the final trade-off will be make , as in any institutional negotiation , and I think this be no bad thing , at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hand . </s>
let me point out , in pass , that the Commission President , Mr Prodi , be also a Council member , and he have every intention of make use of this position and this role , alongside the Heads of State and Government , particularly during the final period . </s>
however , these Council proceeding must be carefully prepare . </s>
this preparatory work , this fine-tuning , must not be omit , lady and gentleman of the House . </s>
I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it be extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limit to technical detail . </s>
I think that all of us , the personal representative of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs , your two representative , and myself , as a representative of the Commission , will be go into matter in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participate , that the last trade-off must be make . </s>
throughout this conference , lady and gentleman , it be not only the status of the negotiator which be important , but the quality of what they will be say . </s>
and once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledge to the two representative of the European Parliament , prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok say count for a lot in these negotiation . </s>
I be sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as I be concern , in my current position , I shall ensure that the contribution of your two representative be listen to and respect throughout these negotiation . </s>
I be sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiation any more than the Commission will be . </s>
we now await , therefore , with great interest , lady and gentleman of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament 's priority and practical proposal for these negotiation . </s>
it be extremely important that the two European institution involve in these negotiation , the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other , alongside the Council member , explain clearly to the citizen of the Union continually , every day , what the issue of this conference be and what response we advocate in our capacity as European institution responsible for ensure both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest . </s>
in the come month , lady and gentleman of the House , the Commission will therefore be work in close cooperation , on good term , with your two representative , Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok , in order to reconcile our point of view , if need be . </s>
quite probably , our point of view and our position will not always be the same . </s>
There will probably be difference of opinion , that would be only normal . </s>
the important thing be that we be consistent , and I have be commit to work towards this consistency ever since I accept the position of Commissioner . </s>
our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subject , be to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiation forward successfully . </s>
this will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , I feel we have the same ambition for these negotiation and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union . </s>
finally , I should like to make three additional comment , quite briefly , Mr President . </s>
firstly , to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it take yesterday in bring together the competent representative of national parliament , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate . </s>
such dialogue between the national parliament , the European Parliament and ourselves be extremely important . </s>
I have say , furthermore , that I would play my part by visit each of the national parliament . </s>
tomorrow , I shall be in London . </s>
in a fortnight 's time , I shall be in Berlin . </s>
in three week ' time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another . </s>
I feel this initiative you have take be extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for take it . </s>
my second brief comment be to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr Seixas da Costa , for his proactive approach . </s>
indeed , the comment which have just be make express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the Portuguese Presidency can be just an interim presidency . </s>
it will have to initiate these negotiation . </s>
we be well aware that they can be complete within these six month and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reach before the end of the year @card@ . </s>
not only that a conclusion can be reach , but that a successful conclusion can be reach , which be not necessarily the same thing . </s>
conclude negotiation be not the same as conclude them successfully . </s>
the handover will have be make , but the condition in which the handover be go to be make , by yourself , Mr President , and by the Portuguese Presidency , be go to be extremely important , as be the nature of this handover . </s>
it be all the work which be go to be carry out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few month , which be extremely important . </s>
we have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency 's ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectation thereof . </s>
Portugal be a small country , but be a small country be no reason why one may not have great ambition . </s>
after have hear Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiation . </s>
it can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few month . </s>
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topic of these negotiation . </s>
these be difficult subject , subject relate to institutional policy and mechanism which be not always easy to explain . </s>
All the more reason for member of the European Parliament , Ministers , commissioner to devote a little time to explain matter to the citizen , to public debate . </s>
as far as the Commission be concern , it will , lady and gentleman , be take initiative to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate . </s>
cross-border service the next item be the joint debate on the follow report : A5-0007 / @card@ by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the post of worker who be third-country national for the provision of cross-border service ( COM ( @card@ ) 3 - C4-0095 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) ; A5-0012 / @card@ by Mrs Berger , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on a proposal for a Council directive extend the freedom to provide cross-border service to third-country national establish in the Community ( COM ( @card@ ) 3 - C4-0096 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) . </s>
- ( de ) Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to apologise for be a little hoarse today , but we Austrian MEPs have have a lot of explain and talk to do . </s>
I would first like to say how indebted I be to the Commission for seize the initiative , and for the two draft directive we be discuss here today . </s>
it have thereby succeed in close two serious loophole in the internal market which be of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country national in the European Union who be here as worker or on a self-employed basis . </s>
the current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - be that there be in fact judgement from the European Court of Justice relate to employee , I refer in particular to those relate to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst . </s>
these have , in fact , clarify that the freedom to provide service must allow for third-country national to be take on as employee of cross-border service and this without have to obtain work permit . </s>
however , the European Court of Justice do not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirement and condition of residence and consequently the Member States be unable to clarify this issue . </s>
furthermore , not all Member States have abide by the Court of Justice 's verdict with regard to the lapse of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barrier in place in respect of cross-border service ; barrier that be often impossible to overcome , especially for the small company . </s>
the situation as far as self-employed people be concern be that current Community invest legal right do not afford third-country national the right to provide cross-border service . </s>
There be no doubt that we need a legislative act here . </s>
both draft directive seek to facilitate the freedom to provide service for Eu enterprise . </s>
it be not about establish original right for third-country national model on freedom of movement . </s>
all provision , i. e. issue relate to entry into the Eu and to the law pertain to residence right , should be regard as ancillary to this freedom to provide service . </s>
I , together with the European Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , be therefore of the opinion that the Commission have choose the right legal base and that the opposite view , as express in the report produce by the Council 's Legal Service , be inappropriate . </s>
consequently , I do not see that there be any real obstacle to the Council be be able to move matter on quickly as far as these two draft directive be concern . </s>
I also believe that Parliament 's propose amendment should make it easy for the Council to adopt the directive as oppose to the Commission 's proposal . </s>
Many of our amendment relate back to concern that be also voice in the Council , and we be attempt to reconcile these concern with the task that fall to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense . </s>
when it come to acceptance by the Council , I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendment adopt by Parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposal . </s>
I be absolutely convince that it will be easy for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis . </s>
turn now to the most important of our propose amendment , one of the essential difference be that , in place of a &quot; service provision card plus notification for each individual contract &quot; system , provision be no longer make for be able to request the previous notification from the receive state for each individual contract . </s>
this system appear to us to be unsuitable in practical term . </s>
however , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacle must be remove before the service provision card be issue , and as the Commission 's proposal would have it , more stringent condition must be satisfy before a service provision card be issue . </s>
an individual be require to be in authorise employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three month thereafter . </s>
this should serve as a guarantee for the receive state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the send state once the contract be complete and that they will be cover under insurance law in the event of illness or accident . </s>
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence right should be clarify before the service provision card be issue , namely under the term of an opposition procedure . </s>
What we be propose be that it should not just be a case of have to apply for the Eu service provision card for all Member States , rather one should also have the option of apply for it for individual Member States . </s>
I believe this system be also more suit to practical need . </s>
I would hope that the same hold true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first post to three month , and to be flexible in adapt the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first post . </s>
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be @card@ month . </s>
when it come to self-employed person , in addition to the amendment already describe , we propose that the domicile criterion should be make more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of counter any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment . </s>
I would also just like to go into those of the propose amendment that go beyond the propose amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . </s>
of course I would add that I continue to support this committee 's amendment , which they adopt unanimously . </s>
I have even submit four amendment on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quote Council decision . </s>
I must say I have receive extremely contradictory statement from Parliament 's service as to exactly how these Council decision should be quote ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them . </s>
Two amendment be cancel by the service because the content have supposedly already be give consideration to in the report . </s>
I withdraw the two other amendment - that be Amendment no @card@ to the report on self-employed person and Amendment no @card@ on employ person . </s>
I can only urge the conference of president to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matter of comitology , I. E. the correct way to quote . </s>
this would make our rapporteur 's life considerably easy in the future . </s>
There be also a propose amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio 's report . </s>
unfortunately I have to say that I be unable to support this propose amendment because it in fact change the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market resolve on unanimously , and I would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrive at together after lengthy discussion . </s>
on a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who support me in compile these report , which be far from easy to produce . </s>
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention , for he have the dubious honour of be the shadow rapporteur and be involve to a far great extent than be customary in the draw up of this report , contribute excellent and constructive idea ; and this without be in a position to receive the plaudit award a rapporteur . </s>
that be why he deserve special mention ! </s>
. </s>
( NL ) Mr President , I be pleased I have be give the opportunity to make a few introductory remark at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger 's speech , after which I will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speaker . </s>
if you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendment in more detail at the end of the debate . </s>
May I say how the Commission welcome the European Parliament 's support for the two proposal on the freedom to provide service and on third-country employee , the topic of the debate . </s>
I be extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger have put into these proposal which be politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge . </s>
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . </s>
the Commission particularly welcome the suggestion make by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision card . </s>
if the opportunity be create to apply for service provision card for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still . </s>
the Commission also support the propose flexible period of validity of the card . </s>
however , I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee be resident in a Member State . </s>
the Commission also agree with a provision for case in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer be terminate at short notice . </s>
an efficient procedure for issue card imply that company which provide cross-border service can also exercise their right in concrete term on the basis of the internal market . </s>
it seem over the top to us for other Member States to be give the option of systematically carry out inspection systematically with a view to safeguard public order before they issue card . </s>
indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who have legal status in a Member State to be admit to other Member States too . </s>
that do not prevent these Member States from take public-order measure within the framework of the propose duty of notification . </s>
neither do the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three month after the card have expire . </s>
follow completion of the service , it be not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service be provide . </s>
that be why the Commission support Mrs Palacio 's Amendment No @card@ in both respect . </s>
as far as the second proposal be concern , the Commission appreciate the wish that it should be clear what be mean by someone who be self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amend proposal . </s>
these be a few introductory remark concern the key amendment . </s>
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speaker have contribute , I will once again be give the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendment . </s>
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amend version . </s>
I propose to confine my comment to two area . </s>
firstly there be the question as to what this directive be actually design to achieve , that be achieve in the real sense . </s>
There be the fact that we have to take the interest of the economy and also of the individual into account . </s>
my comment start from the premise that we be talk about an upright individual in gainful employment . </s>
then there be the interest of the Member States , which , be on the receive end , may have to start from the premise of a bad case scenario . </s>
if we be go to abide by the one extreme , that be the interest of the Member States , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdle that have to be clear in apply for this card relatively high . </s>
There be also an argument for introduce early notification obligation as well as have this card . </s>
if I be to go to the other extreme , as few hurdle as possible that be , then I would run the risk of fail to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive . </s>
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdle face the business world be so high , in reality no one would apply for the card . </s>
alternatively , I might have no directive at all . </s>
neither outcome would be satisfactory . </s>
perhaps this be also why , as be rumour to be the case , the Council have become bog down in its negotiation on this as well . </s>
we have be try to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of find the easy possible solution . </s>
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdle be create vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have be overcome , implementation be as easy as it possibly could be . </s>
therefore we want application for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States . </s>
if a company in France say that it have an employee who have to work in Denmark on a permanent basis , and only in Denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark . </s>
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdle that have to be overcome would be low in this instance . </s>
in return for this , however , we want early notification obligation to be discontinue , rather it should just be a matter of the employee take the justification for the post to the other Member State along with them , and this might take the form of the contract form the basis for his / her post . </s>
consequently , I too have to say that I be in favour of the amendment put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . </s>
perhaps there be a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission . </s>
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution . </s>
if a particular Member State be to declare that it have suddenly run into problem because the individual concern have commit a theft and the card be for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card , as it be , for the reason cite in this directive , which be altogether a flexible and intelligent solution . </s>
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter . </s>
most of those who have be work on the directive to date have be lawyer . </s>
we all know that there be still various part of the Treaty , some of them very old , which be still refer to as EC . </s>
we be aware that this directive be found on EC law and not on Eu law . </s>
however , before the election we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , union and company that be - work towards make the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizen . </s>
we have expect the citizen to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to Eu . </s>
they have now get to grip with &quot; Eu &quot; . </s>
we would be do neither ourselves nor the citizen any favours if we be to christen the product we be propose to deliver &quot; EC service provision card &quot; and not &quot; Eu service provision card &quot; . </s>
it be the world of the Eu that the citizen be interested in , this be the one that count in their eye . </s>
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction . </s>
Mr President it be later than any of us think it would be when we be plan for this session so I shall be very brief indeed . </s>
One of the reason why we be late be because we spend time earlier today rightly state the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism . </s>
this directive be , of course , not in itself directly about that . </s>
it be about attend to the need of the internal market , create flexibility and behave in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country person both as employee and self-employed . </s>
that be in itself also about avoid being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she be a stranger . </s>
we welcome that , and because we think it make a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carry out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market generally , which have incorporate innovative idea into this directive , which I hope will be approve by the Commission and the Council . </s>
nevertheless , I have table an amendment . </s>
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security . </s>
the first point on which we disagree be the duration of three month for the residency permit , since all that do be create legal insecurity . </s>
you rightly raise the concern , also express by Mr Wieland , at the possibility of worker disappear into thin air when their work permit expire , but I think that we would be make this even more likely by bring in a three month permit . </s>
if the validity of the service provision card expire on a certain date , it must end on that date . </s>
legal security require this . </s>
on the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No @card@ , which refer to the first directive , you suggest that , for reason of public security or public order regulation , a Member State may reject the validity of the card . </s>
There be already some ex ante control lay down in article 4 of the directive . </s>
it make no sense for any worker within the Schengen area , since he or she will already have undergo a screening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be justify in reject ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory . </s>
it therefore make no sense to maintain that legal insecurity . </s>
in the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No @card@ , that possibility be contemplate , and be perfectly express , and I believe this provide great legal security . </s>
the discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No @card@ , seem to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report . </s>
I would therefore ask member to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result . </s>
on the face of it these two proposal appear to be implement certain procedural change to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court case Mrs Berger refer to in her opening remark . </s>
however , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which be unacceptable . </s>
partly this be substance and partly it be in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom . </s>
under the arrangement contain in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retain its border control . </s>
under the system propose in these piece of legislation , third country national wish to move to the UK under the procedure describe , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issue by another Member State , thereby by-pass UK border control . </s>
if there be to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangement , that change should be make by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process . </s>
for that reason , we shall vote against both these proposal . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , first and foremost I would like to extend warm thank to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the effort they have expend in sum up the various propose amendment and interest in this report in such a balanced manner . </s>
these two proposal contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principle of the internal market for the freedom to provide service . </s>
the new regulation for cross-border service will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprise . </s>
the strict basic condition attach to the issue of the Eu service provision card - and I be with Mr Wieland on this - be essential , for they will serve to prevent abuse such as illegal entry and bogus contract . </s>
why do I think we need the directive so much ? </s>
Three reason and they be as follow : on account of the economic importance of third-country worker in the Eu , in the interest of the competitiveness of enterprise and the proper functioning of the internal market . </s>
therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic condition , I would also call for the control that be to be implement by the Member States to be make as effective and simple as possible . </s>
my last question relate to something people constantly approach me about and be therefore address to the Commission . </s>
Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiation ? </s>
How be Article 1 to be interpret and explain in your view , as this will have important implication , notably for the accession negotiation and for our country , which share common border with so many applicant country ? </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , businesspeople have so far have to live with the fact that two of the key freedom , namely the free movement of people and service , do not apply to them . </s>
indeed , they be still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedure of the Member States where a service have to be provide . </s>
There be approximately thirteen million third-country subject who reside within European territory . </s>
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople include in this figure be not know , their number will most definitely not be low . </s>
so , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union have not be regulate by Community legislation . </s>
the aim of the two present proposal for a directive be to promote the free movement of service within the internal market by mean of introduce the Eu service provision card . </s>
it seem important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issue in a flexible manner , namely within five day of a simple declaration be have be submit to a Member State where the service will be provide ; and that , also to prevent misuse , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extend . </s>
I have also pay close attention to the concern raise by the Commissioner . </s>
have also study the amendment submit , I conclude that we can go along with these concern to a large extent and that this will be reflect in our voting behaviour tomorrow . </s>
May I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she have take in study the different amendment and for have , in that way , add an important degree of mean to her report ? </s>
I think that , with this report , we be , once again , one step close to the realisation of the internal market . </s>
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you be give me to go into the different amendment in more detail . </s>
in the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regard the remark he have just make . </s>
regard the first proposal on third-country employee , the Commission be prepare to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
amendment Nos 7 and 8 be acceptable too , provide the situation of post be establish in the Member State in which the service provider be establish . </s>
the Commission also agree with Amendment No @card@ , except for the propose period of previous employment of only three month , as I explain just now . </s>
we also welcome Amendment no @card@ insofar as , as a result of this , the card 's area of applicability be extend from one Member State to all Member States . </s>
in term of comitology , Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ also apply in part , insofar as the right of Parliament be concern . </s>
I regret that the Commission have find Amendment no @card@ to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service be provide be concern . </s>
in this respect , the Commission support Amendment No @card@ , as I have already mention . </s>
the other amendment be unacceptable . </s>
personally , I be rather in favour of the term &quot; Eu service provision card &quot; which be propose in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam do not allow this . </s>
as Amendment no @card@ refer to Directive @card@ / @card@ concern the minimum wage which be already in force , no change be necessary . </s>
Acceptance of Amendment No @card@ by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card be issue . </s>
surely this be contrary to interest of public order within the Member States . </s>
Amendment No @card@ be also unacceptable , give my thought on Amendment No @card@ . </s>
the Commission have the same opinion of similar amendment to the second proposal . </s>
I would like to add that Amendment no @card@ to that proposal be wholly acceptable . </s>
as far as Amendment No @card@ on the definition of the term &quot; self-employed &quot; be concern , the Commission will , as I have already remark , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objection lodge . </s>
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood 's remark . </s>
he refer to United Kingdom border control and I would like to say to him that Member States , and this include the United Kingdom , be under no obligation at all to abolish or change control at the existing border . </s>
this apply , as already state , to the United Kingdom and it also apply to Belgium , where it be recently of relevance . </s>
with regard to the remark make by Mr Karas , I be under the impression that he be talk about the possibility of people from Poland be use as employee in his country . </s>
the Commission would like to propose find a solution to this problem which would then apply to all company base in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU country . </s>
the question be , furthermore , one of whether the two case should be treat in the same way . </s>
in my opinion , this be an issue which belong to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate . </s>
on behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point . </s>
I will keep myself free in this connection . </s>
finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspect of these proposal and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ a. M. Court of First Instance the next item be the report ( A5 ­ @card@ / @card@ ) by Mr Marinho , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on : I. Proposal for a Council decision amend Decision @card@ / @card@ / ECSC , EEC , Euratom , establish a Court of First Instance of the European community ( @card@ / @card@ - C5-0020 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) , and II . </s>
proposal for a Council decision amend Decision @card@ / @card@ / ECSC , EEC , Euratom , establish a Court of First Instance of the European community ( @card@ / @card@ - C5-0167 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) . </s>
Mr President , there be no guarantee that the forthcoming revision of the treaty at the IGC will clear the way for a revision of the Community 's judicial system . </s>
the idea of include this issue on the agenda we be discuss today be still on the agenda of the Helsinki Summit , be still be advocate by various Member States and by the court themselves , and be be keep alive in the European Parliament , whose Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market be prepare what I think will be a high-quality opinion on the nature and the extent of judicial reform . </s>
I have no doubt that Parliament 's next report on preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference will address this issue rigorously , for three reason which be , to my mind , interlink . </s>
these be that justice must be do more quickly , that we need to establish the legal base for an area of freedom , security and justice , and , finally , that we need to move beyond a commercial and economic conception of Europe . </s>
this will convince the public that they be part of a legal community which be base on democratic law and on the court , and which respect their fundamental ethical and legal value and protect their interest , even when the force of national law be not sufficient to guarantee them full citizenship . </s>
the truth be that these fundamental reason for a thorough reform of the entire Community judicial system also explain the possible reform of the Court of First Instance which we be discuss today , although that have a different legal basis , namely the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
these reason do , however , justify such a reform , particularly two or three of them , which I shall now mention . </s>
the first be the imbalance between the increase volume of case , the technical and human capacity of the court in Luxembourg and the strict obligation to adhere to multilingual proceeding , which be the natural consequence of respect for each country 's language and legal tradition . </s>
the last reason be that this court , the Court of First Instance , be the only instance to which individual and company have recourse on economic dispute with regard to decision by the body which affect them . </s>
therefore , the propose increase to @card@ judge be fully justify because , ultimately , it be a matter of increase the Court 's efficiency and it will enable two additional chamber to be establish , in each of which three judge will sit . </s>
the second reform propose concern an increase in the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance , which , at present , only cover action for annulment by private individual but which will then also cover action bring by Member States . </s>
I be talk here about potential action by the Member States concern transport policy , competition rule applicable to undertaking , state aid , trade protection measure , the application of fund , and other action programme under which the Community grant financial assistance , particularly concern proceeding relate to fraud against the Community budget . </s>
when Member States accept the possibility of an appeal to the Court of First Instance involve proceeding on the same matter as an action already bring by a private individual , the Court will be able to establish what appeal a Member State have lodge . </s>
this will put Member States and private individual on an equal footing in the way the Court function . </s>
Mr President , some people will call this a lightweight reform , but the fact be that it be an achievable reform , base on standard which make it permissible under the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
it be basically the reform envisage and request by the Court of the European community itself independently of the IGC and on the basis of the Treaty currently in force . </s>
I believe , particularly because there be such considerable consensus within the committee , that Parliament will agree to these two proposal and that it will give the Court its vote . </s>
we can only hope that the Council will do the same . </s>
my last hope be that the Court will make the well possible use of its new power , the new jurisdiction which this Parliament have , not a moment too soon , decide to grant it . </s>
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulate the rapporteur on a report , which , on read it , give the impression of simply confirm and accept the Council 's draft decision . </s>
however , this report be base on long and effective work which have already produce certain result , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency 's document of 7 December @card@ of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competence of the Community Courts . </s>
for this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carry out by Vice-President Marinho . </s>
Mr President , the reform of the Community judicial system have become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be do within reasonable time scale , and if , in the future , the European Union wish to have a judicial system which be equal to the political project which we have embark upon . </s>
today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament have have a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project be much more than just an internal market , and that it be base much more on principle than on economic interest . </s>
behind these principle , Mr President , lie the justice system . </s>
however , justice delay be justice deny , and we must reflect on this notion . </s>
the work document prepare by the Court itself contain alarming information . </s>
for this reason , the draft reform , which have be draw up by the rapporteur , Vice-President Marinho , be to be welcome . </s>
it be true that it be a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solution because , at the moment - as he himself have point out - we can expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
we have to offer solution which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice . </s>
I would like to make two observation during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , give this Parliament 's obligation , in accordance with the Treaty , to produce a very succinct report , which do not go into depth . </s>
these be two of Vice-President Marinho 's idea and , I believe , they be second by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . </s>
the first be that great resource should be give to judge of first instance , and that they should be give one more référendaire . </s>
the second be that the translation service of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separate . </s>
at the moment , the Court of First Instance have to wait a very long time for its judgement to be translate . </s>
accord to the Treaty , one of the founding principle of this Community be linguistic and cultural plurality and there be no question of our overlook the possibility of something as important as be able to read a judgement in our own language . </s>
since we be talk about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two point . </s>
the first concern this Parliament . </s>
I believe that it be well worth insist that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judge . </s>
above all , we wish to see an extension of the competence of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligation , in other word , its resource . </s>
we wish to see its competence extend , especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible option , certain clear limitation of protection in these area which be of extraordinary importance to our citizen . </s>
and I refer once again to the declaration which we have hear in recent day . </s>
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the content of this report . </s>
it have cause me to reflect on two problem which have come to me recently in my own constituency . </s>
both concern case with decision pend before the Court of Justice . </s>
the first relate to a large suspension bridge and whether or not toll on it should be subject to VAT . </s>
the decision could have huge implication for our local economy . </s>
secondly there be a lady within thirteen week of retirement who be desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstance in old age . </s>
these be just two example of real life problem behind delay in Europe 's system of justice . </s>
delay in justice can mean personal difficulty and even tragedy . </s>
this be not to say that all of our own national system of justice be perfect , but all too often they may be wait for a preliminary ruling from the European Court . </s>
amongst the statistic there be a worrying upward trend in the time take to deal with preliminary reference . </s>
this should not be take as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court 's structure and its lack of resource in a grow European Union . </s>
the proposal in this report be very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe be a legal construction , its court be central to its proper functioning . </s>
in the face of come enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system . </s>
otherwise we will all , as elect representative , be face with more and more clamour from our citizen who be not get access to quick and effective justice . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report . </s>
I also fully endorse his finding , in which , in particular , he suggest increase the number of consultant for judge at the Court of First Instance and provide the latter with its own translation service . </s>
in point of fact , I consider this to be necessary because we hear , follow the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market 's visit to Luxembourg , that it be of course inevitable , a god-given fact as it be , that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it come to use the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important case handle by the Court of First Instance can be give the attention they deserve . </s>
however I also believe that the reform must go further than those we be to adopt here . </s>
for example , I believe it be worth consider make the Court of First Instance that of last instance , if applicable , and make this a final competence , in those sphere where bench of the Court , which resemble court , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plan be for European civil service law . </s>
I be also aware that we be probably also go to have to do something about the European Commission 's inclination to renationalise competition decision and transfer them back to national level . </s>
it seem to me that we need to give this some think , as these case will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decision . </s>
we need to consider how we will deal with situation of this kind . </s>
where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decision in competition case to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance . </s>
in addition , we must consider whether it be right and proper - and we have already have case in which MEPs , not to mention group , lodge a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such case , when in fact matter of a constitutional nature be affect and it make more sense for such matter to be bring before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance . </s>
on a final note , I too believe that Olaf require monitoring under rule of law . </s>
as thing stand , Olaf be in a vacuum and can do as it please . </s>
it be essential for Olaf to be monitor by a court . </s>
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance . </s>
that would be another way of spur the reform process on . </s>
Mr President , I would like to begin by join those who congratulate the rapporteur on this work . </s>
the European Union be a system base on law . </s>
it must therefore have a system of court to enforce that law . </s>
furthermore , if the court can deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload place on them , what happen , as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi have already point out , be that justice delayed become , as we know , justice deny . </s>
the evidence of the court be that that be happen now and it point to step which can be take now to alleviate the problem . </s>
however , as Mr Marinho have point out , more be necessary , but that have to wait for the IGC , in my own country , mythology tell of the teem horde of faceless Brussels bureaucrat but it never mention the number of European judge . </s>
There be less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload give the responsibility of their task at the heart of the European legal system . </s>
the extent of their importance can be see in the political implication of the delay in resolve the outstanding Anglo / French dispute over British beef which have cause such anger in my country and such frustration with the working of the Union 's dispute resolution procedure . </s>
this have be compound , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French court which make it well nigh impossible for non-French national to proceed against the French government . </s>
certainly it be perceive de facto to be impossible . </s>
this contrast most unfavourably with the United Kingdom court where Spanish fisherman successfully bring an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstance which be very comparable . </s>
What be happen in France , Mr President , appear prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other Eu national on ground of nationality and as such to be in breach of the treaty . </s>
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who be kind enough to make some comment about my remark in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their finding . </s>
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remark that he will do this . </s>
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond as follow . </s>
the Commission have take note of the position adopt today by the European Parliament regard the request make by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance . </s>
the purport of this request be , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeal to the Court of First Instance , such appeal currently be within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judge at the Court of First Instance . </s>
May I add that , on behalf of the Commission , I listen with great interest to the plea which have be make just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlie these plea . </s>
the unease be justify . </s>
it have be say more than once : justice delay be justice deny . </s>
the Commission sympathise with these consideration . </s>
in the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follow . </s>
as your Parliament be aware , the Commission be convince that , without fundamental reform , the Community judicial body run the risk - in the short term - of no longer be able to carry out their task within reasonable deadline . </s>
consequently , the Commission have ask for the advice of a group of expert regard the entirety of the reform which could be implement in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decade . </s>
the Commission be aware of the request make by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judge , but at the moment , the former be of the opinion that the propose transfer of competence should be see in the light of the study which I have just mention . </s>
in other word , once this study be complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ a. m. tomorrow . </s>
exceptional financial aid to Kosovo the next item be the report ( A5-0022 / @card@ ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council decision provide exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0045 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) . </s>
I have be inform that the rapporteur have be delay for several minute . </s>
I propose that we start the debate immediately . </s>
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrive . </s>
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . </s>
Mr President , this be an important and urgent matter , and Parliament be comply with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , man and woman be die in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature be @card@ degree below zero , these people be do a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not be pay . </s>
an urgent request have be refer to us , and we approve it . </s>
we have be ask for EUR @card@ million . </s>
we agree that it may be grant and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensure , once the decision have be take , that the amount be set aside and pay as quickly as possible . </s>
we be talk about macrofinancial aid . </s>
There be reaction to this in some quarter since it do not comply with the liberal canon of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration . </s>
this be not our opinion . </s>
our opinion be that it be vital to contribute to set up an administration in Kosovo and that it be by no mean absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employee in this region . </s>
indeed that be something extremely useful that we could have do in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state . </s>
the second important problem be that we have be ask for payment , the donor have make commitment and , obviously , we be the only one actually pay . </s>
the other party be not pay . </s>
we wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regard request for financial aid . </s>
we would like the Commission to make commitment on the amendment we be propose in regard to this . </s>
we would like to link the grant of all aid to the availability of the amount due from the other donor . </s>
this be not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution be be match by the contribution of other donor . </s>
from that point of view , the propose facility be a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be release as soon as the donor have make clear their interest . </s>
finally , we have three question for the Commission in this regard . </s>
firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amount that other donor contribute . </s>
when we come to pay , we want to know what the other be pay . </s>
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitation to tender and the schedule for their implementation . </s>
during the budgetary procedure we be tell that the fund for Kosovo must be vote on as a matter of urgency yet , accord to our information , no invitation to tender have be publish or initiate to date . </s>
this be serious , since it hold up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo . </s>
finally , and this follow on from what I have just say , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regard progress on payment make . </s>
we have commission document which speak of firm commitment . </s>
it be not firm commitment that we need , just plain commitment would suffice , and we need to know what have actually be pay and , more especially , what have not be pay . </s>
Kosovo have suffer far too much from delay in payment . </s>
Mr President , if we be go to discuss Kosovo today , as we have do many time before , then we should also start by take stock of what have actually already be do in Kosovo , or of whether in fact anything have be do at all . </s>
What I mean to say be that a few small step have already be make along the path to normality , and it would be nice if they could at least be list in the course of such a debate . </s>
as of 9 February , there will be something know as the Kosovo Transitional Council , which will comprise representative of the political party , the minority and civil society , and which be intend to be a quasi interim parliament . </s>
this be a positive move and we welcome it , but I believe we need to equip the individual concern with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they be actually go to have to prepare , for election be plan for the autumn . </s>
no one really know what these election be to lead to and what kind of parliament be to be form as a result . </s>
no one know what kind of authority this parliament be go to have vis-à-vis UNMIK . </s>
in other word , there be quite a few imponderable that we be not be inform about and that other be presumably unable to get to grip with properly either . </s>
of all people , it be the Albanian , who be now be integrate into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what be in store for them . </s>
in addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be give to restore the coexistence of Serbs , Albanian and other minority - not forget the Roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place . </s>
I would like to list again the thing that have actually already be accomplish and that we can be please about . </s>
Administration-wise there be now @card@ tax inspector . </s>
that be excellent news ! </s>
There too , people be be encourage to pay their taxis , for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handout from the Eu and from other donor ; some of the money for these activity must come from their own resource . </s>
it should also be note that of the @card@ department , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represent an improvement on the situation there hitherto . </s>
There be something else that we be keen to develop and this be very important for a state under the rule of law . </s>
we have @card@ judge and public prosecutor , who have now be swear in , and who be ready to take up their work of dispense justice , with a view to enrich the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least be able to track criminal down and then secure conviction . </s>
another positive development I would like to remind you of be the fact that the old UCK be now bind up in the reconstruction of the country . </s>
I believe that be a good thing I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets have to say on financing and believe that we should remind the commission that it really must press other donor to at long last pay their way . </s>
the Eu Commission can pay for everything . </s>
it be responsible for reconstruction down there and for the fourth Pillar , but it can constantly be call upon to pay Mr Kouchner 's outstanding bill . </s>
one could do so once or twice , but I feel that the UN donor should contribute to this as well , for there be a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we be unable to fill . </s>
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judge accord to how we fulfil it . </s>
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanation . </s>
in a debate , there be always the danger that we will repeat much of what have already be say . </s>
however , I would like to concentrate on two point . </s>
firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union be the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo . </s>
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press be true , and that figure do not lie . </s>
let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it . </s>
the Union have decide to assist with a further EUR @card@ million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , on the basis of an IMF report which estimate that a further EUR @card@ million be need for that reconstruction . </s>
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I be in complete agreement with her when she say that the Commission should insist that other contributor fulfil their commitment . </s>
I would also like to express my concern - which be very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that say that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter , in any circumstance , the financial perspective agree in Berlin . </s>
this call into question the agreement which Parliament reach , with great difficulty , with the Council in December , accord to which , when the Commission present a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspective would be review where necessary . </s>
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which be really very difficult to reach . </s>
I would like to ask the Commission - and I be glad that Commissioner Solbes be here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , request by Parliament , so that it may be take into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget be draw up , as we have be promise . </s>
lastly , I would like to insist that , although we have agree to EUR @card@ million now , we know that this be a stopgap solution and that it be not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo , which be so badly need . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue be still on the agenda today , more be the pity . </s>
the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR @card@ million , and this piece of advice be give because this money can truly benefit those in need . </s>
the thing that have give us cause for criticism be not so serious as to stop us want to help the people there . </s>
however , this do not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process . </s>
of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration have not forget to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official document . </s>
only then would we have be able to conduct proper and search discussion . </s>
I urge the administration to see to it that this do not happen in future . </s>
it be only because there be people in need that we be prepare to overlook this . </s>
however , we must be sure to introduce certain condition here . </s>
One condition be that money should be give to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursue other aim . </s>
in other word , we should ensure that the money fall to Mr Kouchner 's sphere of competence and not to other sphere . </s>
secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problem there , we believe that the other donor must also fulfil the obligation they have enter into . </s>
this mission be be conduct under the auspice of the United Nations and we can have a situation where the European Union be the only one to fulfil its obligation . </s>
it be no less incumbent on the other donor country to fulfil their obligation within this timeframe , in the interest of the person affect . </s>
this bring me onto the point that in future we be go to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general term , that be to say , not just with this specific project but with overall development in south-east Europe , and with the aid deliver there . </s>
this be another example of the fact that the European Union be prepare to help and to give money but the political leadership lack coherence . </s>
we have so many coordinator , who , in turn , be responsible to so many employer , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinator . </s>
perhaps it would be good , however , if the position of responsibility within the European Union and the other institution from the OSCE to the United Nations , be to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinate procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there . </s>
I know that the Commission be think seriously about how to achieve this , but if the European Union be do the most work out there , then it should also be give the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people . </s>
it make no sense at all for the various international institution and association to be engage in competition amongst themselves rather than invest all their energy in help the people on the ground ! </s>
bear in mind that the conference of donor for the stability pact be constantly be postpone - it be now set for the end of March - that no one know which project be actually in the pipeline , that one can tell how thing can actually be implement , and there be a steady stream of new press conference , this do not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst people to this region of Europe ! </s>
accordingly , we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative , so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and have to restore our solvency at the end of a month . </s>
rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country , and I hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligation at long last and not allow thing to continue as they have be do for the past few month . </s>
Mr President , when the Alliance intervene in Kosovo its objective be to re-establish condition in this province which would enable those who wish to do so to stay there or return , with respect for their own heritage and their own culture . </s>
if the Alliance be still active in that region , it be with the same objective . </s>
the day before yesterday I be please to hear an interview give by the KFOR commander showing how much good matter in connection with this in Kosovo be start to be , particularly as regard security , crime level have be restore to an acceptable level . </s>
those represent Europe who be active at the grass root level in pursue this objective , and I be think in particular of the special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , be on the verge of despondency precisely because , since matter be improve , there be less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which be needed there be become less apparent . </s>
we must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of shopkeeper follow the rule of the warlord . </s>
it be true that economic aid be , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afford those people active at the grass root level . </s>
let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack have just make and stress that we , the member of the European Parliament , must fulfil our own obligation in this regard , while ensure , of course , that we be not the only one to do so . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , firstly I would like to extend warm thank to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report . </s>
if the Council have work as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on . </s>
the Council 's failing in this respect be a source of much regret . </s>
the rapporteur and the report be right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it be also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random . </s>
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment no 5 at this point , which clearly emphasise that it be only possible , and permissible , to use the fund from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirement arise from public or semi-public , communal and other authority and institution , which be control either directly or indirectly by UNMIK . </s>
commissioner , it must be make clear that we support UNMIK and the institution set up by the United Nations , in particular Pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structure that have form in Kosovo and be still in place . </s>
What be to be do with this money ? </s>
I would like to highlight the issue of human right . </s>
the West fight for human right in Kosovo and what be happen there today ? </s>
we be able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carry out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable thing happen : people be kill , people be prevent from live there or be prevent from live their life as they see fit . </s>
every single day there be attack on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attack be also still carry out on Albanian . </s>
I be in fact shock to read in the report , assume this be true , how an Albanian doctor , who be work in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have be great difficulty , ultimately have to give up help his kinsman in this hospital because there be constant threat on his life . </s>
these be event and situation that can be tolerate . </s>
I hear - whether it be true or not I do not know - that the Serbs be even continue to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo . </s>
There be , at the very least , rumour that Serbian militia be up to their old trick again . </s>
it be irrelevant , as far as I be concern , as to whether it be Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanian who be threaten or kill in Kosovo . </s>
it be also irrelevant , in my view , as to who be work towards separation and division in Kosovo . </s>
What be all-important , to my mind , be that the body we be financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-ethnic Kosovo that be , a Kosovo where people can live together . </s>
we need more police officer , as we have nowhere near enough . </s>
we need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need fund for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights . </s>
all of this need to happen , and quickly too . </s>
if we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflict and crisis situation may arise . </s>
that be why I believe that we be right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make fund available . </s>
only , now we want to see this translate into deed and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these fund be put to good use , notably for build up the police force and for establish the judiciary . </s>
. </s>
( ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the member , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have deal with this issue . </s>
this will no doubt allow us to release the fund for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concern which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mention . </s>
I think I have see three type of fundamental concern in tonight 's debate . </s>
firstly , although much progress have be make , and we could mention custom administration , bank administration or tax administration , it be true that we must continue to move forward . </s>
however , in move forward , what should we be finance ? </s>
this be the first point on which there be a certain amount of disagreement . </s>
in some of your amendment you propose that we limit further the type of body which can be provide with Union fund , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 . </s>
in our view , however , in both respect , great room for manoeuvre should be leave to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , be more aware of the reality than we be . </s>
we believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resource should be direct , would create more practical difficulty . </s>
in short , we should put our faith in those party who , in these area , be well equip than us to make certain decision . </s>
the second concern which I notice that many of you share - it be first express by Mr Bourlanges , but other have repeat it - refer to the situation regard the other donor . </s>
be the Commission make an excessive effort while other be fail to cooperate ? </s>
some of the amendment in your report pose this question . </s>
for example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 . </s>
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raise this issue , that this be not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally . </s>
the fundamental problem be that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donor have be establish in the statement of the High Level Steering Group , but it be also true that they have no legal status . </s>
this be simply a political commitment . </s>
that be the reason why , while accept its spirit , we would ask that Amendment no 1 be word differently - and we have send a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it do not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resource . </s>
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seem to us to be basically correct . </s>
Amendment No 4 be of a similar nature . </s>
on this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges great satisfaction . </s>
we have already speak to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establish this element of conditionality . </s>
with regard to the second contribution , what we propose be that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decide in accordance with the external financial need of Kosovo and the contribution of other bilateral donor . </s>
in other word , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it be more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage . </s>
in this way , we would have no problem in act immediately . </s>
we would not create problem for the Kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donor to make their financial contribution in the way that we be do . </s>
a third problem have be raise by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programme . </s>
I would remind you that these project be multiannual . </s>
the programme clearly have to take the annual budgetary contribution into account . </s>
lastly , I would like to make some observation on the request for additional information which have be address to us . </s>
on the one hand , we have be ask to provide Parliament with information regard the progress of invitation to tender and , in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission be last week able to provide Parliament 's Committee on Budgets with the late statement of contract and payment carry out since the task force be send into action in Kosovo . </s>
the Commission can commit itself to regularly inform Parliament of the invitation to tender which be publish . </s>
we also wish to see these publicise on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point . </s>
a second point which I would like to comment on be the remain information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance . </s>
in this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission be prepare to keep the chairman of the various committee involve in this area regularly inform , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provide require confidentiality , on the different scheme be implement for macroeconomic assistance . </s>
thank you very much , lady and gentleman , and I hope that , with the final decision of the Council , we can release these fund and make a positive contribution to maintain the considerable effort be make in Kosovo by different party , so that we might achieve that situation of great coexistence and peace which we all wish to see . </s>
Mr President , I be please to see the convergence of viewpoint there be between Parliament , particularly the Committee on Budgets , and the Commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duty . </s>
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitment make by their service in the Committee on Budgets . </s>
There be a clear agreement , good or bad I will not say , but there be a contract . </s>
There be a clear understanding between the Commission service and the Committee on Budgets that there be agreement on Amendments 4 and 7 , i. e. on the idea of link the mobilisation , the implementation , of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donor should first have fulfill their relative obligation in term of payment . </s>
but , if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira say correctly , then this undertaking be only a tentative one . </s>
Commissioner , an agreement be an agreement . </s>
Can you confirm the agreement make by your service in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ? </s>
or be you go to drop this proviso , thus break the undertaking make to us ? </s>
no , Mr Bourlanges , I think it be a substantive problem . </s>
the problem be how in practical term to implement the compromise which we accept . </s>
What I propose to you , and what I still say , be that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this : the exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decide in due course take into account development in Kosovo 's external financing need and contribution from other bilateral donor . </s>
with this , we believe that we be totally in line with what we agree . </s>
I be simply ask the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implement the second tranche . </s>
I agree , absolutely . </s>
we shall do so . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ a. m. tomorrow . </s>
ALTENER the next item be the report ( A5-0011 / @card@ ) by Mr Langen , on the joint text approve by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopt a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy source in the Community - Altener ( C5-0333 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he be not actually here - for the work he have do to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council . </s>
the project have be long and problematic . </s>
in future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy source . </s>
although there be much that be good about the new directive , it be nonetheless not without its defect . </s>
One example be the use of peat . </s>
Peat can be classify as belong in the same group as fossil fuel . </s>
if peat can be classify directly as a renewable , non-fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation be concern . </s>
it be not right that peat should be judge accord to the same criterion as , for example , coal . </s>
the development of renewable energy source be a partial solution to end the Union 's dependence on import energy . </s>
Research be particularly essential with regard also to the Eu 's next round of enlargement . </s>
dependence on import energy affect bad of all many eastern European country , whose economic structure be still suffer from the dependence create in the time of the Soviet union on Russian energy . </s>
the Eu must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate . </s>
we be all concern about the environment and our child 's future . </s>
the share that renewable energy source have in total energy production must be increase , but it have to be do in a rational manner . </s>
we have to remember that our basic energy production can be base on renewables for a long time to come . </s>
for that we need a form of energy production that do not harm the climate : nuclear energy . </s>
Mr President , forgive me for arrive a little late but in fact the programme move on a little faster than anticipate . </s>
I would like to thank Mrs Matikainen-Kallström for stand in . </s>
she have already say something about the Altener and save programme . </s>
we now find ourselves in the final stage of a conciliation process on measure in the energy sector for the period @card@ , with Altener relate to the important sector of renewable energy . </s>
this be intend to create the necessary precondition for implement an action plan in this sector and , in particular , for offer additional incentive to invest private or public money in the production and usage of renewable energy . </s>
since the current programme finish at the end of last year and the Council do not accept the amendment adopt by Parliament , the conciliation procedure have to come into play . </s>
it be quite amazing as to how doggedly the Member States in the Council try to fight this programme for alternative energy and an appropriate level of funding . </s>
however I have to say the Finnish President-in-Office of the Council have relatively little power to act as long as the Member States block the necessary increase in this funding . </s>
the original financial package of EUR @card@ million , as propose by the Commission , be reduce by the Council to EUR @card@ million , unilaterally and without explanation . </s>
it be therefore only logical that Parliament should demand the reinstatement of the original financial package . </s>
in addition to the funding for the programme , there be a few other point that the Council and Parliament be in dispute over . </s>
it be possible , in the course of the conciliation procedure , to reach agreement with the Council on those of our essential demand , one being to examine the possibility of open the Altener programme to the associated Mediterranean country when this programme next undergo revision . </s>
we be assure that the Council will publish a statement on this in the Official Journal . </s>
as far as the financial framework be concern , have the Council significantly reduce its original package it would have come close to jeopardise the continued existence of the programme . </s>
the parliamentary delegation in the Conciliation Committee be concern to secure the continued existence of the content of a worthwhile programme . </s>
hence we agree to the compromise in the end , even though we be not completely satisfy with it . </s>
we accept that the funding should be raise to EUR @card@ million . </s>
that be an acceptable , albeit not entirely satisfactory outcome . </s>
we opt for this compromise so as not to jeopardise the continued existence of this programme . </s>
however it would appear that unless there be increase effort on the part of the Member States , it will not be possible to achieve the goal of produce @card@ % of the overall primary energy demand from renewable energy source by the year @card@ . </s>
accordingly , we have secure the continuation of an Eu programme that be important in term of environmental and economic policy and that be instrumental in limit CO2 emission , increase the proportion of renewable energy in the overall energy balance , reduce dependence on energy import , provide security of supply and ensure cohesion of local and regional development . </s>
of course , the programme alone be not enough ; it must be complement by strenuous effort on the part of the Member States . </s>
on 9 December last year , the Conciliation Committee adopt the definitive text for the programme , thereby pave the way for the future promotion of study and project within the alternative energy sector aim at tap into the potential of renewable energy . </s>
in addition , the continued existence of the ALTENER programme will guarantee the promotion and implementation of pilot project for create and extend infrastructure , for transfer of expertise and for targeted activity intend to relieve market penetration of renewable energy . </s>
this will be of particular relevance to the wind energy and geothermal sector , to smaller-scale hydroelectric powerstations , to the passive and active use of solar energy in building and to the use of biomass . </s>
these sector show us how necessary and important it be to continue to provide a rational support framework at European level in the alternative energy source sector . </s>
I would especially like to thank the Commission and the competent Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , for support Parliament 's position . </s>
the European Parliament have succeed in reach a reasonable compromise and amend the Council 's common position . </s>
I would be grateful if my fellow MEPs would endorse the Conciliation Committee 's end result . </s>
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reach an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme . </s>
firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thank to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he have do on this report . </s>
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan . </s>
for as Mr Langen say just now , we certainly have a tough fight on our hand in the Conciliation Committee . </s>
however , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bear the trademark of the European Parliament throughout . </s>
Mr Langen mention that a series of Parliament 's demand and point it have to make relate to content be adopt and - as have already be mention - we be almost able to meet the council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy source in the Community . </s>
this be not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear . </s>
however , we agree to this compromise because it be important to us to enable this programme to be launch very soon indeed . </s>
for in the course of the next few year , the proportion of renewable energy source be to double , account for at least @card@ % of energy consumption . </s>
this be the European Union 's declare aim . </s>
that be the case , since ALTENER be the only Eu programme to have the exclusive aim of promote renewable energy source , it will certainly be have a key role . </s>
in the first place , this new five-year programme will entail extend the action in the ALTENER I programme . </s>
this will include extend the exchange of information and expertise between operator in the renewable energy source sector , develop local and regional energy agency , and establish new network for approve financial support , to name but a few example . </s>
To my mind though , what be particularly important about the ALTENER II programme be the new action for relieve market saturation by renewable energy and those for implement , support and monitor the Community strategy and the Community action plan . </s>
we now have available to us a work paper from the Commission 's service on a breakthrough campaign , which be in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy . </s>
it contain plan for financial support for all the main renewable energy source sector . </s>
it be very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it . </s>
the overall investment cost for this campaign be estimate to be approximately EUR @card@ billion . </s>
@card@ % @card@ % of this be to come from private source , and this will be supplement by public fund from the Member States and from the region . </s>
in this respect , the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentive and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interest of environmental protection , the economy and create new job . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter . </s>
the conclusion reach regard conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee be , after all the difficult phase it have be through , at least satisfactory . </s>
most of Parliament 's amendment have be take into account and the fact that the programme have see its total funding rise to EUR @card@ million must be see as positive . </s>
the Union have ambitious goal with regard to increase the use of renewable energy . </s>
There be very little in the way of appropriation to meet these target , however . </s>
the appropriation be need for pilot project , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitude towards the use of renewable energy . </s>
the main responsibility for increase the use of renewables be to be bear by the Member States . </s>
this programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with great determination to increase the use of renewable energy . </s>
however , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promote the use of renewable energy and ensure that renewable energy be launch without obstacle on the market . </s>
promote the use of renewables be especially important for the environment . </s>
the Union can achieve its environmental goal unless the use of renewables be actively step up . </s>
renewable energy source low dependency on import energy and their increase use boost competitiveness . </s>
Europe will also be able to achieve a lead position in the industry that supply equipment need for the exploitation of renewable energy . </s>
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy source have a positive impact on regional development and employment . </s>
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ? </s>
Peat be not mention in the list of renewable energy source . </s>
however , it be important , at least in Finland , as a sustainably use , slowly renewable energy source . </s>
I hope that in the future it can be include in the list of renewables . </s>
commissioner , lady and gentleman , the Group of the green / European Free Alliance be please with the agreement which have be find , and their thank go to all those who negotiate so well in favour of an amendment which the green be almost the author of . </s>
it be interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provide for hundred of million of euros annually for tobacco cultivation . </s>
this be a limited sector of the economy which create hardly any job and be not competitive on the world scale . </s>
in contrast with that , I see the amount allocate for renewable energy , which be not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion . </s>
see the market share that small country such as Denmark have be capable of acquire in this field , because they be the first one to develop that area , give one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budget for renewable energy . </s>
One last word regard the programme . </s>
I think it very important for renewable energy to be firmly establish in the region so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there . </s>
in order to ensure that at least @card@ % of the energy mix come from renewable energy source , it be not enough to deal with a few hot spot that will be more profitable in the short term . </s>
Mr President , may I commence by compliment Mr Langen on his work . </s>
the activity of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy source and I believe that such programme merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future . </s>
for this reason , I be particularly please to see the monies focus on project by small and medium-sized enterprise . </s>
the internationally agree objective for reduce emission can be achieve by these programme alone . </s>
in this regard , it must be remember that energy policy remain within the national remit . </s>
it be imperative that national government lend their full support to improve energy efficiency and develop renewables . </s>
I be please that Ireland have recently announce that it be go to spend £ @card@ million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector . </s>
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiative . </s>
as the final text rightly state , action such as these can play a role in reduce regional disparity . </s>
I can vouch that I have already receive significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which fall within Ireland 's only Objective I region . </s>
I support all effort to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provision , include the energy sector . </s>
in short , we face a major challenge in meet our commitment on limit greenhouse gas emission from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promote growth in our economy . </s>
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined effort of the Member States . </s>
Mr President , Mr Langen , lady and gentleman , as our rapporteur mention , we be come to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme . </s>
Mr Langen mention that the implementation budget propose by the Council be initially FF @card@ million , whereas the Commission propose @card@ million , a figure which the European Parliament support . </s>
an initial conciliation meeting be not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR @card@ million . </s>
we could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenge the authority of the European Parliament . </s>
a second round of conciliation achieve an increase of EUR @card@ million in order to reach this compromise figure of @card@ million . </s>
in spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal , personally , once again I deplore the fact that the fund allocate do not match up to the ambition express and that the concern to save money display by the Council in this situation be in rude contrast to its declaration in favour of the safety of the energy supply , job creation and environmental protection , challenge that be just as significant which we must face up to . </s>
in fact , renewable energy unquestionably provide a way of achieve these objective . </s>
however , in spite of the reservation I be express on the paucity of the financial allocation , I personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme 's content , to which the European Parliament make an active contribution as , follow the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , this sector become subject to codecision . </s>
it be practically certain that , with the raft of propose measure and action , it should be possible to approach the objective of a @card@ % renewable energy share by @card@ , double the current rate , as long as the appropriation include state appropriation be make available . </s>
this programme , together with the Save II programme , integrate the environmental aspect into energy policy , establish a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reduce our dependence . </s>
and , in conclusion , Mr President , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measure propose , there be also legislative measure and , most especially , adequate budget allocation to back up these political initiative . </s>
and I shall end , of course , by congratulate Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the member of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee . </s>
. </s>
( ES ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reach on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comment of the different speaker and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporate soon into the framework energy programme . </s>
all of this will provide great coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programme , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discuss soon . </s>
I would like to say that the work carry out during this time by Parliament have be of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen and also all the various speaker who have speak both in committee and here in plenary . </s>
obviously , there have be argument , we have to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron remind us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result be achieve , and there have to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figure be not excessive . </s>
however , I believe that in the end we have reach a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreement , be perhaps not perfect , but which , I believe , allow us to push ahead with the project with which we be deal . </s>
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Langen , on his work , to thank the speaker and , of course , to acknowledge the action of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contribute efficiently to the achievement of a positive result . </s>
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council . </s>
save the next item be the report ( A5-0010 / @card@ ) by Mrs Ahern , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approve by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopt a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - Save ( C5-0334 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) . </s>
madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that be good-tempered all round , which be not always the case . </s>
I be happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text have incorporate all its amendment either in full or in a re-worded form . </s>
the financial amount finally allocate to the programme be also a considerable improvement on the Council 's proposal at second reading which we find completely unacceptable and we have make quite a lot of progress there . </s>
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposal on Save and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading . </s>
I would like to remind the house that at second reading Parliament adopt this report contain eight amendment , include a re-instatement of the Commission 's original budget . </s>
the Commission accept five of the propose amendment include the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council have propose be unacceptable . </s>
during the procedure , agreement be reach on the study and action to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measure . </s>
compromise wording be agree for five other amendment include legislative and non-legislative measure and the inclusion of local energy centre and , very importantly , the energy audit system in the review of progress on energy efficiency . </s>
I hope that you will all agree that this be important progress . </s>
the issue of the financial envelope be staunchly defend by Parliament in the face of the Council 's very meagre opening offer . </s>
in the event we have to have several meeting before the Council finally increase this to a substantial amount . </s>
we get an increase of 2 million on their start figure which be a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirm that it could implement the programme under . </s>
this be an important consideration for us . </s>
I would like to say however that it be , and have always be , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme be more symbolic than real . </s>
funding for energy saving still come primarily from the Member States . </s>
we have to bear that in mind when approve this programme . </s>
if there be more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this be a pity because there be a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , include Community action , on energy saving . </s>
where the Community can step in be to put the local activator in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region . </s>
we have an important part to play in the Community in the European union in this regard . </s>
save be the only Community-wide programme dedicate to promote the rational use of energy . </s>
it focus on non-technical element , help to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme be to create an environment in which investment and energy efficiency will be promote . </s>
here we need to realise that there be also a market opportunity in industry for energy saving . </s>
we have hear a lot about difficulty of competition in renewable energy but energy efficiency save money for business , save money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical . </s>
it be something that we can all support . </s>
I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mother or the people engage in energy-saving . </s>
we could do rather more , consider that we have make great commitment in reduce CO2 and greenhouse gas and to reduce dependence on energy import . </s>
we be not take the kind of action that the citizen want to see . </s>
we be not make the connection so that the citizen can actually do something concretely either at home or in their office or in industry to support action against global climate change . </s>
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do . </s>
I would like once again to thank all who help in this conciliation process . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she have contribute , in collaboration with the other member , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respect even improve on the proposal of the Commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the Council have initially accept . </s>
as Mrs Ahern have explain very well , the budget of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme , be basically symbolic budget , since the burden be shoulder by the country , the States of the Union , the region or even , in some case , the local authority . </s>
however , despite the fact that the volume be relatively small , it be nevertheless symbolically important that there be a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action , which contribute to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitment . </s>
this action also contribute to achieve great diversification in term of our energy source , great safety in our energy supply and , in the case of Save , to reduce consumption and increase efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contribute to achieve the objective set . </s>
furthermore , behind these programme , that be to say , the SAVE programme , which concern great efficiency and energy saving , and the Altener programme , which concern renewable energy , there lie an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunity to industry and also for the creation of job in our country and therefore in the Union as a whole . </s>
with regard to the parliamentary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have act and speak , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of Parliament 's amendment have be incorporate into the proposal accept by the Council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modification . </s>
I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of fund have be achieve . </s>
this improvement have be achieve with fresh fund , as we say at the time , and it have be achieve while safeguard this Parliament 's prerogative and competence . </s>
from the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this be important and I be very happy to highlight it . </s>
I would like once again to thank all the speaker , and also , especially , the Vice-President , Mr Provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Ahern , and all the member who have participate in this work . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ a. m. tomorrow . </s>
culture @card@ the next item be the report ( A5-0009 / @card@ ) by Mr Graça Moura , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approve by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establish a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( ' Culture @card@ ' ) ( C5-0327 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) . </s>
madam President , in spite of Article @card@ of the Treaty of Amsterdam , culture have be the poor relative in term of the reduce range of programme and financial , technical and human resource find for the European project . </s>
some may say that the prevail objective fifty year ago when the &quot; European home &quot; in which we now live be found be more specifically economic and social one . </s>
it may also be say that European policy have suffer , throughout these five decade , from the innumerable and crazy whim that have hold sway in a wide variety of situation and for a wide variety of reason . </s>
however , in the spirit of Europe 's founding father , we must inevitably bear in mind the model for civilisation which lead them to seek to establish lasting condition for peace . </s>
this model for civilisation be root in deep cultural diversity . </s>
a Europe of national identity can live for a long time in peace and prosperity if this cultural diversity maintain its vitality and eliminate the small-mindedness and aggressiveness cause by resentment which , as a rule , give rise to excessively nationalistic feeling . </s>
if this cultural diversity be to succeed , it be vital that there should be mutual understanding and a sharing of the value of civic humanism , tolerance , knowledge and artistic and other form of cultural expression which have take root in Europe 's fertile soil , and which reflect the most noble and profound aspect of the human spirit . </s>
therefore , for this understanding and share to be fully possible , they must be base on a concept of culture which involve the crucial dimension of European democracy . </s>
There be no doubt that genuine convergence , economic and social cohesion , the single currency , the fight against unemployment and social exclusion and even competition be all necessary to create condition which can provide great equality , great development , a good quality of life , and good opportunity for the people of Europe . </s>
There be no doubt that the common security and defence policy could strengthen Europe 's identity and status on the world scene . </s>
There be no doubt that we aim to gain acceptance for our policy on defend human right throughout the world . </s>
if , however , cultural policy can give a superior and clearly distinctive meaning to all of this , neither Europe nor European democracy will be able to make much progress . </s>
it be through culture alone that million upon million of our citizen be able to recognise themselves as European and can cultivate , develop and broaden this feeling of be part of Europe . </s>
this , Madam President , be the kind of impetus that European politics need . </s>
we talk about culture , cultural cooperation , symbolic action , major initiative and network of cultural agent and operator , but any mention of the European institution have a cultural policy be carefully avoid . </s>
this , by the way , would not impinge on the principle of subsidiarity in the slight . </s>
we even speak rhetorically , sometimes in quite reasonable term , about the importance of culture for the European project , and yet ridiculous appropriation be allocate to programme suppose to serve over @card@ million people , on a permanent , ongoing basis . </s>
these programme be design to give them access to a heritage that belong to them and which should stimulate an active and interactive appetite for contact with the high value and with the great work in which they be represent . </s>
the people of Europe whom we represent here have the right to demand a more consistent , effective and above all a more European attitude from the Union 's institution . </s>
these thought be by way of an introduction to this House 's consideration of the joint text of the Culture @card@ programme , which be approve by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December last year . </s>
let us remember that Culture @card@ establish a unique financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation . </s>
the conciliation procedure yield satisfactory solution to almost all the amendment adopt at second reading . </s>
this mean that Parliament 's basic understanding can reasonably be consider to be have be preserve , particularly the political priority to be give to establish condition for action under the Culture @card@ programme to reach the great possible number of people . </s>
with regard to the budgetary aspect of this , Parliament 's delegation come up against the Council 's intransigence on the issue of increase the appropriation from the EUR @card@ million that be originally earmark . </s>
it be still set on a solution which would mitigate this position . </s>
and this be only make possible by Commissioner Reding 's personal commitment to find a constructive solution . </s>
Thank to her , the Commission commit itself to present a report before @card@ June @card@ on the operation of the programme , in which it will state whether the available financial resource be adequate or not . </s>
it may possibly also offer a review of this item . </s>
I can hide the fact that the success of this proposal will depend in the final analysis on an institutional mechanism be find which correspond to the basic meaning of the word &quot; conciliation &quot; . </s>
nevertheless , I shall conclude my speech by propose to this house that it should vote in favour of the joint text adopt by the Conciliation Committee for the Culture @card@ programme and I wish it every success . </s>
madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continue discuss this because we say everything there be to say in the last debate . </s>
unfortunately , there have be no change in the way that the Council always talk about culture but fail to allocate any money for it . </s>
we have the feeling , and be in fact convince , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the thing they write in @card@ in the Treaty of Maastricht . </s>
for no one be very keen to spend money on culture . </s>
sadly that be the case and we must face fact . </s>
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really have chip away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course . </s>
we simply have to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attain our goal in term of content , of course the same could not be say of the financial aspect . </s>
one seem powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually have to reach a unanimous decision . </s>
What kind of horse-trading system be this ? </s>
certainly not a fair one ! </s>
There be always people who be in a position to reject everything and there we be on the other side , beg for a little more money for culture . </s>
it be downright scandalous what go on ! </s>
it be an awful sort of horse-trading , base on unequal position ! </s>
nevertheless , we be please that this programme have turn out in the way that we want it to . </s>
it live up to the expectation the citizen have of us . </s>
we will support small and medium-sized event , not the large one , and we will afford individual citizen and also the small operator easy access . </s>
I believe that the fact that Culture and , fittingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner 's remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programme , which be certainly worthwhile programme for the citizen of the European Union . </s>
if one put all the money together and create synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfy , but then only a tiny bit . </s>
it be my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money . </s>
madam President , I agree with the fine word with which the rapporteur begin his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I be personally a little disappoint with the Council . </s>
on the one hand , it continue to refuse to accept the term &quot; European cultural policy &quot; or other similar term , even undervalue the term of the Treaty , and it define &quot; Culture @card@ &quot; simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more . </s>
on the other hand , it have show complete intransigence with regard to the fund request by this Parliament , which be minimal anyway . </s>
incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen member of the Council , since it be just one , the Netherlands , which be responsible for that intransigence . </s>
it have once again be demonstrate that conciliation be incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council . </s>
this demand make conciliation almost impossible and even affect the dignity of the parliamentary institution . </s>
however , Madam President , these consideration must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union 's most important programme . </s>
by take action in the field of culture , we be directly contribute to the construction of a European soul , especially give the fact that the sub-programmes which make up &quot; Culture @card@ &quot; be superb . </s>
in recent year , these have be amongst the programme most eagerly accept by the young and most dynamic citizen of the European Union . </s>
lastly , I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have form of the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual quality , make him , in my opinion , the well possible rapporteur this report could have have . </s>
congratulation ! </s>
finally , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding , Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani , chairman of the Committee on Culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintain during the entire conciliation process . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thank Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous effort he have put into the discussion of this Culture @card@ programme . </s>
it have be say before , and we have discuss this between ourselves on various occasion , that culture be , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for further the European idea . </s>
it be also of great importance to citizen . </s>
we should , above all , not lose sight of this . </s>
the impetus give to the European idea by this programme be have an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic area such as the Netherlands which not only have national potential , but be also rely on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view . </s>
today , we have arrive at the end of a long road . </s>
I would nonetheless like , as other have do , to touch upon the procedure , which be unclear and , above all , unwanted . </s>
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand . </s>
they be like a snake bite its own tail . </s>
There be little room for negotiation if one of the party state beforehand : anything be open for discussion , as long as the budget stay fix . </s>
as it happen - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiation on this matter have take place at an early stage . </s>
the result be @card@ % growth , so we be not completely dissatisfy with the result . </s>
of course , it be always good to make more fund available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme open up good opportunity for quite a few programme . </s>
I would like to stress that culture be not only fund from this particular pot . </s>
Culture do not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kind of other area . </s>
a great deal of money for culture be also set aside in the structural fund , and this be something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind . </s>
fortunately , I be on the Committee on Regional Policy . </s>
so I myself will make sure that this aspect receive due attention . </s>
I think that we have also opt in favour of allow the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happen to be cancel , then surely this do not benefit the citizen . </s>
I have always give the rapporteur my backing in this respect . </s>
however , I do think that it be necessary , as he always state too , that , in the next IGC , change will be make to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary . </s>
we be very positive about the many improvement which have be make : no more mega-projects , room for cultural network , and sufficient attention to promote reading , translate and translation company . </s>
this be especially important to small linguistic area . </s>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture @card@ . </s>
all that remain for me to say be : time to get down to business . </s>
madam President , all that I want to say have be cover by those fellow member who speak before me and I think there be unanimity among the group in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture . </s>
I too must say that I will be vote for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart . </s>
not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani do not work exceptionally well - they work very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding 's attitude - I think that , give the framework she be operate in , her attitude be particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopt by the Council . </s>
it be shameful ! </s>
that figure of EUR @card@ million for so many year be a disgrace for the European Union ! </s>
when we be compel literally to humiliate theatre group , young musician , pioneer activity in the art , writer , to humiliate them and send them pack with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slip in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign , something oppose , contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence feel because our mission be not just the euro , not just enlargement , nor geostrategic expedient , but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this be indeed a sorry way to end . </s>
so long as we continue to have unanimity , so long as yesterday the Dutch government be able to impose those EUR @card@ million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be tell us what cultural activity we can pursue , we will never progress . </s>
that be why it be very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decision and to cut free so that the European Parliament 's effort to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the government . </s>
madam President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur 's analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture , Mr Gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that be also , considerably difficult . </s>
of course , we feel the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programme , but everyone hope that the Culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique feature of each cultural sector , even - and I could say especially - of the unique feature of less well-known sector . </s>
we hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process . </s>
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other thing in term of make a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people . </s>
and a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its root , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic island that until now be less well-known . </s>
as for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regard culture , one of the programme 's most obvious limitation be the level of funding - we have hear this several time - which censure the fact that the council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - be not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bear witness to this . </s>
the overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of be European citizen : this be why we believe that the Culture @card@ programme , albeit with a scarcity of fund , can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal . </s>
madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture @card@ and add my thank to the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who take over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri . </s>
both of them have do a first-class job . </s>
alongside the debate we have earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it be ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important . </s>
why do I say that culture be important ? </s>
well in simple economic term , Europe 's culture add to genuine prosperity . </s>
where would Europe 's tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ? </s>
but , more importantly than that , cultural activity be what make mankind civilised . </s>
culture be at the root of our democratic belief ; and an uncultured society be not go to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy . </s>
cultural diversity be important , and it be under threat . </s>
however , it be not under threat from Europe . </s>
Many people in my country say they see British culture be under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven 's sake . </s>
we do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish sauna , but it be not from Europe that culture be under threat . </s>
What I do see right across Europe be people drink Coca Cola , eat hamburger , wear baseball cap , watch Hollywood film and often do all this at the same time . </s>
now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation be the way of defend Europe 's culture , but I do believe in lend a help hand when we can . </s>
that be what Culture @card@ be about . </s>
so , I say to the Council of Ministers : keep this programme genuinely under review . </s>
be we do enough ? </s>
and , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have give so far , keep up the good work , we be on your side . </s>
madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Graa Moura , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme . </s>
the Culture @card@ programme be finalise at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council . </s>
the outcome can be consider reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme call for a unanimous decision to be make in the Council . </s>
we have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decision in the area of culture . </s>
it be really strange that legislation that adhere to the codecision procedure when it be be debate require unanimity for it to be pass in the Council . </s>
the framework programme on culture be replace the present kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael programme . </s>
when implementation of the programme begin , I hope in particular that the scope it offer for literature and the translation of book can be utilise to the full . </s>
I believe and hope that , despite the assault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status . </s>
we need the depth of spirit that literature provide in the midst of a culture that have a short attention span and be incline towards the superficial . </s>
literature likewise play an important part in the way it transmit our cultural heritage , increase mutual familiarity and preserve linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongue . </s>
in this connection , I be very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture @card@ programme get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon , the country hold the presidency of the Eu be to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public library . </s>
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of library into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society . </s>
madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , lady and gentleman , somehow or other , today 's agenda have come full circle . </s>
we have have a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of value , about tolerance , human dignity , human right , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other . </s>
Youth , education and cultural policy be important tool for create these value , for give the citizen confidence in the European Union and make it credible in their eye . </s>
the funding approve by the Council for the cultural programme do not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union 's goal . </s>
cultural activity create identity . </s>
cultural activity be an expression of individuality , of an individual 's own personality ; it build relationship and communicate . </s>
we want a colourful Europe . </s>
we want a Europe base on the principle of diversity within unity . </s>
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate difference . </s>
that be why we speak in favour of break down the budget , the allocation of fund that be , into the different type of measure . </s>
that be why we oppose concentrate heavily on large network and network structure , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entity and activity perform by individual ; because we want to see thousand of flower bloom . </s>
I would like to second what the previous speaker have to say . </s>
There be a contradiction in term - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and Conciliation Committee - and it be one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principle of cultural policy that be to create a European consciousness . </s>
madam President , as we have hear , all the group have a common political enemy in the Council . </s>
it be not by chance that the Committee on Culture 's decision be constantly end up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always hold culture hostage to other interest . </s>
in this way , the unanimity principle have show itself to be a blockade instrument of the first order . </s>
the battle for a workable compromise last almost two year , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go-ahead . </s>
the Council could not be move , not even when the precursor programme Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael finish . </s>
a pilot programme be call for to bridge the gap . </s>
this show up the weakness of the European Union 's cultural policy activity once again . </s>
the political fight over funding and programme structuring be out of all proportion to the volume of support . </s>
out of @card@ application in @card@ only @card@ project with a low overall volume of EUR @card@ million could be consider . </s>
the Council be not prepare in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro ! </s>
and so the moderate sum of @card@ million will stand until @card@ . </s>
that be the same as a single , medium-sized , German opera house 's expenditure over the same period , when here in Europe this sum have be earmark for @card@ country over a period of five year ! </s>
There be a blatant discrepancy here ! </s>
and so we be go to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least manage to achieve something in term of content . </s>
previous speaker have already kindly point this out . </s>
we can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day . </s>
perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activity do the European Union good , not harm ! </s>
cultural cooperation - and this be also mention earlier - truly create identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be . </s>
provide support for culture meet with wide-spread acceptance , and this certainly can be say of all policy decision . </s>
What , may I ask , be the Council afraid of ? </s>
madam President , whoever have the honour , like myself , to chair the Committee on Culture , can fail to agree with the comment from various member and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and Commissioner Reding , with whom he work and who , even during the conciliation process , have difficult moment and oppose the council - you have hear this say by everyone . </s>
I have notice how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level have be firmly assert , but there be few opportunity to address all the request that the European States will make . </s>
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we do not manage to adopt a review clause . </s>
however , Mrs Reding be certainly receptive and farsighted , and personally undertake to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few year , and therefore to change the situation . </s>
the cultural programme launch in year past - Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael - be be replace by a single programme , Culture @card@ , where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censure a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone say this afternoon - but which still underline the huge importance of be part of a vast community where cultural interpretation be a democratic factor . </s>
this be not rhetoric , but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unite the European States and constitute a turn point for the European Parliament and the Commission . </s>
we agree with this approach and despite the lack of fund , this evening 's result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe , which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor ; culture then , and an institutional aspect , the basis for structure a vast community , a prerequisite for economic growth , and not the complete opposite , as Europe , in its cultural habit , have perhaps be use to view thing in the past . </s>
man and culture be priority , and culture can result in economic growth . </s>
let us contemplate this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy . </s>
madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weave his way through the rather tough textile and fibre that have make up this conciliation tapestry . </s>
it seem to me when enter the conciliation process for Culture @card@ , have a poet to lead us in our endeavour be entirely appropriate . </s>
again , because these conciliation be not entirely straight forward , we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiate skill in the convoluted field of ensure that cultural expenditure be wisely deploy and give to us in our community . </s>
the fundamental question , it seem to me , that face this Parliament , the Commission and the council be : What be Europe ? </s>
What do it mean and what do Europe give us over and above the parameter of our national boundary ? </s>
Europe be its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why Culture @card@ be so important to us be for this : I will wager that when we ask the question - ' What be Europe ? </s>
' - we answer it by say , ' it be our art , it be our literature and it be our heritage . </s>
' that be what Culture @card@ represent . </s>
it represent the possibility of sustain a European identity in the twenty-first century , an identity which eschew the echo of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty dan la realité . </s>
and more than this - and this be more prosaic , Madam President , it mean that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiative by put them into action in new programme that be comprehensive , that be cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industry to the extent that they now require . </s>
it promote mobility , and it open the door of culture to the socially disadvantaged and exclude . </s>
my only regret be that in promote this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspiration and ensure our ability to deliver . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , we have now come to the end of a long road . </s>
follow the conciliation stage , our institution can now formally adopt the new ' Culture @card@ ' framework programme . </s>
we shall thus , in the course of the next five year , have a tool perfectly suit to develop clear , well-structured and , I be sure , successful measure in order to promote the cultural sector . </s>
it be with great satisfaction that I today welcome this ' happy ending ' in this House , and I thank you for it . </s>
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who work to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process . </s>
I should like to express especial thank to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , particularly to its rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , its chairman , Mr Gargani , the European Parliament delegation and the leader of the political group , the Conciliation Committee and its chairman , Mr Imbeni . </s>
they all make a vital constructive and balanced contribution . </s>
throughout the negotiation , they be of great help and it must be say that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiation be nonetheless complete in record time . </s>
we now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme make it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner . </s>
I would like to express my delight , with you , at this pleasing outcome . </s>
in spite of a budget situation which do not match up to our ambition , these result will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani have just say , that the Commission make a statement regard a mid-term assessment . </s>
it state that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the result of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resource in the context of the Community financial perspective . </s>
if need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieve by @card@ June @card@ . </s>
lady and gentleman , this be a formal commitment , not just word on paper . </s>
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of develop a common cultural area , within which our culture can flourish further in all their unique feature , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enrich and the other citizen of Europe may participate fully in them . </s>
it be thank , too , to Parliament 's action , prefer a number of small-scale measure to be carry out close to the citizen ' cultural root rather than vast measure on a spectacular scale . </s>
this be go to lead us to make ' Culture @card@ ' the programme of the citizen . </s>
the increase participation of our citizen be something I hope and pray for . </s>
I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five year cover by the programme it become a tangible reality . </s>
I know that you , as member of Parliament , in your own region and country , be all go to work together with the programme participant so that all these small flower , as one Member of Parliament say , go to make a vast multicoloured carpet . </s>
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizen , both in personal as well as in social and economic term , but a right which it be our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union . </s>
this be what our European ' Culture @card@ ' programme offer . </s>
it do not compete with the cultural policy implement in the various Member States . </s>
such policy be necessary , and I would like to see them develop further . </s>
it simply add to them , complement them , build a bridge between the various culture of our various country . </s>
I feel therefore that extend and enrich European citizen ' participation in culture be a crucial task , one which justify the effort we make to achieve it , and this be the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union . </s>
a number of member of Parliament have quite rightly raise this point . </s>
if the Union be purely an economic union , then it be a stillborn project . </s>
however , if it be a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it become a living thing . </s>
this be the foundation , lady and gentleman , which I intend to develop , and I shall take the follow five area into special consideration : firstly , provide creative people with opportunity of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserve in our programme . </s>
secondly , encouraging exchange , mobility and training in the cultural sector . </s>
thirdly , promote cooperation between cultural operator . </s>
fourthly , increase audience for culture , with particular emphasis on attract young people to culture and , fifthly , protect the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the people of Europe , and make them well know . </s>
the new programme will , I be sure , in term of its structure and organisation base on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it be essential to our measure . </s>
madam President , I reiterate my thank to Parliament for its support and for , once again , have show the importance it attach to culture in the context of the Union . </s>
I be certain that it will not be disappointed , have give us its support , and I personally undertake to keep Parliament inform , as thing progress , of the various phase of the implementation of our measure and the measure of our citizen , which I hope will be great measure for the future of the Union . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ a. m. tomorrow . </s>
( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) End-of-life vehicle the next item be the debate on the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0006 / @card@ ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the common position establish by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicle [ @card@ / 1 / @card@ - C5-0180 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ] ( Rapporteur : Mr Florenz ) Mr President , nine million car be shredded and scrap every year in Europe . </s>
even though they can no longer be drive , these nine million car may still be trade and move across border ; and not just intra-Community border , but also those outside the Union . </s>
it be therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rule on how these nine million vehicle every year be to be recycle and process . </s>
we believe that the directive have a few weakness that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which be genuinely ground-breaking . </s>
we therefore have a number of amendment . </s>
I personally believe that the scope of the directive go beyond its objective . </s>
I do not think it be necessary for classic car to be part of the directive . </s>
nor do I think that motorcycle should be include , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviate the need for a European directive in this area . </s>
I be not look for such rigidly high recycling quota when it come to special-purpose vehicle either . </s>
I want special-purpose vehicle such as ambulance to have high recovery quota . </s>
this be my main concern in this matter . </s>
in my opinion , the directive solidly regulate the matter of accountability for how a car be dispose of in Europe . </s>
this can be leave as the Commission have propose with the Member States ensure the appropriate collection point for drain car . </s>
this will involve , for example , dispose of more than @card@ million lot of use oil , remove break fluid , etc . </s>
an important part of this directive be the issue of what to do with use part . </s>
What should we do with the shredded product ? </s>
we should not overlook the fact that , although quota be an important point in recycling and recovery , they be by no mean the only point . </s>
do not forget that , in the case of car , @card@ % of environmental impact come through driving , 1 % through recovery and @card@ % through construction . </s>
quota be not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many . </s>
of course we need to aim high , but quota must not become an end in themselves . </s>
we must understand that the big picture be important when it come to the environmental impact of car . </s>
I be far keen to see us move away from today 's car , weigh @card@ kg and drive an average of @card@ km , to a future car capable of drive the same distance but weigh just @card@ kg . </s>
this would at least mean @card@ kg times @card@ km less transportation . </s>
this would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understand the Kyoto Protocol , be the important factor . </s>
we therefore consider that , in future , vehicle which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction method will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quota . </s>
it should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicle ( and there be also talk of 3-litre vehicle ) should receive preferential treatment . </s>
we think they should . </s>
May I say something about cost . </s>
some say that all the cost should be bear by the manufacturer ; that this be only right and in the very good interest of the consumer . </s>
however , this can be seriously question as the manufacturer will pass on all the cost to consumer and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling . </s>
I can only warn you against consent to this . </s>
There be amendment which propose splitting the cost fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car . </s>
the money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from @card@ all vehicle in circulation could be take in without cost to the last holder . </s>
this too be a particular desire of my group . </s>
our proposal to split the cost have a crucial advantage , namely that we win 't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive be adopt . </s>
the car industry be concern about and half expect repercussion , which be a serious problem which we must address accordingly . </s>
this be why I propose splitting the cost between the first holder and the manufacturer . </s>
as for a ban on certain material : of course we need one ! </s>
a car have dangerous component which we must ban long-term . </s>
this mean that we need a pressure instrument . </s>
the Commission have put forward various proposal which be too stringent and we have come up with some alternative . </s>
There be a number of sound amendment . </s>
this Parliament have be give more authority , so let us use it ! </s>
let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive . </s>
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House . </s>
I ask for your support . </s>
Mr President , I almost feel like say , &quot; Phew &quot; , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which have give us so much work , and which have clearly also give a great deal of work to the rapporteur , Mr Florenz . </s>
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it do not answer the real question over what be go to be do with vehicle which have already be abandon and which , today , can only be remove at local authority expense , I. E. the taxpayer ' expense . </s>
the principle of ' polluter pay ' be not be apply . </s>
vehicle already abandon have also be abandon by Community legislation , in that they be not take into consideration either in the text on emission or in this text on end-of-life vehicle . </s>
the only merit of this directive be that it look to the future . </s>
it have not , however , be possible to solve the problem of vehicle currently be use but which be already old and which cost far more to recycle . </s>
on the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the effort that car manufacturer be prepare to make in order to find ( a ) material that be easy to recycle and ( b ) to set up recycling industry . </s>
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling , reuse and incineration , as far as the new particularly light material be concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emission . </s>
this be a problem of compatibility between our directive on end-of-life vehicle and the former directive , include the one on auto-oil , which we vote on a few year ago . </s>
we must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on have the wisdom , in order to make thing perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause make an exception of the vintage car which be part of our industrial and cultural heritage . </s>
in conclusion , let me say that this directive be not ambitious enough to solve the problem of present car number and it be rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserve for the wreck which still clutter our forest , lake and garden . </s>
once again , the principle of ' polluter pay ' be not be apply . </s>
the taxpayer be still foot the bill . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , read the leaflet which have be distribute in recent week , one would think that we be talk about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe . </s>
neither be correct . </s>
we simply must realise that the directive on the table be a sound directive . </s>
it mean ecological progress for Europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enact it and set it in motion . </s>
All the same , there be one point on which we be in conflict . </s>
in the grand scheme of the directive , it be perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one . </s>
it concern the issue of recycling cost . </s>
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odd with last year 's debate in the council when freedom from cost for the last owner and the issue of financing be lump together and a question mark place over whether the last owner should really be free from cost . </s>
last February in this House we unambiguously decide ( and we Social Democrats be stick to this ) that the matter of freedom from cost for the last owner be not open to question ! </s>
so who will pay for the vehicle which be to be dispose of ? </s>
for us this be straightforward : in the case of new vehicle it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturer to design and build recyclable car . </s>
and what about vehicle which be already on the road ? </s>
let us look at an example . </s>
Rover in Great Britain , if they be responsible for all end-of-life car , would actually be responsible for @card@ million car within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR @card@ million against recycling cost , whereas a manufacturer from Korea build similar car would only have to shell out peanut , as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it . </s>
such distortion in competition be not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the job of those building car in Europe . </s>
consequently , for end-of-life vehicle we propose set up a fund to cover the cost of recycle end-of-life vehicle in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from cost . </s>
I can understand it when colleague from country which do not build car advocate that manufacturer should pay the full whack and that they be not interested in the problem of distortion in competition when it come to set aside fund . </s>
however , I would ask these colleague to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from build car in Europe , so that these job can be secure in the future . </s>
I be in favour of stringent environmental requirement , as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emission , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone ! </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive . </s>
firstly , because it clearly stipulate the environmental objective . </s>
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which be important . </s>
thirdly , because it set out a clear procedure to combat pollution cause by heavy metal . </s>
this be also an important point . </s>
the directive afford a European framework , also to Member States who already have system in place and who wish to continue to use these . </s>
so , first of all , we need to keep the recycle percentage at their present level . </s>
this will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identify way of deal with material that we do not as yet know how to dispose of . </s>
secondly , we need to retain the detail as they be include in the common position . </s>
as from @card@ , therefore , all vehicle should be hand in at no cost to their last owner . </s>
needless to say , this be most definitely an essential point which should not be change in any way . </s>
be this too much of a burden ? </s>
There be , however , one thing we should not overlook . </s>
the directive apply to complete car , that be to say car with none of the essential component miss . </s>
accord to the expert , few of these complete car be of no value . </s>
after all , recycling and the re-use of component form part of a sector which be not necessarily loss-making . </s>
Quite the reverse , in fact . </s>
at present , there be a whole raft of company which make a live out of them , and a decent one at that . </s>
this directive encourage the whole of this sector . </s>
it be a sector which comprise small and medium-sized business . </s>
since , in this case , transport cost be high , a system will have to be introduce which will need to be very much decentralise , because transport an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than @card@ km be not a profitable activity . </s>
I think it be a good thing that this directive do not need to apply to historic vehicle , and I think we ought to add this provision to it . </s>
I think , therefore , that vintage car ought to be exempt . </s>
also , it be a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer . </s>
that be a basic principle which we must uphold . </s>
as manufacturer be responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase . </s>
we must also insist that the cost be bear wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulate in the common position . </s>
I find this a well-balanced formula which do not preclude a number of other thing . </s>
I think we need to retain it . </s>
this be why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence . </s>
after all , we be all aware how difficult it be within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it be a very difficult balance act to reach this common position . </s>
in my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it be a directive which we desperately need for environmental reason . </s>
I would ask you to support this common position . </s>
our group will , at any rate , do this as far as possible - for environmental reason and because we have this directive which be well-balanced and encompass a whole range of issue and difficulty include , for example , the way in which the cost be to be distribute . </s>
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today . </s>
do this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer 's liability , that be to say that car , once they have reach the end of their life , be the responsibility of the car manufacturer ? </s>
no , accord to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. @card@ : car manufacturer and car driver should split the cost @card@ / @card@ . </s>
it be evident from the packaging directive in which this @card@ / @card@ compromise be include that this do not work . </s>
packaging still account for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and be a burden upon the environment . </s>
some of the socialist under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until @card@ or @card@ accord to Amendment No @card@ . </s>
the common position stipulate @card@ . </s>
accord to the group of the Greens , this give the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparation . </s>
I would therefore urge my colleague not to support Amendment no @card@ of the Christian Democrats and Amendment no @card@ of some of the socialist . </s>
if car manufacturer need to bear the cost of recycle their car , they will design these car in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply . </s>
the problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in car and these product will be replace by plant-based bioplastic . </s>
this be ultimately cheap , also for the consumer . </s>
for twenty year , the majority within Parliament have attempt to make European environmental policy green . </s>
today , this green position be be threaten under pressure from , in particular , the German and French car industry . </s>
that be why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ . </s>
we , the Green Group , by and large support the common position . </s>
Mr President , the waste from end-of-life vehicle be one of our really major environmental problem in term both of the quantity of waste and of emission of environmentally hazardous substance . </s>
we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulation as be humanly possible in this area . </s>
with this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presuppose that the Council 's position be not tear to shred and weaken in Parliament 's reading of it . </s>
if they be adopt , many of the amendment which have be table would considerably weaken the directive . </s>
this apply , above all , to amendment from the Group of the European People 's Party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendment from Mr Lange , as I see it . </s>
it be easy to see that the car industry in certain country , for example in Germany , go in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive be adopt . </s>
for ourselves , it be crucial that the follow principle should apply . </s>
the polluter should pay . </s>
this mean that it be the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicle . </s>
There must be rule govern existing vehicle too . </s>
where this aspect be concern , we can accept any weakening of the Council 's position regard the date from which the regulation be to come into force . </s>
There should be no falling-off in the percentage concern or in the requirement for recycle vehicle from particular year , and it be important to limit the use of dangerous substance such as lead . </s>
we shall vote against any amendment which run counter to these consideration . </s>
if those amendment be adopt which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament 's credibility on environmental issue . </s>
reference be make earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be give to the million of people who work in the car industry in various country and to those country which have large car industry , for example my own country , Sweden . </s>
I be myself a car worker before I be elect . </s>
I believe I be one of the few member of this Parliament to have stand beside a production line and assemble car . </s>
I think that very tough demand should be make of the car industry . </s>
these would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturer who think in environmentally friendly term . </s>
it be precisely this type of car industry which we should be encourage in the European Union . </s>
Mr President , I be very please that environmental protection be now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it be for the citizen of Europe . </s>
There be no doubt that abandon car represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment . </s>
our citizen expect us in this regard to protect their interest . </s>
each year , there be between 8 and 9 million vehicle scrap within the European Union . </s>
this in itself generate a large amount of waste . </s>
car manufacturer , the supplier of material and equipment manufacturer must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substance and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled material can be use in the manufacture of car . </s>
we know that in the Netherlands there be authorise treatment centre in place to collect end-of-life vehicle and this process should be extend across the length and breadth of the European Union . </s>
from an Irish perspective , I know that the Irish Department of the Environment be already have consultation with motor industry representative to ensure that appropriate collection centre be put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicle . </s>
I see no reason why licensing arrangement can be organise across Europe for collection centre to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicle which be dispose of within the European union on an annual basis . </s>
car manufacturer will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of use car which will be achieve in the come year . </s>
in accordance with new provision include in the Amsterdam Treaty all the @card@ million consumer within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information . </s>
I believe Eu consumer will support those car manufacturer that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practice in the come year . </s>
my final point be that the regulation and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic consideration . </s>
Mr President , the directive on end-of-life vehicle be certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe . </s>
I also think that a great effort have be make to arrive at intelligent recycling of material , a reduction of pollute waste and the promotion of technological innovation . </s>
in this regard , we be certainly on the right track , but as some member have already stress , the real issue here be the possibility that manufacturer ' responsibility will become a share responsibility . </s>
I would like to say that in Italy , considerable headway have be make in this sector ; we be perhaps the first in Europe to have regulation encourage us to take end-of-life vehicle off the market , but in our country the average age of car on the road be rather high , and we therefore have serious concern over the problem that this directive could entail for the market . </s>
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter . </s>
in Italy , we have begin to withdraw and recycle around @card@ % of old car , but there be a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in term of unemployment give that in Italy industry often resort to lay-off and redundancy - and cause problem for worker in different part of Italy . </s>
we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirement - Parliament be sometimes a little extremist , adopt position that be either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and , all thing consider , find a way to combine the effort make by Mr Florenz and that of other member , who be try to reconcile the two position as good as possible . </s>
these worthwhile amendment be the outcome of this ; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that be , to reconcile environmental requirement with market and labour requirement . </s>
Mr President , this directive deal with the comparatively small but grow problem of abandon car and the question of a more structured disposal of all car at the end of their life . </s>
To that extent , it might be think desirable , even if it be not a matter of urgent necessity . </s>
the key question now be who pay the EUR @card@ per car for the 9 million car that be dispose of each year ? </s>
who pay for the collection , the dismantle , the disposal and so on ? </s>
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that have ever be make ? </s>
the proposal from the Council , the common position , be that manufacturer should pay the lot . </s>
that would mean billion of pound or euros for each of the major company in each of the country of the European Union . </s>
that cost would inevitably be pass on to the price and hence to the buyer of new car . </s>
because European car manufacture have be operate here for many , many more decade than company from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much great burden on the old European company and a competitive gift to their competitor from elsewhere . </s>
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and other who have seek from both side of the party divide a compromise base on shared cost . </s>
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleague from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure . </s>
retrospective law be bad law , it be unfair law and often it be unworkable law . </s>
most democratic parliament in the free world reject it on principle unless there be overwhelming public interest , which clearly there be not in this case . </s>
that be why I have call for a roll-call vote on this . </s>
we can see who be prepare to vote for a retrospection which be of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry . </s>
Mr President , once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issue involve in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendment table by my colleague , Bernd Lange . </s>
these amendment actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconcile environmental constraint and economic imperative . </s>
the Council 's common position be to say that car manufacturer should bear all , or a significant part , of the cost of recovery and recycling . </s>
but , as Mr Lange so rightly say , this solution be totally unfair to European car manufacturer . </s>
come from a country which do have a car manufacturing industry , I can tell you that it be not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial cost for all vehicle of their make currently on the road , i. e. effectively make them bear the cost arise from @card@ % of the total number of car in Europe . </s>
this solution be unacceptable because these car manufacturer have not have the opportunity to build the environmental demand we be make of them today into their manufacturing procedure and their manufacturing cost . </s>
the common position put European car manufacturer in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturer which have just come to the European market . </s>
of course , we be not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby . </s>
we be here to build a Europe that be competitive on the world market and to safeguard job in economic sector where we be actually competitive . </s>
this be why , I urge you to support the amendment table by Bernd Lange . </s>
these amendment will be support by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interest involve - economic interest and environmental constraint - while grant Member States the freedom to select the mean to implement these constraint , since these amendment envisage that the system in place in the Members States , and some of them work perfectly well , will be able to continue to operate . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the propose directive on end-of-life vehicle before us today aim firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union , but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector . </s>
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicle must , of course , be exempt from the scope of this directive . </s>
car be also part of our cultural heritage . </s>
I think we would all agree on that . </s>
have say that , one of the stumble block concern Article @card@ , I. E. the date on which the directive will come into force . </s>
Parliament 's propose solution of @card@ month follow the directive 's entry into force , for new vehicle , be not terribly realistic . </s>
the European car population amount to several ten of million of car which will have to be recover even though they be not design for recycling . </s>
the common position be more feasible since it envisage @card@ for vehicle already on the road . </s>
this would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firm time to make fund available to meet these additional expense . </s>
like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offer a balanced compromise between constraint upon firm and essential advance in environmental protection . </s>
Mr President , the European Parliament be today face an important decision . </s>
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or , as the amendment of Florenz , Lange and other cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry ? </s>
the credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection be at stake . </s>
it would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament be to draw back from the profession the government of the @card@ Member States and the European Commission have be make concern manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection ! </s>
the intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendment be obvious : to sabotage the directive ! </s>
the propose shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pay principle and detract from product innovation . </s>
in set up numerous hurdle their sole aim be to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by go down the road of type approval they seek to delay the implementation of the directive by @card@ year or more . </s>
this be totally unacceptable . </s>
I therefore appeal to the German delegate in particular to prevent major political damage occur today ! </s>
the red-green federal government have not exactly cover itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive . </s>
do not continue in this vein ! </s>
the whinge about competitive disadvantage be laughable if it only concern competitive disadvantage sustain by the German car industry . </s>
start represent your people and not just your car manufacturer ! </s>
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry ! </s>
Mr President , this directive have be under discussion since @card@ . </s>
it be high time that we reach an agreement . </s>
since I more or less share the view of my colleague , Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens , Mr de Roo , I be not go to use the two minute allot to me , and I will highlight just two issue . </s>
firstly , and this be perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which go hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use material which will subsequently cause less pollution . </s>
another point be that waste should not be incinerate or crush , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contain PVC . </s>
Parliament be currently discuss this issue in another context . </s>
the other question be who should bear the cost . </s>
I agree with previous speaker who have say that the polluter should pay , and this proposal express that idea very well . </s>
producer must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequence of this - and they must take responsibility for the cost before @card@ , as some of the amendment propose . </s>
we be more in agreement with the amendment propose at first reading . </s>
it be also important to set percentage and a date for vehicle to be compose of recyclable material . </s>
I believe that this proposal rely on very long deadline . </s>
lastly , Mr President , I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized business which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorise , can promote the creation of job in this very important area , prevent the emergence of monopoly by large company . </s>
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibility . </s>
we have to work out what we be go to do with the million of vehicle we abandon each year . </s>
in some of our Member States , voluntary environmental agreement have already be sign to ensure that our ditch , canal and field be not fill with these ugly and dangerous wreck , inhabit occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken . </s>
I come , of course , from a country that be proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third country . </s>
I can gauge its importance for my country 's international reputation . </s>
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which have set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantle end-of-life vehicle . </s>
I be aware of the difficulty the council experience in find a compromise . </s>
that be why , today , we must be understand alchemist , concern for our environment . </s>
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not . </s>
as far as I be concern , at least , the principle of ' polluter pay ' must be apply . </s>
the car industry , increasingly more respectful of the environment , have , I be sure , anticipate this kind of increase awareness . </s>
indeed it be accept its responsibility . </s>
it be the Member States , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let us beware of go into too much detail because the industrial tradition , the demolition and crush sector vary accord to whether you be in Italy or in Finland . </s>
I be oppose to make the car owner liable . </s>
the man and woman on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter , pay their national taxis and the tax on fuel and be therefore already pay a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement . </s>
it would certainly be unwise for my fellow member in the major group of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by create a liability share between the owner and the manufacturer . </s>
How , furthermore , can a fund be create which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operation within Europe . </s>
who be to pay for recycle the car I buy in France if I register it in Belgium ? </s>
which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ? </s>
let us beware , too , of worry the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application . </s>
it be not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advocate sustainable development . </s>
Mr President , most of the time , the European Parliament , spearhead by environment committee , do its very good to make a critical assessment of the proposal submit by the European Commission or the Council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view . </s>
now , a sound common position submit by the Council be in danger of be change for the bad from an environmental point of view here in Parliament . </s>
every year , we discard a huge amount of car which contain many dangerous substance . </s>
this be why it be important to prevent waste material . </s>
we should also aim for minimum quantity of heavy metal , as well as of other dangerous substance and material . </s>
in addition , car manufacturer need to produce and build these car in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantle and re-use . </s>
What be leave of the strip vehicle also require to be process adequately . </s>
I therefore welcome with open arm the percentage level for re-use and recycling which have be propose by the Council . </s>
these day , the complete dismantle of end-of-life vehicle be economically viable . </s>
this mean that we move away from shred . </s>
the prescribed objective be most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of @card@ % recycling have now already be achieve . </s>
the good way of achieve proper collection be to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorise treatment facility without any cost . </s>
the processing cost can then be incorporate in the price of new car . </s>
the proposal make by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system . </s>
the so-called shared liability be very cumbersome and do not stimulate innovation . </s>
if the system of deliver car to treatment facility without any cost be apply , it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably . </s>
finally , this directive should enter into force at the early opportunity . </s>
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment . </s>
why can we just be satisfy with the common position currently table ? </s>
if we be , then all that remain for us to do be to congratulate the council on the result achieve . </s>
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem . </s>
he have deliver excellent work under pressure both from his colleague and from the car industry . </s>
add to this the fact that he have to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . </s>
that be not easy . </s>
overall , I be not dissatisfy with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlie that common position . </s>
I would like to comment on two thing . </s>
firstly , vintage car and motorbike . </s>
these should indeed be exclude from the directive . </s>
secondly , the controversial question as to who bear the responsibility for take back car . </s>
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way . </s>
the manufacturer be and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost . </s>
in my opinion , there be too much initial hesitation . </s>
the car lobby have lead too many people up the garden path . </s>
I would also like to mention that experience have nonetheless teach us that the processing cost be in fact pass on . </s>
these cost be not very high . </s>
in the Member State where I come from , you be talk about @card@ guilder per car . </s>
if you charge this from day one , you can process the old car straight away . </s>
a very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which use to be a common feature in our Member States , would then disappear . </s>
I do not wish to make any change to this particular aspect of the compromise . </s>
I think it would be a good thing if we be to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible . </s>
this be positive because , in that way , the nine million car which be introduce each year onto European road will actually be process appropriately , and this will benefit us all . </s>
Mr President , the present directive be important in so far as it help prevent our be face with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicle and in so far as it promote the re-use and recycling of material from scrap car . </s>
I therefore think it be crucial for the environment that the ban on use poisonous heavy metal should be fully implement and that we should not reduce manufacturer ' liability . </s>
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturer the incentive to design and produce car which give rise to less waste . </s>
the common position , which be arrive at with great difficulty in the Council , which the Commission have endorse and which be also maintain in Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , comply fully with the environmental requirement . </s>
I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendment from member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the objective of which be to weaken the environmental requirement and significantly reduce car manufacturer ' liability . </s>
if these amendment be adopt , I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issue . </s>
so far , we here in Parliament have be positive catalyst for environmental protection but now , if the amendment propose by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange be adopt , we be to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe . </s>
What be more , if we reduce manufacturer ' liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequence for subsequent matter in other area , for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computer and other electronic equipment . </s>
I would therefore recommend to member of Parliament that we cut across party line and vote against all the amendment to the common position which would weaken environmental standard and reduce manufacturer ' liability . </s>
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result . </s>
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dump of old car , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturer to design car which can easily be recycle . </s>
now who should pay the cost ? </s>
whatever system be adopt , ultimately the cost will be pass on to the consumer . </s>
the good way of achieve our environmental objective be to make the manufacturer our instrument both for collect the money and for dispose and recycle of the car . </s>
the manufacturer have trick Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into table amendment here which seriously weaken these proposal . </s>
do not be fool by the car manufacturer ! </s>
if you want the full benefit of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendment . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate be not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think . </s>
it have become eminently political . </s>
yesterday we honour our institution with a political debate . </s>
today , if @card@ member of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturer , we should be do ourselves dishonour . </s>
in expect consumer to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicle , as Amendment no @card@ stipulate , even though the common position state that all recovery cost should be bear by the manufacturer , Parliament would , for the first time , not be act as the defender of the right of the consumer and citizen of Europe , it would be turn into mere sound box for different lobby . </s>
we can accept this . </s>
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sort of pressure in many other area . </s>
it would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weaken a Council position , whereas usually we be complain that their position be not strong enough . </s>
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicle and raise the percentage to be recycle will increase recycling activity and the number of job this generate accordingly . </s>
thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new job to be create in recycling , the Council 's common position definitely must not be amend . </s>
it be , as it stand , perfectly acceptable . </s>
Mr President , like so many other here today , I believe this be a good measure . </s>
this be a useful measure and it be one which we all need . </s>
most of the technical issue have be resolve . </s>
There be some detail to be finalise but most of the technical issue have be resolve . </s>
we have arrive at the final question . </s>
in the first reading debate it be only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which ask this question and it be only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who pose that question in Parliament . </s>
that be quite simply : who pay ? </s>
the Council common position reach a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturer should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bowis have mistakenly say . </s>
in fact perhaps as little , the lawyer tell us , as @card@ % or one-fifth of the cost . </s>
that be not unreasonable . </s>
if you look at the UK consumer for example , who buy a Rover , as Mr Lange have indicate or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who have for year be pay excessive price for those car , over and above comparable price in other part of Europe , why should they pay ? </s>
they have pay already . </s>
why should the very same people as taxpayer or as future car buyer , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer have make the profit from ? </s>
I can accept that . </s>
There be amendment here today that be propose that should be the case . </s>
I can accept it and I will not vote for it . </s>
the responsibility for these car lie with the manufacturer . </s>
it be the manufacturer who have to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal . </s>
the common position do not preclude the possibility of contribution be make by government . </s>
the common position be a reasonable compromise . </s>
some of the amendment today be totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of pay a little if any of the cost of disposal of car on the road . </s>
I can accept that and on behalf of the taxpayer and the consumer of Europe I be vote against those amendment . </s>
Mr President , there be agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life car , although in this instance the Council have not provide a model for a suitable European environment policy . </s>
it be disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handle this matter . </s>
firstly , Herr Trittin , the Environment Minister , be not in tune with his colleague in the Cabinet , then Chancellor Schröder blunder in like a bull in a china shop , have no expert knowledge of this process . </s>
mind you , even the resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June be not the good result that could have be do achieve . </s>
There be certain weakness , the great of which , in my opinion , be that not enough consideration be be give to the situation of small business ; after all , the car industry be more than just large company . </s>
it be in the area of supply that small business play an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interest of those employ in small and medium-sized enterprise . </s>
for there be considerably more than two million people employ in this sector . </s>
the plight of small business be also address by numerous amendment from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendment in question from our group to Article 5 concern cost . </s>
the common position be also no great shake from an environmental viewpoint . </s>
it fail to take in the big picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens say that this be the first time that the European Parliament have tone down a common position , I really must object , because quite simply , it be not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low-consumption car such as the 3-litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by mean of rigid , high recycling quota ! </s>
consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permit exception in the case of particularly economical car . </s>
the objection of the industry in this matter be certainly not without foundation . </s>
however , the argument of the plastic and car industry would be more persuasive if a commitment be to be give to reduce CO2 level in Europe in other sector besides these . </s>
Mr President , we be indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental value will take the side of the Council in their common position . </s>
in contrast to what the previous speaker say , I can say I be really proud that a common position be achieve during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental value . </s>
if we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling cost , we will be create a loophole : we will not have create a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibility be in order . </s>
that be why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the great share of the responsibility . </s>
only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , take into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encourage to make vehicle whose part can be recycle at the small possible cost in the future . </s>
Mr President , there be two issue of principle in the Council 's draft directive . </s>
the first concern the manufacturer 's unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicle . </s>
There be the risk of create a monopoly within the car dismantle trade . </s>
this particularly apply in area within the Eu where distance be great and where a lot of small company be involve in dismantle vehicle . </s>
I believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concern , the Eu 's directive should not treat small company within the Union unfairly . </s>
unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturer would also be in danger of create a situation in which the market for use car part disappear , for manufacturer would have a great responsibility to sell new part . </s>
yet the trade in use car part be important , especially for those who collect and renovate old vehicle . </s>
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturer be also dubious in term of the principle govern the market economy . </s>
it should be possible for change to be make to company and for the latter to be sell and wind up . </s>
they should be able to establish themselves in new market , but also to leave old market . </s>
To bind manufacturer by mean of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accord with a flexible market economy design to promote development . </s>
the second principle in the Council 's common position be the retroactive element in the draft directive . </s>
it conflict with establish economic and legal principle retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product . </s>
To do so also change the owner 's liability retroactively . </s>
over the year , a consumer may have alter the product in a number of way . </s>
every country within the Eu now have rule govern the scrapping of car . </s>
some may be good than other , and some bad . </s>
in anticipation of this Eu directive be be implement , Eu country ought however to be individually liable for scrap vehicle in the good way possible so that the retroactive element in the Eu legislation be not apply . </s>
this do not conflict with a financing model involve the building up of fund . </s>
Mr President , everyone agree with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question . </s>
the common position offer an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restrict the opportunity for improvement , and put the whole directive at risk . </s>
I therefore maintain that Parliament can force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefin the environmental scope of the instrument . </s>
I would remind you that car manufacturer have admit that they can live with the directive ; the cost be not excessive : recycle a car cost less than 1 % of the price of a new car . </s>
moreover , the manufacturer will not be financially accountable until @card@ , when a good number of the existing vehicle will no longer be on the market . </s>
as for the remain vehicle , we could nevertheless provide for some means of share cost , as be propose in Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ by Mr Lange , the only one that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trial underway in some country , and we should therefore support them . </s>
Mr President , this be an extremely bad directive . </s>
first of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis have point out , it be retrospective and that be wrong in principle . </s>
secondly , it dump huge cost on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment . </s>
in this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and job in Europe and yet we constantly pass measure which will have the effect of reduce employment . </s>
I suggest to you that the directive be bad in another respect , which have not be examine well enough in this debate . </s>
it be like so much European legislation . </s>
it be far too prescriptive . </s>
it set in stone one particular model of recycling . </s>
the production line be invent about a hundred year ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we be propose to do here be to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicle , to take the piece apart and seek to recycle them . </s>
One thing we should stop and think about be the fact that there be a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumper of car . </s>
the plastic industry for the most part do not want to take these thing back and can economically do so . </s>
There be already a very successful industry out there which be shred car , recover metal and recover energy by the incineration of the non-metallic part . </s>
this be a very environmentally reasonable approach . </s>
it be just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery . </s>
this method of disposal of car carry no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pay because the &quot; dead &quot; car would actually have a small value go into the recycling and reclamation process . </s>
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it be too prescriptive , it ignore what be actually go on in the car recycling market at the moment and it set in stone method which be not necessarily the well environmentally , and be certainly very damaging economically . </s>
Mr President , the common position be sound , but it be up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicle . </s>
the social-democratic Group have submit a few important proposal for improvement over the past couple of day . </s>
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No @card@ , in which a choice be make in favour of lay the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer , for new car at any rate . </s>
consequently , consideration will also be give to recycling during the conception phase and production . </s>
for the car currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by set up a fund such as that in the Netherlands . </s>
the common position stipulate that manufacturer should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end-of-life vehicle . </s>
this be a big problem in my opinion . </s>
I urge that car manufacturer should most definitely not be give the task of organise the dismantle and recycle of vehicle , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand component market . </s>
they would then determine their own price . </s>
Anyone who have be in an old car know that this be to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic . </s>
the European consumer organisation , which have ask us to support the common position on this point , be to my mind let the consumer down . </s>
a second argument for keep the dismantle of car out of the manufacturer ' clutch be the cost of transport . </s>
if car manufacturer all set up their own dismantle company , this will necessitate transport end-of-life vehicle over long distance . </s>
this be environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and do not benefit the consumer either . </s>
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No @card@ . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I have ask to speak again so that I can say a few more word at the close of this debate . </s>
if you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free . </s>
you will also find that these car be suitably dispose of , that new material flow have be open up in order to recycle material , that @card@ % of the weight of a car be recycle and that @card@ % of all car in the Netherlands be recycle . </s>
this be finance by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contribute . </s>
Should this be condemn ecologically , Frau Breyer ? </s>
I do not think so . </s>
the Netherlands have an exemplary model for dispose of car as per the wish of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end-of-life vehicle currently drive around , the manufacturer , have nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ecology ; it be a simple question of competition ! </s>
the issue here be whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR @card@ million or a Korean manufacturer , say , EUR 2 million . </s>
in term of the people who build car here in Europe , I be in favour of not make competition unequal but , in term of environmental protection , I want freedom from cost for the last owner , to be finance by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new car , which will force them to assume responsibility for build recyclable car ! </s>
( applause from the PSE Group ) Mr President , the proposal we be discuss have a huge amount of advantage , mainly in the interest of prevent waste and encouraging re-use , the recovery and recycling of component and the recovery of material , etc . </s>
I think we have table a sound proposal . </s>
the main thread of the discussion be about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost . </s>
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system function there without any problem . </s>
we have reach an agreement with all the party involve . </s>
these include car manufacturer , second-hand car dealer , the federation of the car industry , the metal processing firm , shred firm and the government . </s>
an environmental policy agreement have be sign on a voluntary basis . </s>
the car industry - and Belgium produce a great many cars- do not have any problem with that . </s>
Belgian can deliver their car back to the vendor without any cost . </s>
in connection with this , we have notice how - quite contrary to what have be say here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small business have take the recycling of material to heart and be do very well . </s>
some business have become hi-tech business , because they manage to recycle certain material , even material which be not yet include in the directive . </s>
so this means that we be develop a new sector and new employment and do the environment a huge favour into the bargain . </s>
I be in favour of collection free of charge . </s>
it work for us . </s>
why would it not work elsewhere ? </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important argument have be present . </s>
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minute . </s>
allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumption and principle behind the present directive . </s>
allow me also to begin by comment on and respond to a couple of the most important argument in this debate . </s>
first of all , I think I should repeat some of the basic fact which Mr Florenz and other have already mention . </s>
What we be discuss here be the fact that close on ten million car be scrap every year in the European Union , result in approximately as many million of ton of waste . </s>
this mean that almost ten million ton of waste be create by these car , and approximately seven per cent of the latter be abandon out in the open . </s>
moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substance of the bad kind . </s>
approximately ten per cent of lead production be to be find in car , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substance . </s>
this be something you already know , but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who be listen . </s>
car be one of the fast grow source of waste we have in Europe . </s>
we know that waste from car exist and we know how we ought to be deal with it , and there be no excuse for not take action . </s>
the present directive have three aim . </s>
first of all , we want to stop heavy metal from be use in the manufacture of new car . </s>
secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer be liable . </s>
we can no longer take care of these matter at the end of a product 's life-cycle . </s>
instead , we should avoid create so much waste . </s>
we should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various content of a product . </s>
thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objective specify in the present directive . </s>
these be the three most important aim of the directive . </s>
this be , of course , because it be a waste of resource for us not to ensure that material in car be recycle . </s>
it be , above all , the manufacturer 's resource we be waste if we do not get to grip with a car 's life-cycle . </s>
Two important question have arise in this regard . </s>
yes , there be in fact more than two question , but I want to mention just two of the most important . </s>
first of all : who should pay ? </s>
and secondly : be we reduce the European car industry 's competitiveness by mean of the present proposal ? </s>
the first question , then , be about who should pay . </s>
the directive state that the polluter should pay and that the cost be to be bear mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principle to be find in the Eu 's treaty concern the manufacturer 's liability . </s>
it be nonetheless clear that the cost will be bear jointly by manufacturer and consumer . </s>
we have calculate that the cost of recycling car do not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car . </s>
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we be not to adopt this directive ? </s>
No . </s>
clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much great . </s>
moreover , the cost will have to be bear in the future . </s>
the cost will not therefore disappear , but now we be clarify whose liability it be and how the cost be to be distribute . </s>
be we therefore talk about a car industry in crisis ? </s>
be it an unprofitable industry which we be discuss and which we really have to help by not impose more taxis upon it ? </s>
be it the case that the car industry definitely can afford these ? </s>
be it the case that the motive behind the propose measure be in actual fact concern with reduce the competitiveness of the European car industry ? </s>
no , of course not . </s>
it be quite the opposite . </s>
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly car and more fuel-efficient car be go to decline in the future ? </s>
What kind of requirement do you think our child and grandchild and future legislator be go to make of car ? </s>
naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment . </s>
it be , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry . </s>
we must create form of motive power which be not damage to health and which be of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recycle material and compete by mean of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient car . </s>
the fact that we have a European car industry which have already make great stride more than properly compensate for the fact that there be , in fact , a good many car on European road for which they must take responsibility . </s>
the cost be not insurmountable ; nor be the task an impossible one . </s>
if we develop motive power of the kind I have describe , I be quite certain that market force and commercial interest in the car industry will ensure that mechanism develop for deal with both the cost and the workload . </s>
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling system . </s>
the industry itself will ensure that these system be introduce in Europe . </s>
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry . </s>
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually produce environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient car . </s>
we must do this for the sake of the environment . </s>
the cost will not disappear . </s>
nor will the waste disappear . </s>
but , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayer or citizen , foot the bill . </s>
What be more , the cost will be high the longer we wait before take action . </s>
that be what I should like to say by way of introduction . </s>
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there be to be any retroactive legislation . </s>
if we assume that , on average , a car have a life of eleven year , do member , indeed do anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven year before we get to grip with this problem ? </s>
do you think that , when we legislate about chemical , we should say that we be ignore those chemical which be already on the market and that we be legislate only for what be to be produce in the future ? </s>
clearly , we must consider the problem which exist here and now and the challenge present by the existing range of car . </s>
it be still not an insurmountable problem . </s>
we can deal with it . </s>
we already have an infrastructure . </s>
we have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life car . </s>
I naturally hope that the result of today 's vote will be a good one . </s>
if I have not already do so , I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he have put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . </s>
in fact , it be in many respect pioneer work when it come to re-use and manufacturer 's liability . </s>
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effect on the environment . </s>
we can continue to close our eye to these matter . </s>
as I have say , we have both the knowledge and the resource to cope with these issue . </s>
after the first reading in the European Parliament in @card@ , the Commission 's proposal end up in an awkward political situation in the Council . </s>
however , we obtain a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency . </s>
now , we must ensure that the present legislative process be conclude successfully . </s>
a total of @card@ amendment have be table . </s>
the Commission can adopt @card@ amendment in their entirety . </s>
Three amendment can be partially approve , and one can be approve in principle . </s>
certain amendment concern improvement to the Commission 's proposal which we adopt as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such part of the original proposal as the Council have remove . </s>
this apply to Amendment No 5 , exclude section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; @card@ and @card@ , section 3 ; @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
these amendment can all be approve . </s>
amendment Nos 6 and @card@ be new ; the Commission can approve these . </s>
the Commission can also approve Amendment no @card@ with certain editorial change . </s>
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendment affect the proposal 's basic component involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aim at by the common position . </s>
they can therefore be approve . </s>
Parliament have traditionally make a major contribution to strengthen environmental legislation in Europe . </s>
it would amaze and depress me if it be not to do so today . </s>
I be very concern about certain amendment from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillar of the present proposal into question . </s>
these concern , for example , the phasing-out of heavy metal , manufacturer 's liability and the requirement for recycling . </s>
I want to deal with these amendment on a group-by-group basis . </s>
amendment Nos 4 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ concern the phasing-out of heavy metal . </s>
amendment no @card@ involve a delay of at least ten year in bring the provision into force . </s>
amendment Nos @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ involve introduce unnecessary condition and exception . </s>
this would mean that the process of replace dangerous substance would be implement more slowly . </s>
amendment Nos 4 , @card@ and @card@ mean that heavy metal have to be separate from the waste before recycling . </s>
the Commission consider that the type of phasing-out propose in the common position be easy to apply from a technical point of view . </s>
amendment Nos @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ relate to the manufacturer 's liability . </s>
the compromise reach by the Council be fair but fragile . </s>
the Commission do not consider that the amendment would improve the balance without , at the same time , create tension . </s>
I regret the confusion which arise recently due to internal document from the commission be wrongly use , so create uncertainty about the Commission 's attitude to the issue . </s>
I want to emphasise that , as early as @card@ , the Commission propose a special clause concern manufacturer 's liability and that the Commission entirely support the common position . </s>
this do not impose disproportionate cost upon manufacturer . </s>
far from it . </s>
amendment Nos @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ concern quantify objective . </s>
the high level of protection aim at by the common position would be very much undermine if the recycling objective for the year @card@ be remove . </s>
these amendment would also make the objective awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise . </s>
allow me also - listen carefully to what I be say now , because I have hear this reiterate in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and &quot; cherished &quot; car as mention in Amendments Nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and @card@ . </s>
such vehicle be not cover by the definition of waste and be not therefore include under the directive . </s>
so , whatever have be state in this regard , vintage car and motorcycle be not include under the directive . </s>
we do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and @card@ add anything to the directive . </s>
amendment no @card@ involve the Commission be have to adopt quality standard for reusable component . </s>
this be not cover by the directive . </s>
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demand from the European Parliament and the Council . </s>
amendment Nos @card@ , @card@ and @card@ water down the requirement concern the dismantle of vehicle . </s>
There be a danger of Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ reduce the chance of recycling plastic , tyre and glass . </s>
finally , the Commission can approve Amendments Nos 1 and @card@ for reason to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No @card@ , which the Commission consider to be unnecessary at this stage . </s>
furthermore , Amendment no @card@ do not fall within the directive 's area of applicability . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
we shall now proceed to the vote . </s>
vote Madam President , as you know , the reason we be vote this report today rather than last week be because of the numerous and serious translation error , particularly in the French version . </s>
you have receive a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistake in this report and in other report with which I have have dealing recently . </s>
There be an error which have still not be correct and that be on Amendment No 4 . </s>
in the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisation . </s>
in the French version that become ' entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisation scientifiques ' . </s>
Could you please make sure that French-speaking member of this House know that the word entreprises be not correct . </s>
it should not be in the amendment . </s>
and , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we be receive currently . </s>
Madame McNally , in general , I be myself rather concerned at the increase number of problem we be have with the translation . </s>
I shall consult the parliamentary service to see how we can find a solution . </s>

in response I shall say the same thing I say to Mrs McNally just now . </s>
I be very concern about these translation problem which , unfortunately , we seem to be have increasingly , and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed . </s>

&quot; ( more than twelve member of Parliament rise to their foot ) ( Parliament adopt the resolution ) explanation of Vote McNally Report ( A5-0082 / @card@ ) - ( FR ) I be please to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitle ' Women and Science ' . </s>
in this document , the Commission propose to stimulate debate with a view to promote the increase participation of woman in research in Europe . </s>
this objective deserve our total support . </s>
expenditure on research and technology actually form a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union , after agriculture and the structural fund . </s>
the various framework programme have enable not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researcher in various Member States . </s>
relatively few woman , however , be active in scientific discipline despite the excellent result they achieve in their study . </s>
it be unacceptable for woman to continue to be underrepresent . </s>
I be therefore delighted to see the proposal of the European Commission . </s>
the Commission document set out to focus on the initiative to be take at Community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which be quite obviously something I approve of . </s>
the goal for the year to come be to increase woman 's participation to achieve a rate of @card@ % female participation in the Marie Curie grant , in consultative assembly and in evaluation panel for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development . </s>
in order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States , to set up a coordinate body to implement a ' Women and Science ' monitor system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , specially responsible for gather and disseminate statistic collect in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regard the rate of woman 's participation in research activity . </s>
furthermore , like the rapporteur , I think that study must be undertake to analyse the reason for the gap between the number of woman with science degree and the number of woman who manage to have a career in these field . </s>
improve analysis of the obstacle face woman will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacle . </s>
we will have to enlist the support of the many existing network of woman scientist and to obtain their assistance in frame a joint research policy . </s>
the European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regard the promotion of woman and to come up with idea for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development . </s>
we must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other European Union policy , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevent woman compete on equal term in the labour market . </s>
in its communication &quot; Women and Science &quot; , the European Commission inform us of its good intention of enlist the support of woman to enrich research in Europe . </s>
this be very good , and we be please to see it . </s>
the fact be there be too few woman involve in research work in the European Union . </s>
we know that we can change this situation , in which woman be underrepresent in the science sector , only by mean of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a great range of career choice for girl and , when they have obtain their degree , by mean of positive measure at the professional level . </s>
have say this , some of our fellow member clearly have qualm because the report by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal opportunity which we have vote on contain one point which may lead to confusion and be interpret by some as a quota stipulate that there must be @card@ % female participate in research in Europe . </s>
this be patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic . </s>
indeed the report do not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieve . </s>
To set my fellow member ' mind at ease and to reassure them , I have table an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission , in its communication , undertake to make significant effort to increase woman 's participation in Community research programme , which be , after all , a praiseworthy goal . </s>
and why should we not note that the Commission 's communication stipulate specifically that it consider a @card@ % minimum level to be a crucial goal for woman 's participation at all level in the implementation and management of research programme ? </s>
it be not a quota ! </s>
it be a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission , insofar as it concern its own programme and not those of Member States . </s>
the latter would be well advise , however , to follow the good example of the Commission , for once , and make the same effort in their own research programme . </s>
people must realise this ! </s>
I be please to see that the debate on Mrs McNally 's report with a view to increase and facilitate woman 's participation in profession in research and science , meet with a fairly wide consensus . </s>
on this subject , any improvement in bring the concept of equal opportunity to bear in everyday reality be indeed desirable , and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfy the legitimate aspiration of woman : to enjoy equal access to scientific study , to obtain position of responsibility truly in line with their result and competence , and to have accompanying measure draw up rapidly , enable them to reconcile their family life and their career . </s>
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associate with the elimination of the practical obstacle identify as unquestionable factor in this inequality must , as far as we be concern , necessarily be base on the idea of complementarity , which be the only one capable of justify a proactive policy on the subject . </s>
our thinking and our future action must focus on respect these value , which truly respect gender difference , not on some postulate sexual equality , which have its own intrinsic contradiction . </s>
in any event there be no ground for resort to the easy option of a quantitative policy , base on the use of quota , contrary to the idea of citizenship which the member of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by , and whose probable consequence would be the opposite of the effect apparently seek by Mrs McNally 's report , namely woman 's participation in career in science and research in proportion with their merit . </s>
by have the opportunity to show their true merit , by eliminate as far as possible the barrier associate to the specific of their condition as woman , and not in the context of a conflict in which woman seem to be attack male privilege , woman will demonstrate the benefit to be gain by facilitate a situation where their professional career may flourish . </s>
in this way they will succeed in alter balance which be still not in their favour . </s>
since the European Parliament choose to vote on a text that expressly resort to the quota policy which my report for an opinion have attempt to denounce in no uncertain term , and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part , I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally 's report . </s>
second reading of the Florenz report ( A5-0006 / @card@ ) Madam President , today in the second reading we have vote on the amendment to the directive on end-of-life vehicle . </s>
I have reject the entire directive , not least because Amendment No @card@ to Article @card@ and the amendment to Article 5 / 4 have not receive an adequate majority here in the House . </s>
I come from a country which manufacture @card@ % of the car in the Eu and it be precisely the free collection of end-of-life car which be so financially onerous and unacceptable . </s>
here , in my opinion , the labour market be also considerably burden by the cost arise to these company . </s>
this can be a good thing in a European Union where we be ever mindful of employment . </s>
I consider that this be a serious defect and that , in principle , it do not befit our legal system . </s>
in my opinion , this directive be unacceptable for this reason . </s>
madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report . </s>
I think that the vote have show that although the common position of the Council have be tone down , the major group here ( and above all the German delegate of the major group ) have not , thank God , succeed in destroy the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility . </s>
unfortunately , there have be a tone down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i. e. through the obligatory risk assessment of material whose harmful effect on health have be know for year . </s>
we know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risk and numerous Community directive have succeed in restrict their usage without any risk assessment be make . </s>
here , unfortunately , the European Parliament have bow to the interest of industry . </s>
I be nevertheless extremely please that there be no majority for the amendment of Florenz , Lange and other who have actually seek to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumer solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicle . </s>
I find this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I be please that it fail , that the attempt by one large government and the delegate of a large Member State do not gain a majority , by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on ground of the interest of its national industry . </s>
madam President , although I too have spend most of my life in fast car , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scrap car must make it clear that vintage car be not include . </s>
these splendid car do not constitute waste . </s>
that be why I vote in favour of the amendment . </s>
neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there be very great difference from one country 's statute to another be . </s>
in this way vehicle of historic value can be preserve for future generation . </s>
we can forget old car enthusiast either , of whom there be more than @card@ @card@ in Finland alone . </s>
they be involve in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance . </s>
- ( SV ) the parliamentary process concern this question have be confusing , to say the least . </s>
before the vote at the plenary sit , new amendment have be table such as have already be vote down by the Committee . </s>
in the divide situation which have now arise , we therefore consider that the Council 's wording be the good . </s>
we need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure . </s>
the directive concern end-of-life vehicle will stand as an example for future legislation . </s>
it be therefore important that the manufacturer 's liability should be clear . </s>
this should not in any way be jeopardise . </s>
today , Parliament be examine , for the last time , this text on ' end-of-life ' vehicle and what be to be do with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment . </s>
There be , however , two consideration which must certainly be deal with within this text . </s>
first of all , who be to bear the financial cost of this destruction ? </s>
we must all ensure that it be not always the same person , I. E. the vehicle owner , who pay . </s>
he or she already pay enough in taxis for this vehicle , which be a bottomless pit in financial term . </s>
we have recently have cause to talk about the ' polluter pay ' principle . </s>
we should apply this principle rationally and calmly , correctly target and without ideology . </s>
another essential point that must be include in this text be the express exclusion of vintage vehicle from its scope . </s>
one might make the claim that there be no need to state it explicitly in write because it be an obvious point , but I feel that it be a point that should be make in write because there be every interest in adopt clear text . </s>
so let us vote for these amendment in order to preserve these gem of the automobile industry . </s>
these old vehicle be testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognise and respect by Europe , if we be not to water down each of our specific identity . </s>
There be no lack of example amongst European text , and we all know how much debate and argument be cause by a lack of clarity and precision . </s>
I only need to mention the case of Directives @card@ / @card@ and @card@ / @card@ . </s>
the precise wording of text provide a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these text on a daily basis . </s>
it be not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceeding for judge in any arena . </s>
that would not be fulfill our mission . </s>
on the contrary , we must adopt crystal-clear text in order to limit legal dispute . </s>
. </s>
( NL ) that the Florenz report have cause such a stir have be prove by the powerful lobby machine which have be set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement . </s>
I regret that the manufacturer have harangue the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of argument which either cut no ice or be simply false . </s>
I dare say this because I take the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among other , scrapyards which already recycle car component successfully . </s>
they make it clear to me that the argument concern lack of safety , for example , be nonsense . </s>
the car lobby be unsuccessful today and I be please about that . </s>
the directive remain in place . </s>
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the effort to achieve a good living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirement . </s>
- my party oppose this measure and the propose amendment . </s>
There be few thing more certain in life than taxis , death and pollution . </s>
however , there be also nothing more certain than Eu environmental directive which have laudable intention but which actually fail to achieve their stated objective . </s>
when it come to pollution , like sin , we be all against it , but from there it be a far cry from believe that just because a measure be propose against this evil it be necessarily good . </s>
in fact , this directive , like so many other address environmental issue , be not good . </s>
as be so often the case , it merely provide yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more job for official , and cost the motor industry and consumer a great deal of money . </s>
the one thing it will not do be solve the problem - it be a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut . </s>
no one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encourage , but the good way to achieve that be to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity . </s>
thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling be to tax manufacturer who do not increase the amount of recoverable material in their vehicle , to encourage private sector recycling company , through a package of tax incentive and assistance on comply with environmental requirement , and to incentivise the use of recycled material . </s>
of course , these be area where the Eu do not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction . </s>
however , in the absence of these power , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure . </s>
instead , it should leave Member States to develop their own system , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it be not want and can do no good . </s>
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / @card@ ) this proposal for a directive attempt to establish condition for the post of worker who be third-country national , for the provision of cross-border service . </s>
third-country national with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union . </s>
until now , the restriction on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community worker have be very harsh . </s>
it be therefore a positive step that the movement of worker within the European Union be be make easy , even when they be national of third country . </s>
nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aim to allow them to move to another Member State when they be post there by an employer base in their country of normal residence . </s>
this mean that their scope for movement be limit to the duration of their post and only to the Member state to which they be post . </s>
this mean that this proposal 's fundamental aim be not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these worker , but merely to improve the position of the company provide service . </s>
on the other hand , for the sake of simplify procedure some highly debatable amendment have be include in the Berger report , one example of which be the establishment of a common information service for card issue by a body in any Member State . </s>
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / @card@ ) and Berger Report ( A5-0012 / @card@ ) it be with the great satisfaction that I welcome the two proposal for directive intend to facilitate the freedom of movement of worker who be national of a third country while facilitate the freedom of movement of service . </s>
basically , these proposal introduce the Eu service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country national legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide service in other Member States , a phenomenon currently obstruct by problem such as the need to obtain visa and work permit . </s>
the first proposal for a directive will authorise business establish in a Member State which employ worker who be third country national to assign such employee to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide service there . </s>
accord to the term of the directive , the employer would be simply require to request a service provision card for each employee concern . </s>
logically , in order to be give such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be cover by a social security scheme . </s>
the second proposal grant the same right to self-employed worker who be third country national . </s>
while , basically , I subscribe to the European Commission proposal , nonetheless there be some condition which may lead to confusion . </s>
that be why I be vote in favour of the amendment table by the rapporteur . </s>
this will make it possible to clarify the term and thus prevent any misread ! </s>
other amendment be intend to simplify the administrative procedure , for example by authorise Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issue card . </s>
I feel an amendment of this type be essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often act as a brake on the proper application of new condition . </s>
I can , therefore , only be delight at the adoption of these directive thus amend . </s>
we could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union have to face so many problem . </s>
this go against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrine in the founding treaty of this Union . </s>
Marinho Report ( A5-0003 / @card@ ) : we have serious reservation about the Council 's propose amendment . </s>
How can we talk of increase the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judge in that Court because it be overstretched ? </s>
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effect of the latter . </s>
some people will say that perfection be not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservation more understandable to them : on 1 January @card@ , the Council go back on the decision to increase the number of judge lay down in Article @card@ of the Accession Treaty of @card@ June @card@ . </s>
in May @card@ , during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the CFI , concern about the persistent increase in the volume of case , be already insist on the need to take measure ' without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assign role ... in condition likely to compromise the protection of party subject to trial . </s>
' so what be do at Amsterdam ? </s>
in that respect , nothing . </s>
on the contrary , extend the Community 's legal competence within the framework of the third pillar have increase the burden . </s>
you will agree , furthermore , that the text adopt by this House always call for Community jurisdiction , and that include for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which be currently be draw up . </s>
the increase in the number of CFI judge from @card@ to @card@ and the opportunity it have recently be accord to have a single judge rule on specific case be not real solution but mere decoy , grudgingly grant , which we have become aware of after the fact . </s>
consequently , these proposal do not live up to the issue at stake . </s>
they represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judge to be increase to several hundred . </s>
we can agree to this , since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges be detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our state . </s>
the time have come , we feel , for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice . </s>
this question can be deal with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norm and the good application of the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ? </s>
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report ( A5-0018 / @card@ ) - ( SV ) the most important task of the approach Intergovernmental Conference be to reform the Eu before the accession of the new Member States . </s>
we therefore , of course , support the European Parliament be now give the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limit to question which have to be resolve if it be to be possible for enlargement to take place . </s>
we also argue this in November @card@ , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of @card@ November @card@ . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) in the opinion which it have just adopt on the convene of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament call for a &quot; constitutional process to be launch &quot; . </s>
this determination to override nation with a legally supranational text be also express in the first meeting of the body responsible for draw up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights , which be really a closet constitution . </s>
it be express again in the unbelievable excess perpetrate by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wish to cancel out the result of the free election in Austria . </s>
the same determination to reduce nation to the level of mere administrative region be also evident on every page of the opinion issue by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the key idea involve make qualified majority vote the general rule while modify the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of state and people , in order to increase the Commission 's room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority state . </s>
incidentally , the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission be ask for Article @card@ of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amend in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament . </s>
people will remember that this article , deal with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level , stipulate that for five year decision would still be take by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system . </s>
in France , both in the National Assembly and in the Senate , when this be be ratify , many member of the French parliament be reassure to hear that , in any case , the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making . </s>
well , today , the same Minister of European Affairs who draw up the Treaty of Amsterdam , who have , in the meantime , become a European Commissioner , Mr Barnier , propose to decide , at the forthcoming IGC , that the Council will operate in these area by majority decision . </s>
this be the type of mechanism we be continually subject to when play the game of European integration with the Brussels institution . </s>
the French must be make aware not only that the purpose of all these operation be to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision make , but that furthermore every mean will be use to extract their consent . </s>
if they yield , they be lose . </s>
for it be their very mean of defence which be be eliminate one by one . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the Danish Social Democrats have today vote against the report on the convene of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
it be crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be conclude before the end of the year @card@ so that there be no remain formality , such as the weighting of vote in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament , which place obstacle in the way of the enlargement of the Eu . </s>
we be therefore also very satisfy with the decision which be take on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December . </s>
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delay the enlargement process . </s>
that be something we do not want to see , and we have therefore vote against any such extension . </s>
we nonetheless very much agree with our colleague that there be a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people be clear as to how the work be proceed . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) we be please that a limited agenda have be establish for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference . </s>
possible future Member States ought to be involve in , and have an influence upon , the shape of the Eu of the future . </s>
the election to the European Parliament in @card@ show perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist Eu centre upon Brussels . </s>
with the convene of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union be topical once again . </s>
once again the discussion be go to be monopolise by the Heads of State and Government . </s>
in other word , fifteen people be go to have discussion and decide , behind closed door , on the fate of more than @card@ million individual . </s>
it be therefore easy to understand the public 's lack of interest , give the construction of Europe which be go on behind their back and in area which be not really of concern to them . </s>
in fact , one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institution , enlargement and European defence . </s>
the fact be that the prime concern be the strengthening of executive power , the development of close relation with liberalism in the country of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe , particularly by increase military budget . </s>
Social Europe , use as a foil by the Eu , have simply be eliminate from the agenda . </s>
All this do be to legitimise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movement anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise worker ' main claim towards the high common denominator . </s>
this be why I be vote against the report . </s>
I vote for the resolution to adopt an opinion be in favour of convene the IGC . </s>
I do so because it sum up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency , which be support by a broad majority in Parliament , of open up the IGC agenda beyond issue strictly relate to redress the balance of power between Member States , large and small , as be originally state when the Helsinki Council be convene . </s>
unfortunately , in the issue cover by the resolution on future subject for revision to the Treaty on European Union , nothing have so far be state about the need to review Article 7 , which deal with suspend a state in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the &quot; founding &quot; principle of the Union , as lay down in Article 6 . </s>
as the present crisis involve Austria have demonstrate , the Union have the right to protect itself . </s>
nevertheless , the legal mechanism that exist in the Treaty be weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the power of the institution and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for process of major importance . </s>
suspend a state be just such a process , and be to be condemn . </s>
I therefore think that this issue should be include as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justify a thorough revision of the treaty . </s>
we feel that at present the central issue about convene an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the treaty be far more important than the controversy take place here about the size of the agenda . </s>
they be also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulate proposal for new issue to be cover , and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament 's participation in it . </s>
we feel that these issue result from the IGC 's appropriateness and its objective , as well as from the matter which will inevitably be discuss there . </s>
we have doubt concern the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objective actually be address may be far remove from the change require to allow for the enlargement envisage . </s>
this relate in particular to the intended agenda , particularly as regard the Amsterdam leftover , which suggest that unacceptable inner cabinet will be create in the future . </s>
this also identify area relate to the second and third pillar , which tend to be reflect in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union . </s>
these be some of the basic reason why we do not agree with the aim of the motion for a resolution now before us . </s>
- the European Parliamentary Labour Party have abstain on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report . </s>
the text be overambitious , and Britain 's Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the &quot; Amsterdam left-overs &quot; in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these . </s>
There be currently a great deal of work under way in term of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthen of the Eu institution . </s>
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaty would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation . </s>
the key factor in this text as it have be amend , be the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporate into the treaty . </s>
in our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explain to citizen what their existing right be . </s>
our priority ( i. e. the &quot; left-overs &quot; ) must be : the number and responsibility of Commissioners weighting of vote in the Council extension of QMV in area where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matter , border control or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV be extend beyond this , we have concern that the &quot; flexibility &quot; or enhanced cooperation suggestion be not appropriate at present . </s>
the provision of Amsterdam be largely untested and allow more scope for opt-outs could weaken the Eu at the time when enlargement be be consider and applicant country be be ask to sign up to single market and other European legislation . </s>
- ( SV ) in order to be able to influence development , the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental conference than emerge from the present resolution , which display far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European council make in Helsinki in December @card@ . </s>
the European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have be more specific and concentrate on just a few point in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki , so state what it consider to be the most pressing matter for discussion , include the question of establish a public prosecutor to deal with crime against the institution of the European Union and their financial interest . </s>
we Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threat which have be make to delay the enlargement of the Eu to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference be not extend very considerably to include subject in addition to those leave over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in @card@ . </s>
the most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference be to reform the Eu before the accession of the new Member States . </s>
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament be now give the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limit to question which have to be resolve if it be to be possible for the enlargement to take place . </s>
I also refer to my explanation of vote of @card@ November @card@ which clarify my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence . </s>
joint resolution on Austria Madam President , the Union for a Europe of Nations Group do not associate itself with the joint PPE / DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria follow the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservative and Jörg Haider 's Freedom Party . </s>
this PPE / DE-PSE resolution commend the initiative take by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organise a sort of diplomatic boycott . </s>
What we find most shocking be the fact that this joint intervention claim the authority of the Treaty , as if this state somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancel by the will of the head of government of neighbour country who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrain from consult their own people . </s>
whatever Jörg Haider 's verbal excess , which we of course deplore , the Austrian have make a democratic choice , and we must respect this . </s>
in our opinion , it be clear that the leave wing in the European Parliament , in association with the Austrian left wing which be defeat in the electoral arena , have mount a petty political campaign resort to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period . </s>
although compare Haider to Hitler be a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it have nonetheless partly achieve its purpose in unsettling some PPE / DE member of Parliament . </s>
but , go beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the European Parliament be afraid of most of all be that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria , which cause political life to stagnate and rot , may soon spread to the European system of co-management which be produce equally appalling result . </s>
in order to prevent this threat to the system , it be ready to do anything , include overrule the outcome of free election , include set up a thought police , include establish a new form of totalitarianism . </s>
madam President , on behalf of the member of Parliament who represent the Front national , the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale Italiano , I should like to ask the question : in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affair which the European Union have undertake in contravention of general international law , in contravention of the treaty , in contravention of morality , who be pull the string ? </s>
be this hysteria spontaneous ? </s>
be it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which be the same throughout the world ? </s>
who be impose their will on the nation of Europe , daring to stop them choose their own fate ? </s>
underground network ? </s>
the government of the United States , or of Israel ? </s>
or their socialist back-up troop who , in this House , have the cheek to thrust their value down our throat ? </s>
What , then , be the value of these Socialists who feather their electoral nest in the last century by paint the idea of great social justice in glowing colour for the benefit of the underprivileged , and who today be nothing more than the party of protect civil servant , full-time union official and state capitalism ? </s>
What be the value of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only go from paedophilia scandal to corruption scandal , via Vandam and Agusta ? </s>
What be the value of the French Socialist Party , which extort money from all the town council under its thumb in the Urba , Sages and Graco scandal ? </s>
the party lead by François Mitterrand , decorate with the emblem of Marshal Pétain 's Vichy government , the party whose lead light have just be catch red-handed once again , live a life of luxury on the public fund embezzle from the student ' mutual insurance company . </s>
I shall not even mention the instance of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party , because it do not do to kick a man when he be down , still less when he be dead and go . </s>
I shall , however , mention the Spanish Socialist Party which have just form an alliance with the butcher of Albacete and which settle its account with Basque nationalist by hire contract killer . </s>
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dare to preach to us about the second world war , when it be international socialist in the way that its peer be National Socialists , still goose-stepping , the party of the Waffen SS ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Madam President , I have a major problem with this resolution . </s>
finally , I abstain on the vote for a number of reason . </s>
I be in sympathy with the Edd Group amendment , talk about reject the interference of the Eu in the formation of government of Members States but I have to abstain because it just follow on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc. and I feel that it might be misinterpret . </s>
however , I do wonder about the wisdom of this . </s>
firstly , there be the question of try to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequence of that . </s>
I also wonder about the wisdom of the Eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that be go to affect public opinion there . </s>
at the moment it seem that the Haider Party be get more support rather than less from the opposition by outside government . </s>
even America have now say that it be consider break off diplomatic relation . </s>
we wonder if this be actually feed the flame of xenophobia and the party and people that support it . </s>
I really think that people should be extremely cautious . </s>
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root cause . </s>
we need to look at the people who vote for these party , and understand why this situation arise . </s>
it be not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we be try to achieve . </s>
madam President , I strongly refute any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism . </s>
I passionately defend Europe 's heritage of human right and the rule of law . </s>
I disagree , however , for this very reason , with the senseless action take by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have result in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen state . </s>
this be not the way to fight extremism . </s>
it may even be a way of do extremism a great deal of good . </s>
the torrent of confusion and rash action that have be unleash over Austria have blow thing out of all proportion . </s>
it have cause considerable distress to decent citizen and evoke risk that have previously not even be consider . </s>
There be an irreconcilable contradiction between position adopt in the name of human right and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental right of the Austrian and ride roughshod over the basic tenet of the rule of law , in this case the standard lay down in the treaty . </s>
What be we actually seek to achieve in embark on an Intergovernmental Conference ? </s>
a Europe of @card@ States or a Europe of @card@ , or even few ? </s>
we support Europe , a Europe which do honour to all the action that have bring us to this point , a Europe which respect the treaty and the law and a Europe which need Austria . </s>
this need to be say ! </s>
madam President , I be delighted and proud that this Parliament have , by an enormous majority , condemn the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporate Mr Haider 's Freedom Party . </s>
Mr Haider have demonstrate , over the past year by both word and deed , that he deserve to be exclude from normal democratic discourse . </s>
not only have he admire Adolf Hitler , praise the Waffen SS , and refuse to condemn a terrorist bombing that kill four Roma , but also in Carinthia have be a member of the regional government . </s>
he have lead effort to end provision for Austria 's Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrant . </s>
some have say it be not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics . </s>
they be wrong . </s>
European Union treaty make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental right . </s>
some have say we have to accept the result of democratic election . </s>
however , democratic election do not make democrat of those who have threaten democracy . </s>
There be the tragic monument of the Holocaust , the death of 6 million Jews , to those who argue the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s . </s>
however , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition . </s>
leopard do not change their spot . </s>
the real culprit be Austria 's Christian Democrat act as Judas goat to resurrect a threat to Europe that we think have die Berlin in @card@ . </s>
madam President , we have just pass a resolution which condemn the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider 's Freedom Party in Austria , which have welcome action by our government to cut off political relation with any government of which he be part , and which send our support to anti-racist group within the democratic majority of the Austrian people . </s>
we warn that this coalition , if it be form today , unacceptably legitimise the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principle of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this European Union . </s>
these be the value which we ask of other who seek to join us . </s>
this European Parliament require the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threaten to suspend Austria from membership of the European union if this happen . </s>
I be proud to support such a resolution . </s>
though our proposal to withdraw political invitation to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament have not carry today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the power of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be take . </s>
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President . </s>
I respect Parliament 's wish , as it have be express , but I must also say that the self-determination of people can be call into question , even by the European Parliament . </s>
the document be unfair both to Austrian member of the European Parliament , and to member of the Austrian national parliament , and it smack slightly of jealousy and political interest , but also of business . </s>
I do not believe that these signal will change the citizen ' indifference to Europe . </s>
the Austrian extreme right have be gifted an unwarranted present . </s>
I very much welcome the position take by the Italian Radicals ; and I say this while make a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberal and Austrian liberal . </s>
I have for many year , in word and deed , be commit to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggle for equal right and against xenophobia . </s>
however , recent event - firstly , what be really threat by the Council of Ministers , then Mr Prodi 's threat against the Austrian Commissioner and , finally , the present decision - be thing I can support . </s>
I have not be able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premise . </s>
What we have here , first and foremost , be an incredibly ominous mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union . </s>
not only do these decision conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institution of the Union more power than that to which they be entitle but , bad of all , their effect will be counter-productive . </s>
they will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ . </s>
on the contrary , they will strengthen them . </s>
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want . </s>
that be not how you combat racism and a swing to the right . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the Left 's member of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today 's decision , Parliament have NOT support the fourteen prime minister ' diplomatic sanction against Austria . </s>
the Left 's member of Parliament therefore support the liberal decision 's powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere . </s>
we attach crucial importance to apply , if necessary , the new provision under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which , by its action , infringe fundamental citizen ' right by mean of discrimination and such like will have its voting right in the Eu 's Council of Ministers remove . </s>
- ( el ) the Freedom Party 's participation in the Austrian government be a dangerous development for the European Union 's political future . </s>
it be a ' Trojan horse ' which be unfortunately reappear in Europe large than ever since the Second World War . </s>
the European Parliament and the Union 's government must politically isolate a government that include admirer of Nazism and advocate of xenophobia . </s>
the European Union bear a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movement , the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because , by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policy of EMU , their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition , they have push broad stratum of society to the limit and make it possible for right-wing extremist of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi way . </s>
in view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemn Haider 's party , as well as all the party throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which be xenophobic and hostile to immigrant worker , we vote in favour of the compromise resolution . </s>
we do so even though we do not agree with some of its recital or term , in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who be oppose the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery . </s>
our vote in no way constitute an endorsement of the signatory to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious . </s>
some of these party , despite declare themselves to be republican and democratic , adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right , either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy , if only in openly and hypocritically blame the immigrant worker in our country for unemployment , and generally make their life more difficult . </s>
more generally , those signatory who take part in or have take part in government in the various state of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right have manage to gain since their policy , devote exclusively to the interest of big business , have not include take action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engender , and have thus facilitate the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right . </s>
this week we hear the first political cry of the new-born Europe . </s>
by staunchly and speedily denounce the participation of Jörg Haider 's xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the European Union have come into its political birthright and have confirm that it be not merely an economic and financial Community , a large market , a &quot; Europe of shopkeeper &quot; . </s>
it be a part of its future which be at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul . </s>
the European Parliament be the first to speak up . </s>
the appeal by the European socialist , on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel , raise awareness and enable there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation . </s>
a firm attitude which the @card@ European States have demonstrate unanimously and promptly , through Mr Guterres , by condemn the risk of the Austrian political situation get out of control . </s>
this courageous stance turn a new page in the construction of Europe . </s>
a return to the root , at last , for a community build on the basis of the determination to turn our back on a past history mar by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist value of openness and tolerance . </s>
Europe have manage to stand up to condemn unacceptable event . </s>
however , as it lack the legal instrument to support this political will , since the sanction stipulate under Article 7 of the treaty be virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic block of its entire institutional structure ? </s>
the whole credibility of Europe be at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracy of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow . </s>
from now on Europe must put its word into action if it wish to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition . </s>
at this time when we be vote on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State , I must express my regret regard a compromise text which be particularly lack in backbone . </s>
I be vote in favour of it because it be inconceivable that the European Parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter . </s>
personally , however , I shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measure which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p. m. fascism and neo-Nazism be cancer ! </s>
the foul monster have be reawaken ! </s>
for me there be no question of allow them to develop and to flourish without fight with all our might . </s>
Europe be bear out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance . </s>
There be no question of it allow xenophobic , racist and anti-Semitic minister to be tolerate at within it . </s>
do not count on me to keep quiet , without do or say anything . </s>
in yesterday 's debate in the European Parliament some member of this Parliament express worry that we be interfere in the internal affair of a Member State . </s>
such a concern be misplace . </s>
the European Parliament have never be slow to comment on development in Member States with which they disagree . </s>
we have condemn Basque and Irish terrorism . </s>
we have oppose racism and the infringement of the right of minority . </s>
it be our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elect voice of the European Union , to comment on current political development in Austria which be in conflict with the policy of this parliament . </s>
by comment and make our view know we be not prevent any party in Austria from form a coalition government . </s>
we be nonetheless , as be our right as well as our responsibility , tell them that if they go ahead then there be consequence arise from such a decision and in fact we be warn them beforehand . </s>
other would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement . </s>
such a view be not only a political cop-out , it be positively dangerous . </s>
in reach an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirm political respectability on right wing extremism and also give them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launch pad for even great electoral success . </s>
that be why the European Union must make its position clear regard the current situation in Austria . </s>
- ( SV ) we have vote in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who be expose to xenophobia and racism . </s>
we have also vote in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stand for . </s>
we be nonetheless very critical of the method which the @card@ Member States have employ on this issue . </s>
the resolution make no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national identity and constitutional tradition in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty . </s>
What be also miss be a paragraph concern the Eu 's share responsibility for the social and political development in Europe and Austria which have be among the prior condition for Mr Haider 's electoral success . </s>
today , as previously in the history of Europe , right-wing extremism be the result of insecure social and economic condition of life . </s>
the policy of cut-backs which have follow in the wake of adjust to EMU have promote the success of right-wing extremism . </s>
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country be the good guarantee of democratic development in Europe . </s>
- ( de ) I be make this statement on behalf of the CSU . </s>
it be intolerable that the Eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State . </s>
it have no right to do so . </s>
instead of prematurely condemn the FPÖ and the Austrian government which be be form , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policy of the coalition . </s>
only after such critical appraisal of the future policy of the party involve in the coalition discussion can a decision be make as to whether this government be contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe . </s>
this do not mean that we sympathise with Haider . </s>
the CSU European delegate have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ . </s>
however , as politician we must ask the question why @card@ % of the Austrian population vote for a party such as the FPÖ at the election in October @card@ . </s>
we must concern ourselves with the reason for this and try to deal with the reason behind such result . </s>
only by tackle the argument and policy of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics . </s>
however , the resolution of the European Parliament do not question the reason for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offer no option for resolve the problem . </s>
for these reason the CSU European delegate be against this resolution . </s>
we be extremely concern to witness this upsurge in the force of the far right in Europe , especially in Austria , Germany , France , Belgium and Italy . </s>
it be crucial that we should discuss the underlie cause of this and that we should adopt measure to combat them . </s>
an increase in social inequality , unemployment and the problem of poverty and social exclusion create suspicion amongst the general public and condition which favour far-right populism . </s>
in view of this , it be vital that the European institution should adopt the measure necessary to prevent the rise of racist and xenophobic ideology . </s>
this require a sea change in the socio-economic policy of neo-liberal capitalism and that priority be give to create quality job which give right to employee . </s>
this also require policy which strengthen participatory democracy and which educate the general public , particularly about the value of democracy and solidarity . </s>
just as we condemn and repudiate the idea and action of the far right , we also wish to express our solidarity with the Austrian people . </s>
we support all force fight for great democracy and against racism and xenophobia . </s>

&quot; it be with these phrase that Albert Camus , at the close of the long allegorical novel describe the difficult fight of the citizen of the town of Oran against the plague , remind us , at the close of the Second World War , that the fight against Nazism , &quot; the brown plague &quot; as it be term at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory . </s>
that because racial hatred , xenophobic violence , fear and rejection of what be different , have deep root in all that be base in humanity , they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human being . </s>
in this light , the event we be see in Austria must be see as tragic . </s>
for the first time since the Second World War , a party which be openly pro-Nazi , racist and xenophobic have gain access to power in a European country . </s>
confront with this threat , which carry with it the negation of the very idea which lie at the heart of the construction of Europe , nothing must deter us : not the legal quibbling about what the treaty do or do not permit , not the legitimate question about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grip us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our conviction but which we be powerless to control . </s>
as the representative for a French overseas department , the island of Réunion , a land of racial and ethnic intermix , where the population have be forge in the course of the last three century by the successive contribution of Europeans , blacks from Africa or Madagascar , enlist man from India or Pakistan , or even Chinese , every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry , &quot; in be different to me , you be not do me harm , brother , but enrich me ! </s>
&quot; this human diversity be our main source of wealth , and this be the reason why it be my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist . </s>
for all these reason I vote most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria . </s>
Jörg Haider 's rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government , be a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism have give birth . </s>
the success of the Austrian Freedom Party owe as much to the endorsement of respectability provide by the Austrian right wing and social democrat as to the policy of the latter , whose social disaster pave the way for extreme right-wing populism . </s>
the resolution stipulate possible diplomatic mean to isolate the new government politically without even mention the root cause of the resurgence of fascism . </s>
it can be explain by the feeling of helplessness of the people who be the victim of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling class to promote strong government in order to take their policy of austerity and deregulation ever further . </s>
in order to oppose the xenophobic statement of an apprentice dictator who be nostalgic for the Third Reich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrian oppose to fascism . </s>
this be why we be vote in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical reference to a ' European democratic model ' which bear more resemblance to a fortress which track down , expel and imprison immigrant without the proper paper , when it be not open file on teenager . </s>
- ( de ) I have just vote against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government be form between the ÖVP and the FPÖ . </s>
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as &quot; Europe 's scapegoat &quot; ( or even bad , neo-Nazi and Super Racist ) to be counterproductive . </s>
of course I , in no way , agree with the publicise statement of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplay of the Hitler regime . </s>
however , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the event in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherent . </s>
the Eu must not do him an invaluable PR service . </s>
the strength of the FPÖ can be trace back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialist must bear the main responsibility . </s>
it be only after they unsuccessfully solicit the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and , obviously in vain , offer the Freedom Party ministerial post , that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider . </s>
it turn its threaten loss of power into an &quot; heroic battle for the preservation of value &quot; and an imminent , pure-and-simple &quot; decision between democracy and non-democracy &quot; . </s>
this be a smear on the voter in my neighbour country which I can condone . </s>
we German Christian Democrats use another strategy in the battle against extremist and clearly disassociate ourselves from them . </s>
we reveal the hollowness of the republican who be nationalistic , xenophobic and anti-minority . </s>
today the republican be no longer represent in most local parliament . </s>
the German approach be no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again . </s>
it can be copy arbitrarily since each Member State have its own specific condition . </s>
the ÖVP ( Austrian People 's Party ) , whose presence at European level we have also come to take for grant , be daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria . </s>
it can only succeed if agreement be make which be solidly base on compliance with democratic principle . </s>
the Council have become prematurely involve without wait for the result of the coalition negotiation or a programme of government . </s>
this condemnation be as unacceptable as the threaten break off of official contact with the Austrian Republic . </s>
sound democracy mean be alert and not blind in one eye . </s>
we must take up a reason offensive against radical on both the right and the left . </s>
I would have like to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialist be prepare to make common cause with the successor to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR . </s>
in the meantime , they have be form government in German federal state . </s>
I fully support the statement make by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session . </s>
he speak of the task of not isolate Member States but of do everything to unite them in common European value . </s>
- ( FR ) I vote against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria . </s>
Austria be a free , independent and sovereign country . </s>
consequently , neither the Council , the Commission nor the European Parliament have the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State . </s>
the Austrian election be hold in a free , proper and democratic manner . </s>
any interference by the European institution in this country be therefore unacceptable ; it be in violation of the European Treaty ( Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam ) . </s>
nevertheless , these same institution show no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union , despite its well-known human right violation . </s>
nothing of this nature have yet occur in Austria . </s>
this precedent , create on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency , be a worry one as far as the future of the European Union be concern . </s>
on the one hand , the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrate the worrying influence of conformist thought . </s>
on the other hand , if tomorrow the government of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational body , then the very principle of democracy will be destroy . </s>
in such circumstance will it even be worth have election ? </s>
this be not the way to create the condition for the nation of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a share future . </s>
I be vote against this motion for a joint resolution on the result of the national election in Austria and on the proposal for a coalition government between the Austrian People 's Party and the Freedom Party for three reason . </s>
first of all because the separate vote that we request have not be adopt . </s>
nor have certain amendment , which take together would make the text more consistent and meaningful . </s>
secondly , because the resolution that have just be adopt be self-contradictory : on the one hand , in recital D , it recognise that the Eu and its institution ' insistence on promote and defend European democratic value imply that it recognise the integrity of the democratic right and constitutional prerogative of the Austrian state and people . </s>
on the other hand , it take the liberty of agree , and even congratulate itself in paragraph 4 , on the political intent of the statement by the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
To our mind , this be nothing more than a hurried , ill-considered and illegal interference in the result of the free exercise by the Austrian state and people of their democratic right and of their constitutional prerogative . </s>
this be how we view the matter and this be the third reason for our vote , because the result of the free and democratic exercise of the Austrian people 's right to vote be not be consider or respect . </s>
at least they should not be prejudge , which be what be happen here . </s>
in fact , this resolution and all similar statement do not show the slight consideration for the will express by the electorate of a Member State of the European Union . </s>
in addition to this , we be oppose - in the name of tolerance , funnily enough - the formation of the government which this result make possible . </s>
nor be we allow it to prove the intention and political idea that it have repeatedly state , in the face of the accusation to which it be be subject . </s>
this resolution still allow the position of those we seek to condemn to be strengthen as a result of this manipulation and victimisation , and I regard this as foolish . </s>
ultimately , this set a very dangerous precedent within the EU itself which can only lead to further undermine the climate of confidence and mutual respect that must exist between nation and citizen who want to pursue a common path , in a spirit of equality and respect for national sovereignty . </s>
this even apply to those who , like us , be pole apart from the racist and xenophobic view which seem to be spread across Europe , but who prefer to oppose them by decisively attack their root cause . </s>
- ( FR ) the vote which have just take place in this Chamber be a historic one for it be the first time we have ever debate the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety . </s>
I believe there be circumstance when the question of principle and institutional regulation be obliterate . </s>
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental value of the Union . </s>
I urge the Commission to be less cautious . </s>
in this resolution , Parliament be assume its responsibility . </s>
have say that , in my opinion , the resolution adopt today be the absolute minimum , the very least we could do . </s>
personally I argue in favour of a rather hard line , and I support Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment table by the Socialist Group . </s>
in fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relation with the representative of an Austrian government which include member of the Austrian Freedom Party . </s>
include Jörg Haider 's party in a coalition government make the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe , and set an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate country . </s>
the Austrian People 's Party must accept some historical responsibility for this . </s>
it be our fundamental value which be at stake here . </s>
as the democratically elect representative of the European people , we have no choice . </s>
we must reject what be unacceptable , as our constituent demand . </s>
because , when the spectre of barbarism resurface , failure to oppose be tantamount to capitulation . </s>
I abstain in the vote on adopt the resolution . </s>
I condemn Jörg Haider 's racist and xenophobic policy . </s>
however , I can accept that an Eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State . </s>
I can therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I can vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right . </s>
- ( SV ) obviously , the political leader of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party . </s>
the political leader of Europe be entitle to express their view of political development in another Member State , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politician in a local authority . </s>
Finland 's experience , however , be that integration , rather than isolation , be the good way of combat antidemocratic force . </s>
I therefore vote against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presuppose that all party have respect for human right . </s>
the Eu Presidency 's &quot; common reaction &quot; against the formation of the government in Austria be legally unjustified . </s>
the treaty do not authorise this reaction by the @card@ Member States . </s>
nor should we isolate the force in Austria which wish to work for human right . </s>
despite these objection of mine to the Council 's action and despite my view that it be good to work for integration than to employ isolating tactic , it be important to show clearly where the European Parliament stand on question of racism , which be why I vote in favour of the resolution at the final vote . </s>
that conclude the vote . </s>
adjournment of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourn . </s>
( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) resumption of the session I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Thursday 3 February @card@ . </s>
approval of the Minutes of the previous sit the Minutes of the sit on Thursday 3 February have be distribute . </s>
be there any comment ? </s>
I can see from your reaction that many of the member of Parliament have not receive the Minutes and clearly you can approve Minutes which you have not see . </s>
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this . </s>
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes . </s>
madam President , on a point of order . </s>
the BBC this morning report that a British Member of this House , hold a senior position within his delegation , continue to offer strategic advice to private client , but do not state in the Register of Interests who these client be . </s>
the people of Europe have a right to expect their representative to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this be be do in all case if the information be both publicly available and easily accessible . </s>
madam President , since these matter be currently be consider by the Quaestors , may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests be bring up to date and modify to cover instance of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the Register be not only available for inspection by this House , but be also publish on the Internet ? </s>
thank you , Mr Davies . </s>
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors . </s>
madam President , on a point of order . </s>
as this be the first valentine 's day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by make a firm commitment to tackle heart disease , the big killer in the European Union . </s>
I would urge member to sign up to the commitment make today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child bear in the new millennium have the right to live until the age of at least @card@ without suffer from avoidable cardiovascular disease . </s>
Happy Valentine 's day ! </s>
madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raise by Mr Davies about the very serious allegation make on BBC radio this morning . </s>
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two member who be name in this particular BBC interview be not run their company from this Parliament or from parliamentary office , because that would be a very serious matter indeed . </s>
in the past the British Conservatives ' double standard have bring the United Kingdom 's House of Commons into disrepute , and there be a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament . </s>
thank you , Mr Murphy . </s>
as I inform Mr Davies , I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors . </s>
madam President , on a point of order . </s>
I have already write to you on a number of occasion concern how point of order be raise in the House . </s>
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies be speak . </s>
why do he not mention the fact that one of his own liberal colleague also have a consultancy that be under investigation by the BBC ? </s>
be this House go to let its agenda be determine by scurrilous report on a programme which base its news item on lie , or be it go to get down to serious work and address the challenge face Europe ? </s>
gentleman , obviously the quaestors who look into this matter be not go to be base their assessment just on information from radio programme . </s>
they will look into the matter thoroughly . </s>
madam President , I believe I be express the feeling of a great number of member of Parliament in most of the political group when I say that the message which the President of the Commission send to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago create some unease . </s>
be it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his good wish for success , or to say , &quot; I be sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as show by your predecessor to liberty , democracy , respect for human right and fundamental freedom &quot; , or indeed that he await productive and constructive cooperation ? </s>
this be why , Madam President , I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he mean to give these word , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which be unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that include counter to the intention of Mr Prodi , towards make the dangerous political operation take place in Austria a commonplace . </s>
thank you , Mr Wurtz . </s>
I would ask you , lady and gentleman , not to start a debate at this point . </s>
this be just a procedural motion . </s>
let me remind you , Mr Wurtz , that we shall be see Mr Prodi tomorrow . </s>
he be go to make a statement on the Commission 's programme . </s>
naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him question in the speech you make follow this statement , just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you . </s>
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agree . </s>
madam President , it be with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raise here twice before . </s>
I have already tell you on a number of occasion that we , on behalf of the Dutch contingency , would like a Dutch television channel . </s>
There be now @card@ channel here in this Parliament , include two Greek , one Portuguese , one Finnish and one Belgian , but still no Dutch , and as many as seven English , six German and six French . </s>
I be promise back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January . </s>
it be now February and we be still wait . </s>
I would ask you once again to work on this . </s>
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy be at work here prevent a Dutch channel from be transmit by satellite . </s>
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , let me say how disappointed I be , because I personally think this problem have be resolve long ago . </s>
I have clearly receive your series of message on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti have an answer for you . </s>
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion . </s>
madam President , as my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleague happy . </s>
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have have technical discussion about the various channel on television and radio , and I have already start mailing colleague in this connection . </s>
if it be of any comfort to her , the Irish have not get their channel yet either . </s>
there seem to be intractable technical problem but we be definitely work on it . </s>
thank you for give me the opportunity to clarify this . </s>
I be not so sure that our Dutch member will be reassure on the ground that the Irish member too be unable to receive a national channel . </s>
I think we must do what we can to see that all member can receive their own national channel . </s>
thank you , Mrs Banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this . </s>
madam President , I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission 's doctrine be not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that , until prove otherwise , we be not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable . </s>
Austria , therefore , be perfectly entitle to form its government and the President of the Commission be perfectly entitle , and even duty bind , to offer Austria his good wish . </s>
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other member of his party , the French communist mayor , be send bulldozer against immigrant hostel in France . </s>
agenda the next item be the final version of the draft agenda as draw up by the conference of president , pursuant to Rule @card@ of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
a ) Sittings from @card@ to @card@ February @card@ in Strasbourg relate to Wednesday : president . </s>
in view of the fact that no Council representative be able to attend on Wednesday evening , a number of group - the Group of the European People 's Party , the Group of the Party of European Socialists , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left - request that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok 's report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta be deal with during the joint debate and that these two item plus Mr Swoboda 's report be bring forward in the agenda . </s>
this would then give us , for Wednesday 's sit , the two Council statement on the coherence of Union policy with development policy and on the UN ' Human Rights ' sit , follow by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the report by Mr Swoboda , Mr Corrie , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs . </s>
be there anyone who wish to speak on behalf of these group in favour of this proposal ? </s>
since no one wish to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) relate to Thursday : president . </s>
I have receive several propose amendment relate to the topical and urgent subject of major importance . </s>
on the subject of human right , I have receive two proposal for addition : one from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitle ' Cambodia ' and the other from the Group of the green , for an item entitle ' Pinochet ' . </s>
as you know , we can only include five item in the ' Human Rights ' section . </s>
accord to the list give in the final version of the agenda , there be already four item . </s>
we can therefore table only one additional item . </s>
who wish to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia ? </s>
madam President , it be hugely important to the Liberal Group that we talk about the situation in Cambodia , and that this be do at this particular time , not only on account of the letter which UN Secretary-General , Kofi Annan , have write to the government in Cambodia , ask it to take step , at long last , to set up a special tribunal in order to call the leader of the Khmer Rouge to account , but also because the Hun Sen regime , obviously not content with the attempted assassination of the leader of the opposition , Mr Sam Raninsy , have now consider that his parliamentary immunity should be lift to boot , so that he can simply be bring before the court . </s>
the international community have ask for justification for what be happen in Cambodia . </s>
after all , we approve the election in Cambodia , in what be one of the big fiasco on the electoral observation front . </s>
only this Parliament have emerge with some of its credit intact . </s>
I think that we , as a Parliament , even now have to assume our responsibility and speak out on the situation in Cambodia . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) President . </s>
the item on Cambodia be therefore add to the ' Human Rights ' section . </s>
this render the propose item on Pinochet null and void . </s>
in addition , I have receive some proposal for subject to be include in the topical and urgent debate . </s>
here we be not add any more sub-items under the ' Human Rights ' head , we be introduce new item . </s>
There be three proposal : one proposal from the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left to add an item entitle , ' Moratorium on the death penalty in the United States and the case of Betty Beets ' ; a second proposal from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to add an item entitle , ' the Pinochet affair ' ; and a third from the Group of the green / European Free Alliance for the inclusion of a new point , ' environmental disaster in the Danube ' . </s>
in view of the time available give that , as you know , we have a Commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current list already include two item , we can only add two additional item . </s>
I shall take the proposal from the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic green leave first . </s>
( Parliament reject the proposal ) President . </s>
we will now take the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party . </s>
be there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal ? </s>
madam President , it be remarkable that the European Parliament have not yet adopt a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrant have already be issue . </s>
since the Belgian government 's appeal to a high court be declare admissible last week and since the decision have essentially not yet be take , it be important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial . </s>
it be inconceivable that the European Parliament , which quite rightly pay so much attention to respect human right , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this . </s>
madam President , this matter be far too serious to be deal with by mean of an urgent procedure at this time . </s>
firstly , the European Parliament have already express its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet , but , furthermore , there be certain question to be bear in mind . </s>
the first be that this matter be sub judice in several European country , and I would like to remind member that there be still no European judicial area nor a European legal system . </s>
we be in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it do not yet exist . </s>
secondly , there be currently a democratically elect government in Chile , lead by Ricardo Núñez , whose first declaration be that all those who have commit this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system , which be independent , be currently examine @card@ complaint lodge against General Pinochet , concern his crime against humanity . </s>
I believe that this be a serious issue which we be oblige to follow up , but it should not be deal with by mean of urgent procedure . </s>
we believe that justice should be do in this case , but this be not the most appropriate procedure . </s>
( Parliament reject the proposal ) President . </s>
we now come to the third proposal which be for ' environmental disaster in the water of the Danube ' , a proposal table by the Group of the green / European Free Alliance . </s>
be there a Member who wish to speak in favour of this proposal ? </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , what have occur in a tributary of the Danube be consider by many expert to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster . </s>
it affect not only Romania , but also Yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire Danube basin . </s>
we consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation , and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) President . </s>
still relate to Thursday 's sit , the PPE Group have request that Mrs Cederschiöld 's report on increase protection by penal sanction against counterfeit in connection with the introduction of the euro should be bring forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda . </s>
be there a Member who wish to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ? </s>
madam President , the agenda have be rearrange so many time that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal . </s>
it be not a very time-consuming matter , but it be extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delay . </s>
it be in fact about protect the euro against counterfeit , which be an extremely urgent matter . </s>
we have try to drive this proposal through . </s>
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) relate to Friday : president . </s>
relate to Friday , on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal service and the Group of the Party of European Socialists be request that the motion for resolution should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels , as envisage in the final version of the draft agenda . </s>
be there a Member who wish to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ? </s>
madam President , with apology to my friend , Enrique Barón Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal . </s>
I be surprised it have even be make , because we come to an agreement follow an exchange in the conference of president . </s>
I think that your proposal , Madam President , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a late date , be a reasonable one . </s>
the reason be as follow : this issue concern no less than 1 @card@ @card@ employee within the European Union . </s>
we already have a directive . </s>
it be not an old one , it be issue in @card@ . </s>
decide upon future policy line , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without have have time to consult the trade union or have discussion with all the social partner , I feel , run counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matter which directly involve the social operator . </s>
I propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangement as per the agenda , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a late date . </s>
madam President , I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation , and I be go give this explanation before the whole House . </s>
we have reach this agreement on principle in the conference of president . </s>
at the time , I do not know that Commissioner Bolkestein be go to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter . </s>
my group have debate this matter and consider that , give the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it be appropriate that Parliament make an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week 's debate . </s>
madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this be about . </s>
it have nothing to do with any dispute on the substance ; it be just about the follow question : when will the commission - have already have a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ? </s>
our sole intention in table the motion be to ensure that the deadline which be promise be now finally adhere to , and it be therefore important that we act as quickly as possible . </s>
that be why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) Madam President , as you know the Cederschiöld report have be take off Thursday 's agenda . </s>
that ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday . </s>
since we will be very press for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matter to be address in an hour and a half , I simply want to ask whether the sessional service might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there be sufficient speak time . </s>
in general the way in which sitting have be manage in recent week seem to me to have be very chaotic . </s>
last Thursday speaking time be extremely tight and then suddenly we have between one and one-and-a-half hour when there be nothing on the agenda and we have to wait for the vote . </s>
on Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda . </s>
that be absolutely absurd . </s>
I really should like to ask that a review be carry out of the way in which sitting be manage . </s>
this sound perfectly feasible . </s>
we shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , consider the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld 's report . </s>
this be all I be talk about here , just that . </s>
madam President , I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday , which you have not yet announce . </s>
I understand that there be no argument about the fact that the Council declaration , on the next sit of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , be not go to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions , and that this declaration have be propose for the plenary part-session in March , so that it may be deliver in a solemn and formal way . </s>
I understand that there be agreement on this issue . </s>
madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference be make to a series of report on the BBC today programme this morning , which claim that certain of my colleague be run personal lobbying company or somehow misuse their position as member of this House . </s>
these be serious allegation . </s>
they be completely untrue , malicious , politically bias and be broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood . </s>
we be take legal advice . </s>
my colleague ' register of interest be complete . </s>

( FR ) Madam President , lady and gentleman , commissioner and member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I be give the task of draw up the European Parliament 's report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III . </s>
upon referral to committee , we examine over a hundred amendment and , so far , @card@ amendment , some of which have already be present in committee , have once again be table . </s>
before discuss the content of the resolution , I should like to inform you of the element which I take account of and which guide my work as rapporteur . </s>
first of all , I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative , found on the principle of transnationality and innovation . </s>
this programme constitute a drive force for development on the European scale . </s>
INTERREG be one of the four Community initiative schedule for the period @card@ , and be the one with the large budget for implementation , I. E. EUR @card@ billion as oppose to EUR @card@ billion at the present time . </s>
the INTERREG initiative , create in @card@ , be build upon the wish to make the region of Europe ready for a ' Europe without frontier ' in the context of establish the great single market . </s>
at the time of the reform of the structural fund in @card@ and @card@ , the INTERREG CIP have incorporate new strand contribute to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution network . </s>
these programme promote cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encourage balanced development of the Community area . </s>
the INTERREG III programme , for which we have before us today the guideline issue by the European Commission , pursuant to the term of European Community Regulation no @card@ de @card@ lay down general provision on the Structural Funds , continue these measure . </s>
it be base on three strand . </s>
strand a organise cross-border cooperation between regional and local authority in border region , at both internal and external border of the European Union , on the basis of joint cross-border development strategy which Member States ' local and regional authority be responsible for implement . </s>
strand B govern transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authority in various Member States or applicant country regard regional development , transport network and the environment . </s>
member state , i. e. national authority , be responsible for implement this strand . </s>
finally , strand C organise interregional cooperation between different region of the Member States or third country to exchange experience under strand A and B and cooperate in the field of research and technological development , subject to consultation with the European Commission which be responsible for its implementation . </s>
the new INTERREG programme , in the form in which we have receive it , take into consideration the need engender by enlargement to the country of Eastern and Central Europe and to island region and most remote region . </s>
the Commission propose redistribute the INTERREG funding as follow : between @card@ and @card@ % for strand A , 6 % for strand C , and the remainder for strand B , i. e. from @card@ up to a maximum of @card@ % . </s>
the European Commission draw up the list of eligible region for strand a and strand B. it base its assessment principally on the map of region eligible during the previous programming period . </s>
the most remote region may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draw up a list of priority area and eligible measure which for strand a be not comprehensive , but be comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserve the option to , at a late date , put forward topic it consider important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between region , for strand C. the adoption procedure for the programme be establish by the general regulation on structural fund . </s>
proposal be draw up by Member States and be submit for approval to the European Commission , which check their conformity with the general guideline , adopt . </s>
these proposal must include a number of element , an overview of the cross-border or transnational priority and strategy , a description of the measure necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan . </s>
I belong to the great majority of member of Parliament who vote in favour of continue the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme . </s>
I regret that Parliament be not inform about the appraisal of the previous programme , which would have enable the new measure implement to reach optimum efficiency , but I acknowledge that this be not an easy operation . </s>
I also regret the fact that we have an extremely short period to work in , as the text be examine in parliamentary committee on @card@ November last year and then on @card@ January . </s>
I further regret the fact that neither the region , nor the representative regional organisation be involve in frame the programme . </s>
in promote cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross-disciplinary instrument be the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intend to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , the conference on rural development hold in Cork from 7 to 9 November @card@ set rural development as one of the European Union 's priority since it be essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture , to provide farmer with an environment contain the necessary infrastructure and service , and to ensure great respect for the environment and a good quality of life , diversification and job creation . </s>
an integrated development policy for all rural area in the European Union be therefore need , consist of the follow element : an integrated , multi-sectoral approach , simplification of administrative procedure , improvement of the partnership between European institution and national and local actor and protection of the environment . </s>
in its @card@ policy paper , Agenda @card@ , the Commission set out two key principle on which rural development policy should be base : the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for develop rural area . </s>
the first principle mean create a new ' pact ' between farmer and society , make the farmer ' steward of the countryside ' and ensure that society be prepare to pay for the environmental service need to safeguard the countryside 's recreation value . </s>
the second principle be base on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunity in rural area be outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrate rural development policy with agricultural sector policy need to be implement . </s>
in this way rural development be become a pillar of the cap . </s>
the Leader Community initiative be launch in @card@ to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measure by adapt them to local need . </s>
the follow objective be set : improve the development potential of rural area by call upon local initiative ; promote the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminate this knowledge to other rural area . </s>
leader I apply to the rural area cover by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b , and @card@ local action group participate in it , with financing of EUR 1 @card@ million . </s>
leader II ( @card@ ) , for which a total evaluation have , unfortunately , not yet be complete , have a wide scope than Leader I : there be probably over @card@ beneficiary and the sum allocate , after reallocation of resource , probably amount to over EUR 4 @card@ million . </s>
in October @card@ , follow the success of Leader I and Leader II , the Commission decide to extend the initiative . </s>
for the @card@ period provision have be make , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of EUR 2 @card@ million , and an indicative allocation for each Member State have be set . </s>
leader + differ from the previous stage in that all rural area will be eligible . </s>
it be also more ambitious , and well gear to the challenge which rural area will have to meet . </s>
the main change be as follow : all rural area will be eligible to benefit from Leader + ; the selection criterion for local measure will be more rigorous ; integrated local development plan will be introduce as priority theme , such as the use of information technology , improve the quality of life , and add value to local product . </s>
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , as I be say , it emphasise the innovative development strategy and because it be more ambitious , even though there be still the need to make the criterion by which area qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural area with high or low population density . </s>
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skill and for the implementation of joint project between different area of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measure already in existence , such as the Carrefours . </s>
I share the Commission 's preference for the use of global grant while urge , however , that the accounting requirement of national and regional authority should be precisely and painstakingly define . </s>
I regret the delay with which Leader , as be the case with the other three initiative , be present to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entail for the whole procedure . </s>
finally , I be concern by the paucity of the amount allocate , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme be available to all the country of the Union and will be implement for a year longer than the previous Leader II . </s>
I would like to thank the Commission service for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleague in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have make through their amendment . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , my report on Equal take the form of an opinion deliver as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative , whose objective be to promote transnational cooperation and through it new method of combat all form of discrimination and inequality in connection with the labour market . </s>
the report be a major undertaking because it also incorporate opinion from four further committee - from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , and the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs . </s>
this Community initiative succeed the two forerunner programme ADAPT and employment and have a much small budget of around EUR @card@ billion . </s>
the initiative adopt a completely new approach , which be to develop innovative employment model within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnership . </s>
the intention be clear : targeted project be to be develop at transnational level , project which be base on the employment policy guideline of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunity . </s>
this objective be very much to be welcome and also meet with a broad consensus in this House . </s>
in addition , Equal should feed into the National Action plan for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitor through these Action Plans . </s>
it be an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiative , Urban , Leader and INTERREG , be finance out of the structural fund . </s>
in my report I have try to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build great openness and flexibility into the system of development partnership . </s>
I consider technical support to be necessary but , give the problem with the former Taos , no new Taos should be set up without Parliament 's approval so as to prevent political responsibility from be pass down to the technical assistance level . </s>
nevertheless , technical assistance be necessary . </s>
particular attention be also pay to the dissemination of result and learn from each other by identify good practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming . </s>
I have endeavour to secure the wide possible support for the report . </s>
this have mean a reduction in the number of amendment - from over @card@ in committee to @card@ for the plenary - which have also create numerous opportunity for compromise . </s>
a compromise have now also be reach on the issue of asylum seeker . </s>
however , in this context , Madam President , to allow us to work out the detail , I should like to request that the vote on the Equal report be hold not tomorrow but on Wednesday . </s>
I believe that it be important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission be also oblige to take into consideration the constructive proposal make by the European Parliament , because Parliament put the appropriation for Equal in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that member ' idea be also reflect in this Community initiative . </s>
in this connection , the European Parliament be also justify in insist that it should be possible to amend the thematic priority only after a further hearing in Parliament . </s>
equal should live up to its name , and this be my firm intention . </s>
it should provide equal opportunity for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union . </s>
it should prevent society from splinter . </s>
it should prevent exclusion from be part of everyday life . </s>
Everyone should be give the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin . </s>
that be my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support ! </s>
madam President , it be in itself an achievement that we be have this debate on the new Urban Community initiative and it be an achievement that I be here tonight because Air France cancel my flight at @card@ p. m. but I be here ! </s>
just a year ago when the Commission produce its proposal around Agenda @card@ it axe the Urban initiative . </s>
yet we as politician know that there be a groundswell of support for continue this initiative into the year @card@ . </s>
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put Urban back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn . </s>
urban policy have always be at the forefront of Eu policy . </s>
in my Member State , for example , we be develop a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce be look at the problem of urban community . </s>
with eight out of ten people in Europe live in urban area , it be right that we help our most deprive community to tackle the all too familiar problem of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problem that be associate with that . </s>
for example , in my own region , in Manchester , the Urban Community initiative have be a tremendous success . </s>
urban fund have be invest in one of the most deprive neighbourhood in the UK , in Moss Side . </s>
the Millennium Youth Park project be help to get young people re-engaged in regenerate their own community and in addition to support for small business and social policy we be begin to see a turnaround of a very deprive urban community . </s>
the work of this Urban agenda be then take out to the wide community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarket and famous British pub . </s>
this be the kind of good practice we would like to see extend across the Eu in term of communication and publicity . </s>
as regard the specific guideline govern the initiative , they be broadly define to give scope for local and regional diversity . </s>
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allow the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programme . </s>
in committee we be not in favour of reduce the number to @card@ . </s>
we be in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of @card@ be not the key factor . </s>
instead , we should go for good-quality project that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in term of loan and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect . </s>
the Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of area within the financial ceiling of their allocation . </s>
in the designation of local Urban programme we need to make good use of local indicator and statistic on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected area . </s>
in the UK the local index of deprivation be a very good example of a widely use standard and statistic to help determine not only Eu but national and regional assistance programme . </s>
this need to be acknowledge as a tool and resource in addition to the Eu criterion . </s>
I would ask you to take on board local indicator to help us do that . </s>
our most deprive urban neighbourhood face a plethora of problem : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion . </s>
often these problem be compound by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency . </s>
we therefore have unstable community which be infiltrate with crime , drug-dealing and gang . </s>
this be all too familiar in many of our urban area . </s>
All these complex problem undermine the quality of life for our urban resident , yet we have the potential in these area to create growth and prosperity . </s>
that be why again , in my report , I have ask that action under the Urban Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these area do not have single , &quot; mono &quot; problem . </s>
instead , community in urban area should be encourage to present integrated action plan to tackle their specific urban problem , use Eu resource as a value add to local action . </s>
I would like to see those action extend to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provide for in the Amsterdam Treaty . </s>
the Community initiative mean community involvement . </s>
some of the most active and committed proponent and agent of change in our urban area be local resident . </s>
we need to encourage them to participate in design and deliver project for these programme . </s>
the time-scale therefore propose by the Commission be very ambitious . </s>
it be good to have quality project with the active participation of community group than to have project deliver on time but without local participation . </s>
the Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concern the selection criterion use for the new urban initiative but it must also disclose the consultancy network which be be use to deliver the exchange of good practice . </s>
this be important in the interest of transparency and the overall effectiveness of network . </s>
finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problem face the post-industrial city we require local participation . </s>
we need to deploy the energy of the unemployed , the underuse skill of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problem . </s>
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alienation with equity , initiative and participation . </s>
this will help us to restore the credibility of the Eu and the confidence of citizen that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problem . </s>
. </s>
( it ) Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mrs McCarthy , have already point out , we can certainly consider Urban a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate hold last year on the reform of the regulation . </s>
as we have hear , the objective of Urban be the promotion of innovative strategy to promote economic and social regeneration in urban area , bear in mind that @card@ % of the population of Europe life in city . </s>
create a function urban environment in term of social policy require a policy of long-term job creation , action to combat poverty , measure to assist low-income group and old people , facility for child , racial and ethnic integration , good opportunity for participation , a targeted public health policy include measure to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measure . </s>
the Communication from the Commission take account of the need to adopt approach combine a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measure . </s>
however , we must remember that , in addition to Urban , a number of other Community instrument be also available in the social sector : innovative action under Article 6 of the ESF regulation , pilot project , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that have just be introduce by the European Parliament under the @card@ budget and the Equal and INTERREG initiative and mainstream ESF activity . </s>
as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stress in its opinion , the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergy in this context while avoid duplication of multiple funding . </s>
while , on the one hand , we believe that steering committee should ensure that the various project be coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchange of information and coordination between the department involve . </s>
not only be this coordination essential but , as we state in our opinion , exchange and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential . </s>
Mr President , the importance of this initiative be increase constantly as economic and social problem in Europe 's city intensify and the public feel more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood . </s>
that situation will be compound by social reclassifications result from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our city . </s>
address those problem be all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of city into the surround area and in view of the city ' historical and cultural role . </s>
however , in order for such an effort to succeed it be necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social group and the group particularly affect by the economic and social crisis . </s>
here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of woman , and the agency that represent them , in plan and implement the Urban initiative programme . </s>
as the Committee on Equal Opportunities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructure that will facilitate professional activity by woman , mainly by harmonise their professional and family commitment , and more generally infrastructure that promote solidarity between the generation , social solidarity . </s>
effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local level , thus increase its political importance still further since woman need to feel the effect of European policy in their day-to-day life in real term . </s>
Mr President , our committee welcome the priority propose by the Commission for the Urban programme of good integration of local community and ethnic minority and improve security and crime prevention . </s>
in committee we think that it be necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban area to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minority and therefore for measure design to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programme to be fund by Urban . </s>
we consider that increase public confidence by combat everyday urban crime be one of the central task of urban regeneration . </s>
our committee note that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measure include the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent juvenile delinquency , the reintegration of offender , and model for effective local cooperation between the various party involve , for example the police , the court and social service . </s>
we adopt our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we feel that it be particularly important to continue Urban - which in the past have be implement successfully - because , as we see it , programme of this kind be the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensure that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence . </s>
for this reason we very much welcome programme of this kind . </s>
I should like to comment on the concern which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have with regard to the large of the four Community initiative , INTERREG III . </s>
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measure to receive support under INTERREG III . </s>
in the light of the fact that @card@ % of unemployment in the Union be essentially structural and give the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border region - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this be not only reasonable but imperative . </s>
the measure eligible for funding list in Annex II of strand a do also seem encourage in this respect . </s>
in reality , however , the Commission communication do not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approach for social and employment policy aspect . </s>
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increase number of vocational training measure , especially in area with high level of long-term and youth unemployment . </s>
employment policy measure should also be eligible for funding under strand B , especially for the applicant country as part of the pre-accession strategy . </s>
in general where the employment policy measure be concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointment to the joint cooperation committee to be make on a regional basis - because the local expertise require for these specific purpose be only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measure become too abstract and therefore prove disappointing . </s>
the fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III be - in my opinion - still excessive be something which we can and indeed always must criticise , although it almost seem to me as though this be unavoidable with the Commission 's support programme . </s>
however , I should like to point out that it be precisely here that this be fatal . </s>
it be precisely where employment policy be concern that we should work towards measure which be as simplify as possible so that the social dimension of the Eu be once again give the importance which it deserve . </s>
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism consider , amongst other thing , the report on Leader + and , as a result , agree to support the process of decentralisation in the management of action , believe that that process could be effective on two condition : that local action group represent the general interest of the local community , and that Commission control mechanism be utilise to prevent local and regional political authority from use Leader + resource to support civil group and organisation which be relate to those authority . </s>
we ask for a guarantee that the decision-making body for the project be represent equally by three element : political representative and public administration , company and economic operator , and social operator , include union and non-governmental organisation . </s>
we would particularly like to stress that there must be balance representation between man and woman in all of these body . </s>
we would also like to stress that the main objective be the promotion of strategy for sustainable development , whose positive effect would extend to a broad geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it be appropriate for the project to be integrate into the development programme , include in Objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the region and country in which they be locate . </s>
we be please that all the rural area of the Union may be involve in Leader + , but we believe that it be necessary to concentrate Community resource in the less-favoured region in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union , and that state government should not divert these resource towards objective other than cohesion . </s>
the Committee believe that project finance under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development , in particular base on local tradition , technique and practice , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy . </s>
the Committee support the Commission proposal to concentrate action in small selected area and believe that , give the disperse nature of many rural inhabit location , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduce to @card@ @card@ inhabitant . </s>
we believe it be necessary to coordinate the development objective and management mechanism of action 2 and 3 , finance by Leader , with those of other action finance by other Community programme relate to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such as INTERREG , SAPAR , Phare , TACIS and Meda , in the same area . </s>
. </s>
( it ) Madam President , I shall speak for two minute on behalf of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , and for the other two minute on behalf of the socialist group that I represent within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Equal report . </s>
the Equal Community initiative , whose objective be to promote new practice and combat all form of discrimination and inequality , have be discuss in detail by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal opportunity with regard to discrimination against woman . </s>
this be because discrimination base on sex be structural and horizontal , and - give the fact that woman be not a minority but represent more than half of the world population - the Committee on Women 's Rights be of the opinion that it might have be a mistake to include discrimination base on sex with all the other form of discrimination . </s>
we believe that it should have be incorporate in a special Chapter of the Treaty devote to Equal Opportunity between woman and man . </s>
this would have be a logical consequence of the new central role give to equality between woman and man in the Treaty . </s>
have say that , we nevertheless welcome the Commission 's proposal and feel that equality between woman and man be to be promote as an integral part of all four pillar of the employment strategy and thematic field , and that equality should also be target specifically in a separate pillar . </s>
with regard to the equal proposal , in the Community Initiative Programmes , there should be a clear distinction between priority action aim at combat gender discrimination and action aim at combat other kind of discrimination . </s>
a gender-mainstreaming approach must be adopt by Member States , and they therefore need to put the emphasis on project that not only aim to promote the fight against gender discrimination , but also facilitate reconciliation of work and family life . </s>
in more general term , there be a major debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on Mrs Stenzel 's report because the approach propose by Mrs Stenzel and the one propose by my group be very different . </s>
our assessment of the Commission 's proposal be very favourable , although we be try - because the aim be for the European Parliament to express an opinion which will then have an influence on the Commission and Council 's assessment - to find solution that might lead to a convergence of opinion , so that the report will be adopt by a broad majority . </s>
some issue be more sensitive than other : partnership , for example , on which we need to reach a compromise in order to assert and support the Commission proposal . </s>
at the same time , we nevertheless need to ask the Commission for a certain amount of flexibility so that we can subsequently include other topic . </s>
technical assistance and simplification must also be include among the fundamental point . </s>
from a political point of view , the most sensitive issue be asylum-seeker . </s>
I would like to spend a few moment on this since we feel that the Commission 's proposal be considerate and positive . </s>
we have put a lot of time into come up with a definition of ' asylum-seeker ' because it be difficult from a legal point of view , but I think that we have now achieve a compromise with the rapporteur - at least I hope we have - and the silence on the report on asylum-seeker , which Parliament be go to put to the vote must be see as Parliament support the Commission 's position . </s>
we would never have accept Parliament backing down - this be our position - from what the Commission have already propose , and I be keen to stress this . </s>
I agree with the rapporteur that we should hold the vote on Wednesday , as she propose , to allow more time to seek out every possible solution in order to hopefully make Parliament 's report more progressive , and not more backward-looking , than the Commission proposal . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Stenzel , lady and gentleman , before address the equal report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guideline on which the report be base . </s>
the basic objective of an EU-wide employment policy be lay down in the guideline and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability . </s>
these objective be obviously intend to make employee as useful and usable as possible to the economy . </s>
however , the aim of an approach which really seek to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people 's self-determination . </s>
only then do it stop be a question of economic usability and start be about people have equal right to shape their own life . </s>
Mrs Stenzel 's report have , however , turn out very well , at least where the prescribed guideline be concern . </s>
all asylum seeker and refugee be to be include explicitly in the programme , although this should be self-evident . </s>
nevertheless the conservative vote against this in the committee . </s>
I would ask them the follow question : do your policy seek to marginalise people ? </s>
What be the idea behind prevent people from work when they wish to do so ? </s>
do this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ? </s>
it be also worth mention that this be a mainstreaming programme , because there remain a shortcoming in the report . </s>
particular emphasis be give to the point that woman 's opportunity on the labour market ought to be improve and that to achieve this more crèch should be build . </s>
Anyone who let man happily climb the career ladder and worry only about childcare place without fight against the way in which the work of reproduction be share out unevenly have not - and unfortunately that include woman - understand the concept of mainstreaming ! </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopt this opinion on the equal report at its conclude discussion with no vote against and one abstention . </s>
I be deliberately state this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there be in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . </s>
this cross-group support for the opinion be explain by the conclusion , which be devote to the question of how issue relate to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combine with action to combat all form of discrimination and inequality in connection with the labour market . </s>
the member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of area of the Commission proposal which they would criticise : firstly , for example , the insufficient thematic guideline lay down for the development partnership activity ; secondly , the fact that strict selection criterion for evaluate the project proposal will only be draw up only at a late stage by the Commission and thirdly , the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance body . </s>
that be why a ceiling need to be set for administrative expenditure . </s>
the committee base its conclusion on these critical comment . </s>
we attach particular importance to link the creation of new job for disadvantaged and exclude people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprise with promote the establishment of new small and medium-sized business bear in mind the necessary economic structural change . </s>
dovetail the activity under the Community initiative with the European employment initiative be an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attain the objective of the Equal programme . </s>
we fully support the innovative approach towards set up development partnership and organise the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the Equal programme . </s>
the specific target of derive European added value bring the regional cooperation up to European level while retain the cooperation of the various regional operator . </s>
this be a good approach and that be why we have also support it . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , it have already be mention today that the first Urban initiative be an unqualified success . </s>
the fact that this initiative will now be continue in the form of Urban II , albeit with a small budget , be something for which we have to thank individual , committed member of this Parliament , include in particular - as far as I have hear as a new Member of this Parliament - the rapporteur Mrs McCarthy , whom I should therefore like to thank very much for her dedication and of course also for her report on Urban II . </s>
a new feature of the Urban II initiative be that it have be tailor to small city or part of city . </s>
this be important because it be precisely small city which often find it hard to access aid . </s>
and yet the problem which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in city of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect . </s>
To increase the effectiveness of individual measure the number of project for Urban II have be limit to @card@ . </s>
I think that it be important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many project they each wish to divide the support fund to which they be entitle . </s>
in any case it be necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it be not only area of large city which be again in receipt of the support . </s>
there Urban II would only be a drop in the ocean ; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop . </s>
just as important in my view be not to broaden the selection criterion for Urban II too much and thus water them down . </s>
it be precisely a strictly define list of criterion which be essential if the programme which be fund be to be model and be transferable to other problem city in the future . </s>
from my own experience of local government in an old industrialise region beset with problem , I should like , in conclusion , to ask for your particular support , lady and gentleman , for two point in the report which alongside the social policy aspect be , I believe , essential . </s>
firstly , environmental protection be essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding . </s>
secondly , prevent and combat routine urban crime and crime relate to drug dealing must start at local level . </s>
these be essential step towards increase the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the Urban II initiative . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to thank the rapporteur , who have manage to produce excellent report in just a short time . </s>
however , criticism have be voice within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee . </s>
the report be late , and , in addition , they be very hastily discuss by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . </s>
a good opportunity to discuss the result , good practice and shortcoming of the early programme be therefore lose . </s>
our group be keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focus on area outside the European Union . </s>
such important area include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either . </s>
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of fund and emphasise the importance of good coordination of the INTERREG , TACIS , ISPA and Phare programme . </s>
this coordination be at present lack , and the Commission have not as yet make any precise proposal to improve it . </s>
we here in Parliament be wait for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible . </s>
it be of decisive importance to get local business , organisation and other player involve in the practical implementation of programme . </s>
experience show that project of cooperation need good planning and close monitoring and need to be generally more successful . </s>
project have often remain half-finished , and their efficiency have be drain by administration and bureaucracy . </s>
we also have to demand that our partner in cooperation be commit to project and fulfil their share of the agreement . </s>
our group be review a few amendment that be reject by the committee . </s>
I would like to mention here again the Urban report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statement , have deal admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR @card@ per inhabitant as per the Commission 's guideline . </s>
it will not work as an automatic target , but must be apply in the target area accord to prevailing condition . </s>
this be such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusion have to draw . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , INTERREG be one of the most European of all the structural fund . </s>
here , project cover only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbour region in two or more country . </s>
unfortunately this be only true for part of the money , that be only for the border within the Eu . </s>
but it be precisely the region on border with third country which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation . </s>
the regulation pretend that there be one , but there be not . </s>
the fact be that the Commission have not amend the regulation for year , although Parliament have be call for it to do so for some time . </s>
the practical consequence for these region in the immediate future be that support for border area will again be downgrade . </s>
since @card@ , Parliament have be call for a joint fund to be create for cooperation with third country in order to resolve difficulty . </s>
nothing have happen ! </s>
the difficulty be once again be allow to persist , to the detriment of the region concern . </s>
Parliament be here renew its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund be create and to the regulation be amend once more in cooperation with the other commissioner . </s>
we want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers ! </s>
Mr President , a third of Eu money be invest in fund for all kind of development cause . </s>
accord to my group , this be excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within region , town and population group be eliminate or if health and the environment improve . </s>
that be a question of solidarity and progress . </s>
but dish out increase amount of money be no guarantee for improve spending . </s>
the local council and region where the money end up have since gain practical experience . </s>
they find it be extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy cause . </s>
anything relate to economic growth and infrastructure usually score quite highly , but social goal and environmental cause often can count on approval . </s>
since there be great uncertainty surround the way in which rule be interpret , local council and region have now start to enlist the service of expensive bureau . </s>
the task of these expert be to gauge to what extent European Commission official would be prepare to approve plan . </s>
in some case , I get the impression that it be not about solidarity or alleviate the most desperate problem , but about propaganda and uphold vested interest in exchange for the European Union 's blessing . </s>
it seem that the key goal there have become the construction and painting of propaganda panel advertise the fact that such and such a project have be co-finance by the European Union . </s>
too much money be waste on propaganda and investigation bureau , consultation and control , and a great deal of money end up back in the country where it be collect in the first place . </s>
after the planned accession of new Member States with their @card@ million inhabitant , the prosperity level of which be at one third or two third of the average level of the current Eu Member States , this squander will generate even more protest . </s>
in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , the Confederal Group of the European United Left be in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , Mr Nogueira Román , on Leader . </s>
he be right to point out that it be not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural area . </s>
if there be a choice between invest in innovation project or inject most of the funding into bring on deprive area , we would opt for the latter as this do the most to benefit equality . </s>
after all , innovation in area that have already grow prosperous be pay dividend even now and take place without European funding . </s>
a second point where we need to focus our attention be the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local council . </s>
the emphasis be on local group in which the authority , non-profit-making organisation and profit-making company join force . </s>
the discussion have centre on the allocation formula to be apply . </s>
in this respect , one of the variant consider be reminiscent of the Dutch polder model , the structurally plan cooperation between government , trade union and employer ' organisation . </s>
let us not forget that election for local council and regional parliament be hold so as to represent the entire population . </s>
so , really , these body should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wish of the union movement and environmental movement in the process . </s>
my group welcome the fact that the union movement and environmental movement be expressly give their own role to play , as their input in society be important in our view . </s>
this could prevent local government that be function in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglect their duty of input from the very start . </s>
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicate that , unfortunately , democracy be not fully function yet . </s>
One of the objection be that , due to the restricted role of the elect body , business gain more influence . </s>
as long as the economy do not weigh up the need of all in a democratic way but be more concern with make a profit for the benefit of a few , it be questionable as to whether democracy function well under the rule of employer than under the rule of local council . </s>
we believe in ' one man , one vote ' more than ' one share , one vote ' . </s>
Mr President , there be economic frontier within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of good , person , service and capital be fully operate at this time . </s>
but for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it be important that all region within Europe , of which there be over @card@ , can economically compete within this very challenging environment . </s>
some area within the European Union be economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita . </s>
There be poor region within the Union which need to be give European assistance to improve the fabric of their economy so that they can compete within the European Union structure . </s>
that be why , when we look at the Eu Financial Perspective between @card@ and @card@ , and @card@ and @card@ , we find such a large proportion of the Eu budget be put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund . </s>
There be twin problem that still remain for many region in Europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in term of road , water treatment facility and related transport network ; secondly , the need to put in place initiative to combat youth and long-term unemployment , which be a constant social problem in many urban and rural part of Europe . </s>
There must always be a commitment to ensure that we do not only build a Europe of the city alone . </s>
we need to ensure that job creation initiative be in place to promote employment opportunity in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural part of Europe as well . </s>
the core aspect of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the Eu initiative programme , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , Equal and the leader + scheme . </s>
between these three programme there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the Eu to promote cross-border development , combat the problem of long-term unemployment and support rural development scheme . </s>
Mr President , quite a few town and city within the European Union have to contend with deprivation . </s>
the Member States do not always have sufficient mean at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately . </s>
this be why it be useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under Urban . </s>
over the next seven year , the Commission 's proposal concern Urban will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of area stand to benefit . </s>
in common with Mrs McCarthy , I have to note that the number of area have be drastically reduce . </s>
it be desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of project themselves within the confine of a certain budget . </s>
as far as the budget be concern , as already state , Urban be there to support and complement national policy . </s>
in order to generate extra mean if necessary , I think it be entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investor . </s>
consequently , we can support Amendment no 2 of the green , as bear out in the committee meeting . </s>
in addition , I be of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contribution be concern , should incentivise . </s>
structural support be say to cause subsidy-dependence . </s>
we would then be overreach ourselves . </s>
I would like to finish off by make a general comment on INTERREG . </s>
in my opinion , funding for cross-border initiative should only be provide if it be actually require by the region . </s>
when project be implement , it be also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation . </s>
accord to the report issue by the court of auditor on the year @card@ , this be not an imagine risk . </s>
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradiction between general policy and actual project . </s>
before I begin I will take the liberty of express my consternation at the way in which Austria have be prejudge by @card@ Council representative . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiative be be prune to a total of four . </s>
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it have be accord . </s>
however , the delayed presentation of the draft guideline have cause a number of problem . </s>
the region have not be sufficiently involve in the preparation of the guideline , although this demand be often make in the debate about the reform of the structural fund . </s>
There be no direct transition between INTERREG II and III , the practical consequence of which be uncertainty in term of planning and gap in funding . </s>
that be a shame because it threaten perfectly sensible project . </s>
when INTERREG be implement , it will need to be coordinate and synchronise with the other financial instrument concern . </s>
this be particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the fund deploy . </s>
however , problem will arise in particular from the fact that under Phare , for example , fund be manage on an annual basis and allocation of appropriation be project-related , whereas INTERREG fund be multiannual and be allocate on a measures-related basis . </s>
this will cause practical problem in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Community initiative Leader prove itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative development and pilot project both within and outside rural area . </s>
the preservation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - Leader + - be therefore greatly to be welcome . </s>
the new leader + programme now cover all rural area in the European Union , which will open up great possibility for potential project . </s>
it be important for there to be coordination between Leader + and the other support initiative in the European Union , but coordination with other national support scheme be also just as important . </s>
overlap between support scheme must be avoid and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effect . </s>
in this context the aim of step up networking between eligible zone under Leader be very welcome . </s>
Agriculture be one of the cornerstone of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the Leader initiative . </s>
in the same way , through the Leader initiative , structural change in agriculture can be support by create new job in rural area . </s>
attention must be pay in the leader + programme to all the sector of the economy in rural area ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result . </s>
leader must now move into the implementation phase . </s>
the operational programme need to be approve as quickly as possible by the Commission , which imply practical and efficient administration of application and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible . </s>
Five month be provide for this . </s>
that seem to me to be rather too long . </s>
effort should be make here to achieve short time . </s>
because anyone who develop a project and have it ready will also want to start implement it as soon as possible . </s>
despite all the delight over the rework of this Community initiative Leader + , I do still have one further concern . </s>
in its proposal the Commission call for an observatory for the leader + programme without go into detail on how this proposal would be implement . </s>
for me this raise the follow question : who will work there ? </s>
How will these people be select ? </s>
where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be locate ? </s>
I do think , though , that the leader + programme have not get a penny to spare on additional administrative task , which in the normal course of event would have to be carry out by the Commission in any case . </s>
in addition , experience from other field where observatory have be set up show that , apart from rather dubiously create job , they be not of any great benefit . </s>
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duty directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that Leader + programme run smoothly . </s>
assessment and publication be part of this , and it have of course assume responsibility for these in the past . </s>
Mr President , the majority of the border , which have divide Europe for century , be artificially create , separate single geographic space and create serious disparity in term of balanced development and cohesion . </s>
our internal border , or what remain of them , no long cause war , but they do continue to generate economic backwardness , social barrier and a lack of cultural communication between the people of Europe . </s>
the Community 's institution be oblige to work towards overcome these border scar , which contradict the spirit of European unity . </s>
the economic and social cohesion which we propose be base , by mean of the INTERREG initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border area and the outermost region of our continent . </s>
INTERREG have always be at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory . </s>
although the European Parliament support this initiative , our only regret be that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have see any evaluation of INTERREG II . </s>
however , we be aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeopardise the success of various project and the continuity of the project which be currently underway . </s>
the success of INTERREG be clear and that be the opinion of the local , regional and national authority which have participate in the cofinanced project . </s>
the people who have participate in this initiative have learn the importance of learn together , of innovation , of share project and good practice and of understand and tolerate each other . </s>
There be many interesting question relate to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc . </s>
however , I would like to concentrate on the management body . </s>
we must create joint , interregional and transnational management body , in which all local and regional authority , as well as economic and social operator , play an active role . </s>
There must not be any repetition of case of parallel project on both side of a border . </s>
we must create a cross-border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , imaginatively overcome exist barrier and overcome the difficulty pose by the differ level of competence in each Member State , in each region and each municipality . </s>
a project must never fail to be implement as a result of difficulty in communication . </s>
during debate in committee , we have also point out the difficulty involve in coordinate INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instrument , such as Meda , TACIS or Phare . </s>
this Parliament 's motion for a resolution have be very attentive to these difficulty , make proposal capable of solve them to the Commission and set reasonable deadline for make the necessary change . </s>
Mr President , my reason for want to contribute to this debate be because the Urban initiative , in Ireland in particular , have be quite successful and I be keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area . </s>
it be a sad fact that there be many hundred , if not thousand , of community in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage . </s>
even in Member States and city that be extremely wealthy we have large number of people live in ghetto , in situation where there be inadequate facility , where schooling be very poor , where the physical infrastructure be under-developed and where drug and other phenomenon be rife . </s>
it seem to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it have a role in help the citizen of the European union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union work for these citizen and their family . </s>
the programme have be extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it have be successful in other country . </s>
it be quite slow in get off the ground there , but it be slow because it be necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programme . </s>
it be important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in develop this initiative . </s>
it would be very easy to have these programme develop quickly and on time if you bring in outside professional expert but that would undermine the whole purpose of the Urban programme . </s>
I should like to make one further point before I conclude : we should insist where this money be be allocate and where this programme be be develop that it be do in the context of a serious Urban development policy . </s>
this , unfortunately , be not the case in Ireland . </s>
I applaud the innovative approach of the Equal programme and the aim of integrate discriminate group into the labour market . </s>
the development partnership be a very clever idea , even though they be experimental . </s>
I have two major concern , however , about the development partnership . </s>
they should be accessible to small group , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programme . </s>
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme . </s>
I have also express concern in the past about the use of simple language and not use jargon , so that it become accessible to everyone . </s>
I be glad to see that this be accept into the report , but I can agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really be not express in simple language at all . </s>
my second concern be that some discriminate group have specific problem , for example , disabled people 's access to the workplace . </s>
project should also specifically address this problem . </s>
these concern must be look at while set up the programme . </s>
I certainly intend to do that with organisation and group in my constituency in the West Midlands . </s>
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seeker and refugee . </s>
although I be not in favour of those refugee who have be refuse refugee status and threaten with repatriation , have access to Equal , I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seeker and refugee . </s>
it be only fair and right for them to be able to access Equal in the same way as everyone else . </s>
thank you , Mr President . </s>
lady and gentleman , with the Leader report , rural development be very much to the fore . </s>
this do not happen all that often and it be gratifying , especially as the Leader programme have be key element in the Union 's rural development policy . </s>
it must be point out that these programme have not only be instrumental in structure regional planning , but have also be vital instrument for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable area such as , for example , area experience depopulation . </s>
it must be stress that in order to become eligible under the Leader programme , local operator have combine force , debate and prepare project . </s>
these programme have , therefore , be important channel for participative democracy , the rationale of the citizen for Europe . </s>
so , the concept for Leader + should retain all the positive aspect of previous programme . </s>
One urgent question be therefore raise : why , when this programme have be successfully run for ten year , be Leader + still class as experimental ? </s>
be there so many other European scheme which can boast @card@ specific original experiment which be particularly successful ? </s>
for how much longer be the Commission go to leave Leader at the experimental stage instead of bring it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ? </s>
moreover , I wonder at the reduce guideline to which the Commission wish to restrict Leader + . </s>
at a time when , Commissioner , after Seattle , we Europeans be fight on the ground of multifunctionality in rural development project , why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criterion with resource that be far from sufficient ? </s>
as an ecologist , let meet tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approach . </s>
in this connection , the Commission be propose to limit yet further the cooperation action of local action group to only candidate country . </s>
a good solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism suggest , strengthen coordination between Leader + and the Community cooperation and partnership programme , such as INTERREG , Phare , SAPARD or Meda . </s>
the fact be , show solidarity with Eastern Europe , be all very well , but it be not enough . </s>
the tradition which have already be establish by the previous programme with the country of the south , particularly the country around the Mediterranean , must not be abandon . </s>
therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really need be codecision . </s>
Codecision would give us effective mean to progress programme of this type , which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application . </s>
Mr President , I have a few very brief comment . </s>
we be debate the planning phase and guideline for the four Community initiative without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period . </s>
this be not very good at all . </s>
programme and objective usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their result be not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plan often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud . </s>
the Community initiative we be debate could play a positive part subject to certain precondition . </s>
they must , however , not be subordinate to the objective and aspiration of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self-sufficient role . </s>
for example , adapt Equal to the objective of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relation transform this initiative into a new version of local employment contract . </s>
extend the Leader initiative to every area in the Union entail the risk of marginalising deprive area even more , to the benefit of more develop area . </s>
the INTERREG initiative must include eligible area with special emphasis on border area , island and both mountain and non-mountain area , such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece , whose omission from Annex I of the Commission 's communication be ill-considered . </s>
Mr President , rural development have be identify by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler . </s>
our response to rural decline have come late in the day , but I suppose well late than never . </s>
family farming be now recognise as central to the European agricultural model and be an objective to be address , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda @card@ . </s>
in my view the next five year will decide the future of thousand of marginal family farm . </s>
it behove all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival . </s>
as the Commissioner know , farm alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural community . </s>
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy area capable of impact positively on rural development . </s>
in this regard Leader have establish itself as an effective development initiative . </s>
it provide the opportunity for local community to identify their development potential and become actively involve in address those problem . </s>
the voluntary participation of people in development programme be something that be not always fully appreciate . </s>
yet , through Leader , there can be no doubt its effectiveness as an integral part of broad Eu and national policy . </s>
in conclusion , while welcome Commission approval for Leader + , I be concern about the time delay between the ending of Leader II and the commencement of the new programme . </s>
I urge you to look seriously at this problem . </s>
a break in continuity will have serious consequence for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional worker . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , have read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative , and point out that I take part in the vote on Mr Decourrière 's report within the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as present and , particularly in the context of INTERREG III B , with the Commission 's recognition of activity contribute to the restoration of landscape run down due the level of price in the agricultural sector , a sector in which many association , especially cynegetic , be already make enormous investment in my own country . </s>
I should also like to give my consider support to the comment of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , particularly and primarily in deplore the failure to integrate the most remote region into strand a of the programme or in comment upon the lack of precision in the selection criterion for the implementation method for strand III C and , finally , in request that member of the European Parliament should be involve in the European Observatory for cross-border , transregional and interregional cooperation . </s>
I should further like to express major reservation with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B , involve associate environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura @card@ , which I think be often an excessively abstract mean of safeguard ecosystem , from which user be in danger of be exclude or severely restrict . </s>
finally , if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit , I should like to stress that the member of the European Parliament should be give more information on the procedure relate to the implementation of the INTERREG project and , beyond that , of similar initiative . </s>
it would be even good if they be involve to a great extent in the process of frame and implement the programme concern , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authority and even the citizen . </s>
Mr President , first of all , I would like thank the rapporteur of the Equal report , Mrs Stenzel , very warmly for all the effort she have make to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us . </s>
equal be a very difficult programme because it attempt to combine so many old programme and yet aim to view them in a different light , do so with less money than be available in the previous fund . </s>
this be an arduous task . </s>
only , the number of people affect by these programme have not really drop . </s>
this be why it be so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different country or the different component , but especially between the different group list in the programme , and in fact this be what have preoccupy us to date . </s>
comment be make here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another . </s>
I , for my part , have focus on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and I have to say that their position could well have be overlook altogether if it have not be for the European Parliament devote special attention to them . </s>
although a few other group have be mention , it be the Member States , in particular , which be on the lookout . </s>
for example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugee . </s>
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance be strike between these different group . </s>
it should not be the case that one Member State , under the pretext of call on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group . </s>
I think that this will have to be monitor closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer have warn us so vehemently , to wit , that vested interest will emerge and that people will think that the money be theirs to spend . </s>
this be not the case ! </s>
it have to be redistribute time and again . </s>
it should be use for innovative project and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister 's treasury fund . </s>
that be not the intention and that be an important point that we need to bear in mind here . </s>
I believe that the remain problem that we have face within this Parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it be so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solve . </s>
as far as the Commission be concern , I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that be be conclude here in this Parliament , mainly with a view to reach a balance . </s>
I would just like to underline this - the situation be , of course , a little precarious - Parliament have , for the sake of convenience and safety , place the equal programme on the back burner for the time be , so that Parliament have yet to be persuade of the way the fund be to be distribute . </s>
I believe that this be actually a good thing . </s>
the position of Parliament in this whole procedure be somewhat unclear . </s>
the Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that be exactly why this back burner be extremely useful . </s>
Mr President , there be no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promote effort to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union . </s>
however , I should like to stress INTERREG 's particular importance for the Balkan area , where political development and hostility over the past few year have have major economic repercussion for neighbour country and especially for my own country , Greece , which be the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula . </s>
for Greece , for the neighbour country Italy and Austria , but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bring political stability , be a vitally important matter . </s>
so far , some Balkan country have receive aid from the Phare and Obnova programme , while other have not . </s>
during the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding have be provide for from new financial instrument and regulation , such as ISPA and Sapard , it be consider absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strand of INTERREG with other financial aid to third country . </s>
accordingly , we welcome the related reference in Chapter 7 of the European Commission 's propose general guideline for INTERREG . </s>
the effort to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programme equally , and I say that because in the Meda programme during the last period some problem arise which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third country participate in that programme . </s>
I should like to end by say that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zone have take no account of the Mediterranean 's geographical peculiarity , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island region . </s>
we therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next come up for review . </s>
I end by stress the need for the European Union to persist with such initiative , which strive to eliminate inequality between our region , and to foster their harmonious development . </s>
and since this be St. Valentine 's day , as a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European region which need that love . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angle : preservation of job , stewardship of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that be of the utmost importance . </s>
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assure . </s>
we can observe the consequence of migration from the countryside in several area of the Alps and they be devastating . </s>
but I warn against use these programme to take urban culture to the countryside . </s>
and neither should we create structure which be reliant on subsidy and which will be dependent on them forevermore . </s>
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which have , since it gain new currency , become relatively devoid of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what be need , amongst other thing , be an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture . </s>
the investment need to be visionary . </s>
young , creative individual must be make to feel an attachment to the countryside . </s>
if they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more . </s>
none of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate , all-round distribution , and the pilot project need to act , as it be , like avalanche and trigger other similar project . </s>
I would be in favour of support self-contained cycle of project and , even though Leader I and Leader II may have have shortcoming here and there , overall they be certainly positive . </s>
I should like to ask that we consider grant derogation not only in the Nordic country but also for mountainous area - the Alps , the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada , from where I have just return - in respect of population size and density . </s>
Mr President , I want to talk about the Equal report , especially the issue of the policy on refugee . </s>
last week , we have a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian government . </s>
today , we be already discuss the Austrian coalition government 's policy on refugee because Mrs Stenzel , who be the author of the Equal report , of course represent Austria 's govern conservative party and its policy . </s>
the most startling aspect of her original report be that she want to limit aid to the small group of refugee cover by the Geneva Convention , that be to say so-called quota refugee or UN refugee . </s>
in actual fact , it be the other refugee , namely those outside the quota and those not cover by UN aid , who need aid the most . </s>
the Committee reject this discriminatory proposal and decide that all refugee should have a place on the equal programme on identical condition . </s>
some member of the Committee , however , support Mrs Stenzel 's proposal and wording . </s>
as I see it , this mean that Mr Haider 's politics be already cast their shadow over this Parliament . </s>
it be therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establish the fact that all refugee be to have a place on the Equal programme . </s>
I want , finally , to say that I have certain misgiving last week when we discuss the formation of the Austrian government but , when it come to discuss and criticise its policy on refugee , I have no misgiving . </s>
I hope that the Chamber will be just as commit this time . </s>
Mr President , during the last Eu Financial Perspective from @card@ to @card@ , when there be @card@ different initiative in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme be an important initiative . </s>
the fact that the next round of Structural Funds @card@ include the INTERREG initiative be I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which be attach to it by national Eu Member States . </s>
the INTERREG I programme between @card@ and @card@ and the INTERREG II programme between @card@ and @card@ have prove an absolute success in term of bridge closer social and economic development between border Member States . </s>
come from the border county in the north-west of Ireland , I have see over the year the important role which INTERREG I and II have play and I be delight to welcome INTERREG III . </s>
the Commission be allocate @card@ million pound towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spend on continue the development of cross-border economic project between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . </s>
the European Union have play a key role in develop the border county region in Ireland over the year . </s>
the European Union be the single large contributor , with @card@ million pound to the International Fund for Ireland . </s>
the European Union contribute @card@ % of the peace and reconciliation programme . </s>
all in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the peace and reconciliation programme have all play an important role in the develop peace process . </s>
Mr President , I be take the floor to speak about INTERREG , but I shall confine myself to a few criticism , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time . </s>
we have all speak favourably of this programme 's confirmation and of the extension of the sector it cover to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation . </s>
however , this do not blind us to the fact that the majority of resource - @card@ % - will be reserve for cross-border cooperation , for INTERREG IIIA . </s>
therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current area of cooperation in this strand , regard the selection of eligible region , be wrong and contradictory . </s>
we hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament 's position in practical term , and not just with a formal tribute . </s>
cross-border cooperation continue almost exclusively to be an issue concern landlocked area and , where exception have be make for maritime area , their selection be not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policy . </s>
this discrimination be much more serious for island that have a regional status that can only be link to area of an exclusively maritime nature . </s>
this be in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignore Article @card@ of the Treaty on island region with regard to cohesion policy . </s>
more serious still be the fact that this be occur while ignore the new situation associate with the approach that have be adopt towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of region such as Malta . </s>
this have give rise to the proposal we be make to at least extend the region eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian province which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the region of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan region . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I should like to express the satisfaction I have in note that the most remote region , include the French overseas department , have receive some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative , open up new perspective for their cooperation with other country in their geographical area , even though it be true that more could have be expect , particularly with regard to access to the various strand . </s>
for a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our region have fix their attention on the European mainland , ignore and even scorn their close neighbour . </s>
that time be now past . </s>
our region have become aware of belong to an environment that they be connect to , not only in geographical term but also in term of their culture and the history of their people , hence the intensely express aspiration to become more deeply root in this environment . </s>
this increase awareness do not , however , affect identity alone . </s>
it be foster by a fair appraisal of our asset . </s>
so , for example , the island of Réunion be locate on a trade axis between the country of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia . </s>
it can afford to remain outside the regional alliance be forge in this area , lest it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same apply to our region in the Caribbean . </s>
at last we be convince that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbour country the know-how which we have gain thank to the operation of the European structural fund . </s>
INTERREG appropriation may be use to make our region into veritable European Union bridgehead into these geographical area , give it worldwide scope . </s>
I be count on the Commission , and specifically on you , Commissioner , to allocate adequate resource for effective action . </s>
Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibility for increase trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern be that the proposal offer few opportunity in this respect for maritime than for other area . </s>
I understand the Commission 's own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation . </s>
Nonetheless , there be many maritime area between which link be already establish . </s>
various local authority around the North Sea provide a prime example of this . </s>
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation . </s>
in consequence , I seek some small adjustment to the guideline to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the way in which the interest of maritime area can fall between strand a and strand B. these adjustment include clarify the possibility for cooperation between maritime area and permit great development of practical and visible project , particularly those of an infrastructural kind . </s>
such measure will put maritime and insular area on an equal footing with other area of the Eu . </s>
I hope for their adoption . </s>
Mr President , our group welcome the horizontal thrust of the Equal initiative so that , if you be a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to choose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problem , rather than be define as the problem . </s>
There be a lot of expertise within the relevant organisation which deserve to be share . </s>
we also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of good practice for the tighten up of the transnational level . </s>
we be concern , therefore , as other have say , at the number of amendment which seek to exclude even further some of society 's most exclude , by aim for a very narrow definition of &quot; refugee &quot; . </s>
my group will not be support those amendment . </s>
we be also concern at the number of amendment which , in seek to introduce great flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obscure responsibility for the management of the Equal initiative . </s>
Mr President , I be very please to see Urban orientate towards a more integrated approach which attempt to solve interrelate problem . </s>
yet , there be some risk of dilution of effort . </s>
if we pursue too many objective , our overall effectiveness suffer . </s>
of course , every instance of a deprive urban area be a separate case . </s>
but there be a common factor , a hard core , comprise unemployment , the resignation or withdrawal of public service and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprise , both commercial and other kind . </s>
I would wish Urban to be orientate mainly towards provide answer to those cause of urban deprivation . </s>
for this , of course , central policy must interact and be coordinate with development policy , so that the latter too can be reorientate and can work synergistically with the objective of any Urban programme implement in our country , and so that it be not just use them as an alibi for its own shortcoming . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I shall confine my observation to Mr Decourrière 's report . </s>
the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme be an extremely important tool in term of the development and regional planning of European territory , most particularly with reference to effectively take into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying region . </s>
INTERREG must , therefore , be an instrument promote territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory . </s>
it be obvious to me that the regional and local authority , and their representative body , the Committee of the region and , of course , the European Parliament should have be involve in the clear way possible and at the early possible opportunity frame this programme . </s>
indeed , I be force to observe that this be not the case when the Commission draw up its communication , publish on @card@ October last year . </s>
even though I approve of the general guideline of INTERREG III , I feel it be extremely important to ensure good coordination between this programme , finance by the ERDF , and the other external cooperation fund , include in particular the European Development Fund , intend for ACP country . </s>
in this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopt one of my amendment add the EDF to the list of these fund . </s>
the most remote region , particularly the four French overseas department , must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund , in turn , cooperation project with their ACP neighbour in their respective geographical area . </s>
furthermore , I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunity that have be offer to the most remote and island region accord to the guideline put forward in the communication . </s>
it be essential for these region to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III , just like all the other region in the Union , especially now that the Regis programme dedicate to such isolated region have be drop . </s>
finally , in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocate to strand C , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offer the Community be undeniable . </s>
Mr President , my start point be the equal report and equality between man and woman , although I must admit that it be sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which have a feeling of déjà vu about it when you be my age , in any case . </s>
unfortunately , it be necessary to point out again that we do not have equality . </s>
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to change in other area , however . </s>
for me , equality certainly do not mean that both party to a marriage work the whole time and hand the child over to a nanny , alias an immigrant who have not have the opportunity to obtain another job . </s>
if that be the case , we have not progress one little bit since pagan time . </s>
no , equality mean that we all participate in both work life and family life . </s>
unfortunately , development be not move in that direction . </s>
on the contrary . </s>
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contain something very central , i. e. that Equal will be use as a testing ground for develop and promote new way of deliver employment policy . </s>
one can only hope that it succeed . </s>
I should just like to say , in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , that if I be not here when the Commission respond - not that I have ask any specific question , but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission have be pay attention - then that be because the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities be meet to discuss woman in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate be go on . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , those who work on rural area know that , of the programme which the European Union have manage , the Leader programme , both Leader I and Leader II , be one of its success storey , and I hope that the same will be true of Leader + . </s>
One of the reason why it have be so successful be that the basic concept of the Leader programme arouse substantial interest in activity amongst the population concern . </s>
I be glad that Leader + be to remain true to this underlie concept . </s>
There be a problem , however , which we need to address together . </s>
because Leader be a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach , a huge number of idea have come to fruition in recent year through Leader I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once be . </s>
and because of the programme 's success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be drop from Leader . </s>
that be why , where the good Leader project be concern , we need to ensure that those which have prove to be outstanding be not suddenly discontinue ; instead the idea which have prove to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transfer into the standard programme as a reliable , positive component of our support to rural area . </s>
of course this be also the basic idea . </s>
it be to take new idea and try them out in Leader , with the participant on the ground , with the local organisation on the ground , with many non-governmental organisation , with the church , with all those who have help actually to get new idea up and run in rural community . </s>
here we must ensure that the good scheme , those which be really excellent , be then somehow transfer into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work . </s>
my request to the Commission be that it should make sure that the organisation and section of the population which get involve really be accept . </s>
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which be just be form with a view to contribute a new idea and be not yet so well know , push a little on to the sideline , say because of official local or regional policy . </s>
have faith in the successful result which Leader have have so far . </s>
at the beginning it be sometimes a little like chase a rainbow if we say that a plan be too idealistic . </s>
and then when the work and the action start something emerge which the official policy , include ourselves at this level , could never have imagine would suddenly have develop so well . </s>
that be the charm of Leader , and that should please not be lose ! </s>
Mr President , I welcome the equal initiative and the report which highlight the need to distinguish between action to combat discrimination against woman and action to combat discrimination against minority group . </s>
woman be not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as member of minority group as well as because of their gender . </s>
this be why specific action for woman be need , as well as mainstreaming . </s>
the report address this and propose integrate action to achieve equality between woman and man in all aspect of work ; it also recognise the importance of work with local and regional body which be those close to the people to help ensure that all project result be mainstreamed . </s>
the involvement of voluntary and community group will also be an essential ingredient of the Equal initiative and the project . </s>
the development partnership within the thematic field , which be refer to in Amendment No. @card@ , would enable even the small organisation to play a part in the Equal initiative . </s>
my group will be support Amendment No. @card@ . </s>
Mr President , the report under discussion in the House today be doubtless of great importance . </s>
in addition to the objective it be work towards , the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the @card@ programming period lie in its added value from the viewpoint of what be now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean country . </s>
in my opinion , it be precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparity between region and put an end to the isolation of border area . </s>
indeed , these area - and it be right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant country that be go to join the Union . </s>
it be precisely with this in mind that I table some amendment which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have subsequently take up . </s>
they call for the area eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extend to all region of the Adriatic , as well as to the Sicilian province which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which , inexplicably , be not currently include in strand A , Annex 1 . </s>
I be confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament 's position on the matter , in accordance with the Code of Conduct . </s>
There be fundamental advantage for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant country and to support border region . </s>
finally , it be to be hope that great coordination will be seek between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programme , which be significant for external policy , as a vector for great integration and for the joint draft of programme . </s>
Mr President , Commissioners , lady and gentleman , Leader I be an outright success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operator . </s>
it be , I think , regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of Leader II , regard the quality of the project , the quantity of appropriation spend and , most especially , the demotivation of some local operator in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encounter . </s>
I be please to see , however , that under Leader + , new resource have be allocate to help rural territory to develop their potential and to implement the objective of local and sustainable development . </s>
I feel it be important to put special emphasis on try out new way to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment . </s>
the time be now right , I think , to consider include the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation . </s>
it be interesting to note that all rural area may be eligible for Leader II . </s>
Nonetheless , if the opportunity for Member States to determine the area , within the scope of this initiative , remain available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focus of resource and prioritise project in the less prosperous area . </s>
There must , of course , be transparency regard the selection criterion for project and local action group . </s>
I also feel there be ground for ensure , in particular , that the financial channel of States or local authority be not behind the delay in payment which may have cause some LAGs to become bankrupt under Leader II . </s>
Mr President , as a Member from one of the outermost region , I must point out that this be a very special afternoon as far as regional policy be concern , because of the debate on two Community initiative , Urban and INTERREG . </s>
I would like to remind you that these initiative be aim , firstly , in the case of Urban , at improve the quality of life of the citizen who live in the poor part of various European city , and , in the case of INTERREG , at facilitate cohesion and recognise the diversity and potential of the region of the European Union , particularly by include the outermost region in strand B and C. like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it have be exclude from strand IIIA . </s>
with regard to INTERREG , we be very happy that there be a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concern with cooperation . </s>
I would like to thank the rapporteur , particularly Mr Decourrière , for his sensitivity towards the region and for accept our amendment . </s>
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we be make . </s>
Mr President , with regard to the various initiative which we be analyse this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that be , the Urban programme . </s>
it be a fact that we be debate this programme today because the European Parliament insist that this initiative should be maintain . </s>
the Commission propose remove it and other initiative , but Parliament 's proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time lead to the Urban initiative be retain . </s>
I believe that we should be please about this . </s>
but what be the Commission 's argument , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminate the Urban programme ? </s>
its argument be one of priority . </s>
the urban question be so important that we can tighten our belt and undervalue it with a programme which have such a small budget . </s>
today the programme be in place and therefore I believe we have achieve something important , that distinguish mark of the European Union call the Urban programme . </s>
however , I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General , because I think they be absolutely right . </s>
the urban dimension must be incorporate much more deeply in all the structural fund . </s>
the amount of budget require by our city - where @card@ % of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the good and the bad of what we have in Europe , I believe , clearly indicate that the European dimension should be take into account and that this Urban programme should not be use as an excuse not to analyse in detail , not to prioritise and , therefore , not to introduce an infinitely great budgetary contribution into programme which affect the city , by mean of European fund . </s>
therefore , I do not believe I need to restate the number of factor which demand this investment in urban area , factor which be on the agenda , and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect . </s>
in welcome the cross-sectoral approach embody in the new Equal initiative , it be crucial that the programme address the distinct form of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular : physical barrier in the workplace affect those with limited mobility , visual information system which exclude blind worker , work system which effectively close the door on people with learn difficulty or with mental health problem . </s>
organisation of disabled people and disabled people 's non-disabled representative must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making . </s>
that be why this Parliament have put forward paragraph @card@ and @card@ of the resolution , to ensure that Member States can ignore any one target group . </s>
disabled people have too often be leave off the list . </s>
because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority deny respect for their own language and culture - it be necessary as state in paragraph 9 to enable some partnership to be define which be specific to a particular disability or other group . </s>
equal remain crucial also to region like my own , in the east of England , outside the principal fund of Objective I. we have have an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response . </s>
former ADAPT project range from the core project , which have develop new supply chain for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to project to raise standard in small business in Hertfordshire in Essex . </s>
we have see the NOW project help @card@ woman to return to work in Suffolk , many of whom be able to come and share the result of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels . </s>
equal remain important to us because it be precisely in relatively more prosperous region that lower-skilled job be be shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminate against in the labour market . </s>
finally , a word on INTERREG . </s>
it really be quite nonsensical that partnership set up in @card@ be be roll over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional link . </s>
during this period the port of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launch significant new transportation and economic link with partner in the Netherlands . </s>
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new area , particularly on maritime border . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , for the information of the House , Mr President , I should like to make a clarification . </s>
Chancellor Schüssel 's government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government lead by Chancellor Klima . </s>
There be no change in refugee policy in Austria ! </s>
rural area make up over @card@ % of the Eu 's territory and @card@ % of the population live in them . </s>
as a farmer and Member of Parliament , I have always endeavour not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural area as a whole . </s>
I attach particular importance to adopt an integrated approach towards rural development because I be convince that only cooperation link up all people from all walk of life in rural area will permit them to be active and attractive place to live for everyone ; I refer , in short , to the multifunctionality of rural area . </s>
I should like to welcome in particular the new leader + programme because of its comprehensive nature . </s>
in the future it will be possible to have programme not only in the individual zone eligible for structural aid but in all the region of the Eu . </s>
this across-the-board approach be sensible because the programme for rural development be also structure in this way . </s>
in the future , funding will no longer come from three fund but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone . </s>
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programme because the EAGGF be suppose to be an effective financial instrument . </s>
great precision in the selection process will lead to great effectiveness , because the money should not be squander recklessly . </s>
in addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offer an approach towards create an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy . </s>
There be great potential for future job creation in rural area here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospect to people live in the countryside . </s>
that be why policy for rural area be more than a policy just for farmer . </s>
leader + should supplement already exist programme , avoid overlap and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which be as comprehensive as possible . </s>
in this way , Leader + can , together with the programme under Regulation ( EC ) No @card@ / @card@ , consolidate the second pillar of the cap even more effectively and produce the well possible benefit for the whole of the countryside . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I be not always proud of the fuss that go on here in Parliament , but the Urban programme be one of the good example of our work : it be create follow an initiative in Parliament . </s>
the Commission would have abolish Urban , but this time Parliament draw the longer straw . </s>
it be good that Urban be to continue , as it have have good result at local level . </s>
the problem in Europe 's urban area be get worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission . </s>
the majority of the population of Europe live in city , and their problem be among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matter in themselves . </s>
There be an immense risk of exclusion . </s>
in many city in France and England there be now slum , breed ground for many sort of problem . </s>
none of us want South American type favelas in Europe . </s>
we have to act now , before it be too late . </s>
our city be also of decisive importance for Europe 's economy . </s>
we always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy do not support the individual sufficiently , nor be it sufficiently dynamic . </s>
the economy have to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problem of our fellow-citizens and our environment . </s>
this be not policy ; it be life 's simple logic . </s>
it be good that spending have become focus , as otherwise the buckshot get scatter to the four wind . </s>
now we have to concentrate on solve problem in small and middle-size town and city , as they do not have enough resource . </s>
in this way we will also be able to speed up matter in surround rural area ; it be often forget that urban and rural problem in fact go hand in hand . </s>
the basis for all this be that we should be encourage individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begin by the individual will help revitalise an area internally . </s>
grant fund without an economy that can stand on its own two foot be like carry water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again . </s>
Mr President , with the implementation of INTERREG III , European cooperation policy be enter a new phase . </s>
our attention be no longer focus exclusively on internal border but also on external one . </s>
in the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the European Union need instrument that will allow it to strengthen its link and communication channel with neighbour region , particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe . </s>
the Union 's border must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation . </s>
by mean of amendment adopt in committee , Parliament have try to supplement the Commission 's work , by include new element in the list of area target for aid , and in particular external border area and maritime border area in Southern Europe . </s>
in its draft guideline , the Commission acknowledge that these border require great attention than they do in the past . </s>
this be on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of great integration with the Mediterranean country . </s>
as President Prodi too mention when outline the strategic objective for the period @card@ , boost the Barcelona process be a priority for the Union , and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective . </s>
in congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work , we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposal Parliament have put forward , in accordance with the commitment make under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policy , and that it will confirm , with fitting amendment , the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relation with neighbour country . </s>
Mr President , from this year until the year @card@ around EUR @card@ billion be available for the structural fund , but only 5 ¾ % be set aside for the Community initiative , INTERREG , Leader , Urban and Equal . </s>
that be a reduction of 3 ¾ % compare with the previous CIs . </s>
no more than EUR @card@ billion be provide for Equal , as Mrs Stenzel 's balanced report make clear . </s>
this make the large number of amendment and far too long a wish list of possible task all the more astonishing . </s>
How be priority suppose to be set here ? </s>
There be agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequality on the labour market should be reduce . </s>
transnational strategy be intend to make it possible for disadvantaged group to have access to job . </s>
I have no sympathy for amendment once again back the Taos . </s>
criticism of the previous Commission 's work be particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these Technical Assistance office . </s>
our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs be , after all , in overall charge of analyse considerable shortcoming and failure to carry out check in case relate to Leonardo . </s>
the Commission can therefore be relieve of direct responsibility or the task of carry out inspection under Equal either . </s>
it can only approve Member States ' proposal if they fulfil all the criterion : firstly , integration through sectoral and geographical development partnership , whereby the employment policy guideline need to be take into account ; secondly , the systematic involvement of the operator concern - the local , regional and national authority , training institution , university , NGOs , the two side of industry and the private sector - with the aim of create a durable partnership , and thirdly , method and model of indisputably innovative character . </s>
the Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promote ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of result and of the effective communication of good practice . </s>
only then will it be possible for the desire multiplier effect to be achieve . </s>
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposal on the budget line to promote the cap . </s>
on @card@ October @card@ the European Commission adopt a proposal to ensure that a legal basis be give to the budget line inform the public about the cap . </s>
this proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget head B1-382 . </s>
action which promote understanding between young farmer and the Eu and also create strong link with Eu candidate country and the outside world be important . </s>
therefore I be put forward these amendment to Parliament to give its support to the contribution of this type of programme . </s>
give the need to encourage young farmer to continue in farm it be vitally important that they be well-informed about development in the common agricultural policy . </s>
inform and train young farmer at European level be vitally important . </s>
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrate on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmer . </s>
regard information and training , in the past this budget line have be allocate for information , communication and training . </s>
but the Commission be now propose that training should no longer be include . </s>
I feel that training should be include where it provide relevant information at European level about the cap . </s>
such European training be one element in ensure that young farmer have the necessary knowledge of the cap to make sound business decision for the future . </s>
therefore I be put forward three amendment . </s>
I would urge Parliament to support them . </s>
Mr President , I be take the floor to express my opinion , draw from my experience of municipal administration , that the Urban project should , or rather must , have a threefold purpose : firstly , to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic , old and perhaps dilapidated area of city . </s>
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centre , within these old quarter of our city . </s>
There be little point in have street which be now wonderfully light , with new pavement , with newly paved road surface , all whitewash and beautiful , if we be not able to fill them with activity and , therefore , employment . </s>
I would like to make it clear that it be not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operator , but rather also of select those project which be aim at employment , or to put it another way , project which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of job . </s>
thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the project should principally be aim at the complete rehabilitation of people and family , because man be not make for the law , but rather law be make for man . </s>
these area of our city be often home to single-parent family , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and family face difficulty ; sometimes they be family which have break down and which be exclude from mainstream society . </s>
these people live in area which should benefit from these project . </s>
if we have success in this threefold sense , I believe that these family , these people , these European citizen , will believe more in Europe , and this seem to me to be very important because , ultimately , the city will increasingly come to play a lead role in European life . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , it be clear today that agriculture alone be less and less able to sustain community in rural area , particularly in the case of young people . </s>
the recently publish 6th periodic report on the European region demonstrate this clearly by reveal that the @card@ most heavily agricultural region in the European Union have the high rate of unemployment , in addition to their traditional problem of an age population and desertification . </s>
that be why the Commission gradually and unfortunately too slowly have be launch initiative which will in time balance out or complement the cap , by increase the coverage of all the endogenous resource in rural area and by utilise them for initiative and investment which will increase prosperity and employment for community , farming or other community . </s>
that be the intention of the recent policy on rural development launch in the Agenda @card@ reform . </s>
in particular , that be the intention of the Community Leader initiative which be launch as Leader I and Leader II , in @card@ and @card@ , and which continue today through Leader + . </s>
I would consequently like to highlight three issue : first of all , it be crucial that the choice of local action group responsible for organise and operate the project should not be influence by politics . </s>
instead , the choice should be make solely on the basis of the project ' merit . </s>
preference should be give to those project most closely involve with private organisation , more than @card@ % of which should never be make up of LAG partner . </s>
the second issue be that , in action for cooperation between LAGs and similar organisation in third country , the Commission 's original text must be respect - item @card@ , not the restrictive version by the Star Committee , which be produce without the consent of this Parliament . </s>
I have therefore propose an amendment to this effect , which the Committee on Agriculture have adopt and which I hope the plenary will also adopt . </s>
thirdly , I would like to remind you that after @card@ , Leader must no longer merely be a Community pilot initiative but must form a rural development component of the cap , which I think should be call the &quot; common agricultural , regional and rural policy &quot; . </s>
I would like to congratulate Mr Procacci on his excellent report . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) Mr President , before my friend and fellow commissioner , Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who be responsible for these four Community initiative have have the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of Urban and INTERREG , which many of you have bring up and discuss . </s>
straight away I should like to express my thank to the rapporteur from the committee , from all the committee , but also to the speaker for the group and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speech and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiative . </s>
this be particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy say about Urban . </s>
I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she present but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her , for all you owe her as far as this be initiative , as well as , more generally , all we owe Parliament . </s>
I be mindful of the fact that it be in fact the European Parliament which make the political decision and support the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban area in difficulty , in favour of sustainable urban development , involve at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspect simultaneously . </s>
some other point of agreement highlight in Mrs McCarthy 's report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminate result and increase the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increase role of local authority in the planning and management of the programme , on the basis of a real partnership . </s>
have mention the fundamental point of agreement between the Commission 's proposal and Parliament and , have stress my great interest in hear the various contribution , I should like to answer a few of the criticism and a few of the suggestion which have be make , with apology if I can attribute each of the question to the speaker by name . </s>
I think however that you will all recognise your own comment . </s>
firstly on the subject of the Urban programme and the maximum threshold of fifty town , which a number of you term arbitrary . </s>
I can understand your concern . </s>
I have therefore ask my service to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of town eligible under the Urban programme conditional upon certain guarantee , firstly on concentration - I be think particularly of the target area which must have a minimum of @card@ @card@ or , in exceptional case , @card@ @card@ inhabitant - and also upon the critical mass of funding : we must keep to EUR @card@ per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear , and so that it do not resemble a sort of scatter of resource which would have no real impact either for citizen or for municipality . </s>
that be my initial response to the threshold question . </s>
regard a second matter , now , relate to the additional criterion , which should be take into consideration in select disadvantaged area . </s>
here , too , I be willing to demonstrate great flexibility and to consider other relevant criterion in addition to the Community criterion give in point @card@ of the guidance project . </s>
third point : specific measure in favour of some social group - some speaker mention them - woman , but also immigrant and refugee , must be envisage . </s>
this concern , lady and gentleman , lie at the very heart of our Urban initiative , and I be willing to rewrite the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clear yet . </s>
regard Urban , I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure . </s>
some speaker want it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in term of the project and funding . </s>
lady and gentleman , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zone or municipality eligible for Urban be primarily the responsibility of the Member States . </s>
as far as the Commission be concern , it be willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we can give up the practice of check the relevance and quality of the propose programme , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we do . </s>
a second observation , the time limit for the submission of programme and the possibility of submit a plan supplement in addition to the programme . </s>
I have no objection to the idea of submit a planning supplement jointly with the main programme . </s>
this can , however , be ground for an extension of the original time limit . </s>
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme be six month . </s>
this time limit , which indeed be identical to the one we grant for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs , should normally be adequate , I feel , for draw up a programme , which do not mean that the project can be define at a late stage . </s>
with regard to Urban , I should like to conclude with a final observation . </s>
One of you express a wish that these urban issue should not be confine to the Urban initiative . </s>
I agree completely . </s>
I myself express my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning , a concern to which I devote myself , that in the DOCUPs and the CSF in the planning which we be currently start to negotiate , my concern , as I say , that , apart from the Urban initiative , urban issue should be address in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programme , and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issue and also our commitment to include them , beyond the scope of Urban , in all structural fund programming . </s>
but , as for the future , since we must look ahead , I be extremely concern to see how Urban be go to be implement in practical term , and also to see what our experience will be and what lesson we can learn , because plainly these urban issue be go to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspective , a new European regional planning policy . </s>
I be not forget , and we can forget , that @card@ % of the citizen of Europe today live in town and that be why this Urban instrument be extremely important . </s>
let me repeat what I have say , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issue in all structural fund programming . </s>
I should now , Mr President , like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur , Francis Decourrière , in the same way that I thank Arlene McCarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work . </s>
he stress a number of point , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you do too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation , with its three strand , cross-border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the community provide by INTERREG , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural fund , and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programme and operation ; the importance of common structure and what , in discuss another debate which begin today , the Intergovernmental Conference , I term the common European spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with INTERREG , thank to INTERREG , be a way to strengthen common spirit through common structure for the implementation of programme with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guarantee the active participation of all the local and regional authority concern as well as private sector association and economic and social partner . </s>
have make these general observation , I should like to focus on your main comment with regard to INTERREG . </s>
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative . </s>
you comment that these guideline be adopt at too late a date , stress , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programme will be interrupt . </s>
it be true , I admit it , and you be well aware of the reason , lady and gentleman . </s>
There be a delay in adopt the INTERREG guideline in March or April @card@ . </s>
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do . </s>
I note , however , that the Member States and the region be already actively prepare the programme for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project be distribute over three month ago now . </s>
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accept from the date that programme be present and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January , if the programme be present before @card@ April . </s>
so much for the first comment . </s>
as to the second comment : regard the non-comprehensive list of measure eligible under strand B , I wish to inform you , to confirm , that I have ask the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subject , particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized business and of cultural heritage , in the list of scheme eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be consider as a comprehensive one . </s>
third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand C. The Commission share the observation make by this House regard the importance of strand C , interregional cooperation . </s>
as your rapporteur have request , I shall send you the detailed information regard the system for the implementation of this strand . </s>
fourth observation : the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office . </s>
as you request , I have decide to remove all reference to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing system . </s>
but , lady and gentleman , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a Tao at a late date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of official ' job need to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and I can keep redeploy the same staff indefinitely , at a time when our duty be increase with the pre-accession structural instrument ( ISPA ) and in order to ensure that , the Community appropriation for which I be responsible , often in partnership or on term of coresponsibility with Member States , be monitor well , with discipline and transparency . </s>
now to the implementation of INTERREG , a subject mention by many of you , and the potential eligibility under strand a , ' cross-border cooperation ' , of scheme in the Adriatic , on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote region , the Commission , lady and gentleman , understand your concern and take note of your request on these various point . </s>
I therefore intend to amend the guideline in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B : ' integrated cooperation of maritime and island region ' , so as to cover , in what I think be an appropriate fashion the various opportunity for cooperation between these region . </s>
in addition to this one overture there be a second which we have already suggest to the Member States : great financial flexibility between strand a and strand B. Thank to these two overture , especially the first , I can say that the Commission be willing to examine the case of Italian region and region of third country around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG , and with other instrument too , as soon as they become available . </s>
I have decide , in the end , that the most remote region , to which I attach particular importance , will be give special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improve their link with their neighbour and other Member State region . </s>
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean . </s>
All this should make it possible for us , apart from the objective 1 appropriation and also with them , to confirm the role of ' active frontier ' of the Union . </s>
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote region of the Union be actually active frontier of the Union , even if , or precisely because , they be remote and locate in other region of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear . </s>
another point : the coordination between INTERREG , Phare , TACIS and Meda . </s>
it be true , once again , and I accept this objectively , that there be still real legal problem . </s>
I do not want to minimise these , but progress be be make as far as strand a cooperation with candidate country be concern , even if the problem relate to the management procedure and to the scale of the project still remain . </s>
the Commission must continue along these line . </s>
I be make a personal commitment to do so . </s>
an initial joint PHARE / CIP committee be to meet in February to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this , together with my colleague and fellow Commissioners Verheugen , Patten and Poul Nielson . </s>
finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you comment . </s>
it go without say that the Commission will adhere to the term of Article @card@ of the general regulation regard technical assistance , if it be indeed assistance intend to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general . </s>
accord to the general regulation , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be propose under Article @card@ , and not Article @card@ . </s>
this mean that the ceiling of @card@ % mention in Article @card@ do not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance . </s>
I attach great importance , lady and gentleman , in a spirit of discipline and transparency , to our nonetheless retain some financial strand for matter relate to the exchange of experience and information , and not to propaganda , and to the implementation of network ensure good communication of good practice within the Union . </s>
my conclusion regard INTERREG , Mr President , lady and gentleman , be that these Community initiative for which I be responsible fulfil a real need and everything that have be say be proof of this . </s>
they also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union . </s>
the Commission attach the great importance to this , just as you yourselves do . </s>
I remain at your service in order , when the time come , to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you inform regularly as to the implementation of these initiative in the course of the new planning . </s>
repeat my thank to each and every one of you , and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière , I should like to point out that these two initiative lie within a financial framework with which you be familiar : only EUR @card@ million for Urban , but this be good than nothing ; EUR 4 billion @card@ million for INTERREG . </s>
so we be work within this framework and not outside it . </s>
on the subject of these two initiative , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regard regional planning and on future financial perspective , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committee . </s>
Everything that I have just say , lady and gentleman , demonstrate that the Commission be resolve to take the view of Parliament into account . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report . </s>
however , I should also like to extend thank to the various committee involve and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have give the leader + initiative . </s>
this initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original idea , idea which it be then intend should at a late stage be incorporate in the general programme as model . </s>
I be also please that Parliament essentially support the Commission 's view that Leader + should be apply in all rural area , that overriding priority should be introduce and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural area should be encourage . </s>
in addition , I note that Parliament share the Commission 's view that the preferred form for implement Leader + be the use of global grant . </s>
turn now to some of the individual question raise here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the wide possible partnership and participation in Leader + . </s>
the various group , be they environmental organisation or group concern with employment , have the possibility of take part in draft the Commission directive . </s>
and there will not be less fund available than in the current period either ; there will be more . </s>
I should also like to remind you that the idea of set up an observatory be nothing new . </s>
There be also an observatory under Leader I and Leader II . </s>
it have one purpose only and that be precisely to maintain active networking between the individual Leader group . </s>
the cost of this observatory be not permit to exceed 2 % of the Leader budget . </s>
as far as the possibility of have project contain training initiative be concern , I might point out that this be precisely a point which we have now integrate into the new rural development policy , which mean , in our view , that it be no longer necessary to do this as part of Leader . </s>
I now come to the content of the report . </s>
in point @card@ , Parliament call on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on Leader II immediately . </s>
I should simply like to point out that this do not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it be still possible - and in fact will be until the end of @card@ - for Leader II fund to be disburse . </s>
we therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme 's conclusion before carry out the evaluation . </s>
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it . </s>
in point @card@ , Parliament suggest publish a compendium of example of successful initiative . </s>
in response I can only say that this already exist . </s>
it have already be compile by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who be interested . </s>
in point @card@ , Parliament stress that the guideline in Leader + now need to be adopt quickly so that the programme can start . </s>
I can only fully share your concern . </s>
as soon as the opinion be adopt here in Parliament , the guideline for Leader + will again be present to the Star Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they give on @card@ November . </s>
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guideline in March or April . </s>
and as soon as these be publish in the Official Journal the remain month - in fact six month - can be use to submit Leader + programme . </s>
I believe that it be important to point out one thing : expenditure effect under Leader + be eligible from the time that the Commission programme start run . </s>
for all programme submit before @card@ April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January . </s>
finally , under point @card@ the motion for a resolution contain seven specific proposal for amendment to the guideline . </s>
have give them thorough consideration , I can tell you that the proposal make under paragraph 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 be acceptable to the Commission and be adopt . </s>
the proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accept because it reaffirm that the time allow for approve programme under Leader + be a maximum of 5 month . </s>
the amendment propose under paragraph 1 have , in our view , be overtake by event because , follow consultation with the representative of the Member States in the Star Committee , this point have already be reword along the line propose by Parliament . </s>
that therefore leave only the amendment propose under paragraph 3 . </s>
the Commission can only endorse this request because of course it correspond precisely to what the Commission itself have originally propose . </s>
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action group and similar group in third country go too far for the Member States . </s>
an amendment be therefore make in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament 's concern in the revise version and table the guideline in that form . </s>
it will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this . </s>
I will comment briefly on the @card@ amendment table . </s>
here there be only three which the Commission can accept , Amendments Nos 3 , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
it can accept all of the other either in full or in essence . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , it be an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we be debate the equal initiative in the European Parliament just at this time . </s>
recently , because of political development in Austria , there be grow unease within Europe . </s>
political demonstration be take place as well as political dialogue . </s>
it be worth stress that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policy . </s>
we need specific proposal , both for legislation and for action programme associate with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair society . </s>
so I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committee to appoint their rapporteur so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible . </s>
I now come to the equal initiative , which be , of course , base on Article @card@ . </s>
the Equal initiative relate to all form of discrimination within the meaning of Article @card@ , namely the fight against discrimination base on race , gender , age , and special need . </s>
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel , because her effort to reach agreement on the Equal initiative have prove exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committee involve view the issue in a different light and because it be a very sensitive political issue . </s>
the first comment , which have be make by many other too , be whether woman should be mention separately . </s>
I agree that Article @card@ contain something we have express our disagreement about , but that be how the Treaty stand right now and among the category of type of discrimination , discrimination on the ground of gender hold equal place . </s>
so on the basis of the Treaty as it stand today , the Equal initiative be structure in that way . </s>
I would like to remind you , however , that there be a special axis for the employment strategy which relate to woman and that a special programme be be prepare , the fifth programme for equality between man and woman . </s>
I have classify the issue raise by the honourable member into four group . </s>
firstly , the enlargement of the thematic area . </s>
as in employment strategy , there be four thematic area : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunity , and we agree that those thematic area should be enlarge in line with the European Parliament 's proposal . </s>
To answer the concern whether there be a risk that a country might concentrate all the fund on one of the category suffer discrimination , I will say that the initiative state clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that be suffer discrimination . </s>
the second subject be flexibility and simplification . </s>
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative be indeed very difficult and hard to understand . </s>
that be why the service be already try to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp . </s>
as regard the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnership and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kind of group would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector . </s>
this would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular need . </s>
of course , a prerequisite for that be cooperation between the Member States , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience . </s>
finally , I would like to mention technical assistance . </s>
we be try to arrange that there will be four category for which funding be available . </s>
first , funding for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance . </s>
since there have be great involvement and concern about how technical assistance be to be provide , we must say that external office will be use . </s>
as Mr Barnier too point out , it be impossible for all the work previously do by external collaborator to be do now by the Commission 's staff . </s>
the aim at national and European level be to establish large action group by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance be to be request . </s>
we would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitor and appraise . </s>
I want to stress that it be extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reason of political timing and because we believe that it be important that it should begin as plan , in other word , we must be absolutely ready by the end of @card@ . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteur should be quickly appoint for the file you mention to my colleague in the Bureau and to the appropriate committee . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon . </s>
( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) approval of the Minutes of the two previous sitting the Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 3 February and Monday @card@ February have be distribute . </s>
the Minutes of 3 February be originally distribute in Brussels so perhaps this be why some member do not receive them . </s>
be there any comment ? </s>
( the Minutes be approve ) Madam President , my habit be always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoon at @card@ p. m. yesterday it be impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here , because the @card@ P. M. Air France flight , which normally bring us here , be cancel , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrive very late . </s>
if Air France insist on boycott the European Parliament , we should take measure to prevent this occur again . </s>
thank you , Mr Medina Ortega . </s>
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation . </s>
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authority of both Air France and the French government ? </s>
this situation really can continue and we must therefore protest most strongly . </s>
madam President , I have the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday . </s>
I feel that the French authority - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connection with all the capital of the Union . </s>
absolutely , Mr Napolitano . </s>
thank you . </s>
madam President , off the subject of aeroplane delay , I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , Caroline Lucas , who be a British Member . </s>
she could not be here because she be arrest yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow . </s>
although her identity be note and her position as a Member of the European Parliament be very apparent , she be still hold in custody all day . </s>
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authority in order to ensure that this do not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receive an apology . </s>
I have write to you in this respect together with my colleague , Mrs Hautala . </s>
thank you , Mr Lannoye . </s>
I have receive your letter and have already contact the British Permanent Representative . </s>
madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today 's vote which I start to make yesterday during the debate on the Equal report . </s>
I should like the vote on the Community Equal initiative to be postpone because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point . </s>
I be optimistic and quite relax and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on Equal . </s>
we just need a bit more time to work out the detail on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postpone from this morning . </s>
madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye make : Mrs Lucas be arrest just outside Glasgow for protest against the Trident base at Faslane . </s>
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest . </s>
I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lucas try to hide behind her parliamentary immunity . </s>
I have also be arrest for protest at Faslane . </s>
I do not hide behind any immunity . </s>
I take the punishment that come to me . </s>
Mrs Lucas should do the same . </s>
madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel have make to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow . </s>
in fact , this initiative be the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , give that it be a major Commission proposal , which refer to the agreement we reach last year , I consider it admissible . </s>
we agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote be admissible in the interest of achieve the great possible agreement between the group , so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broad majority possible . </s>
do anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel 's request , as support by Mrs Ghilardotti ? </s>
if not , then we will proceed to the vote . </s>
( Parliament approve the request ) Madam President , under Rule @card@ ( 4 ) you should be keep inform by political group of any member who have join a new political group or who have leave a political group . </s>
have you receive any notification of any member leave the Group of the European People 's Party or do the Austrian People 's Party continue to sit in that political group ? </s>
Mr Corbett , I have not receive any notification . </s>
madam President , I be amaze at Mr Corbett 's reaction . </s>
he should find other way of raise his profile than express view on such matter here . </s>
we be solidly with our Austrian friend who have prove to be good European in the past . </s>
they have our full support . </s>
( applause ) agenda with regard to the agenda for Thursday , follow a request make yesterday in plenary , I propose extend the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance by half an hour to @card@ p. m. when the vote will take place . </s>
( Parliament give its assent ) Commission 's strategic objective and legislative programme the next item be the joint debate on the Commission statement on its strategic objective for the come five year and the annual legislative programme for @card@ . </s>
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , a five-year programme be an extremely important undertaking , and this be why I prefer that you be give the unabridged text of the speech , which be available in four language . </s>
To respect my speaking time , I will confine myself to refer only to the broad outline of my programme : a programme for the dawn of a new legislature and a new century , when it be right and proper to see Europe in a broad perspective , a Europe which be currently in a paradoxical situation . </s>
let us remember that for half a century , Europe have provide us with peace , security and freedom and a unite Europe have also contribute to give us a period of unprecedented prosperity . </s>
we be now see the beginning of a strong recovery , which it appear may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we be prudent with our policy . </s>
this recovery be the logical consequence of the effort we have make , but it come at a price : it follow the restructuring of public account in European country , which have keep inflation under control with a policy wisely intend to control cost and increase productivity in a Europe that have begin a vigorous restructuring of its own industry , bank and public service , even though this process be not yet complete and still have a long way to go . </s>
nevertheless , despite these aspect , European citizen be disappoint and concern : by unemployment which be not fall quickly enough ; by a Europe trail behind in technology , and seemingly fall even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which be start to lag a long way behind too ; by the European institution which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the time , start with the Commission itself . </s>
the crisis in the Commission be , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizen , and the low turnout at the European election be a worrying indication of this . </s>
even strong still , however , be the sense of insecurity , the feeling of be unprepared in a new world that be move forwards , a world which be completely change , where globalisation will even end up change our point of reference . </s>
this be not the first time this have happen : Europe be once confront with a similar transformation , an explosion of its market , a change in its point of reference and a different view of the world . </s>
I be refer to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turn everything upside down . </s>
some country - such as France and Spain - manage to meet the challenge , give rise to great nation state ; other country - such as Italy - do not meet this challenge and lose all the headway that they have accumulate during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structure and military organisation , philosophy and literature . </s>
today , Europe be face a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history have be unforgive in the past , it will not be forgive in the present . </s>
in this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation States vanish again , in the wake of globalisation which be create hitherto unprecedented scale and challenge , Europe need to be economically strong , because globalisation demand unity , because every day we hear news of new agreement at world level and news of change at European level too . </s>
but more vital still be a Europe that feel strong in the political arena . </s>
in year past , the single market and the single currency have be the pivotal point of our action , the mainstay of European life . </s>
today , the new frontier of European integration be political frontier : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political value on which our coexistence be base . </s>
the Commission have therefore adopt the strategic programme for @card@ , a programme that be immediately send to the European Parliament and with which you be already familiar , so I will not go into detail about it now . </s>
some of you may find it lack detail , but no political structure set out detailed five-year programme . </s>
this be the European Union , not the Soviet Union . </s>
our programme highlight the major point of reference , the major area for action : firstly , the development of new form of governance for Europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguard and improve quality of life . </s>
these will be our major guideline for action over the next five year . </s>
with regard to the first area - new form of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission have undertake to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issue which be change the structure of the way we interact , the Commission be first of all prepare for a debate ; we will subsequently discuss the content with you ; this will give rise to a policy document , and finally , a legislative document . </s>
this be an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institution and the citizen of Europe . </s>
this White Paper be a response to the challenge that enlargement be force on us , an enlargement that be force us to rethink the working of all our institution , rethink our very policy - all our policy - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number @card@ or @card@ , and what will be the good thing to do at individual State level , at regional level and at local government level . </s>
but it be not only enlargement that be urge us towards this rethink : as I say a few moment ago , it be also economic and political globalisation itself . </s>
we must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us close to the citizen and to encourage everyone to get involve , start with the important issue of the involvement of woman . </s>
One of the main difference in the comparison make recently between Europe and the United States be not so much job mobility or risk capital , as woman 's involvement in economic life , an issue that have much more prominence in the United States than in Europe . </s>
this be a field where Europe have , nevertheless , always be in the vanguard . </s>
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institution - Commission , Parliament , Council - will have to consider their own role and their own policy . </s>
we shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the result of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring @card@ . </s>
it will not be a philosophical paper , but a practical paper , full of focused proposal . </s>
we - the Commission - be the first to know that we must have a total rethink , and we shall therefore do two thing : we be , and will continue to be , fully commit to internal reform , and we shall rethink our policy in detail . </s>
I have ask all the commissioner - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activity that we can forgo . </s>
the Commission must define what its fundamental activity be , what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activity , thereby free up new resource and ensure a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual country , region and local community . </s>
so we shall be free up new resource , but - I fear , and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resource that we be already free up will , in turn , be insufficient in term of allow us to address our new task : I be think of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affair , health issue and environmental matter . </s>
when that time come , when we have use up all our resource , I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resource , but what I be say now be that if we be not give these necessary resource , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duty because the available resource will not be commensurate with the new task that we will be take on . </s>
as for internal reform , you well know how committed my Commission have be to this since day one . </s>
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission do not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform , if it do not become more efficient , if it do not increase efficiency in all sector , start with the sector in which the bad backlog have build up in the past - external aid . </s>
provide aid rapidly , when it be need , save human life ; in many case provide it late be bad than not provide it at all . </s>
when I speak about external aid , my thought immediately turn to the Balkans . </s>
There be cause for hope thank to the commitment of our worker on the ground , an extraordinary commitment give our organisational problem . </s>
my thought also turn to Bernard Kouchner 's effort , of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication , but I also think of new event , such as Croatia , where the situation have change in a few week : the European institution immediately open the way to dialogue with this country and receive the news know full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia 's problem , but more particularly Serbia 's problem be to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia . </s>
this be the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans . </s>
we must increase our efficiency in this area . </s>
we must reopen the Danube to boat . </s>
it be contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these country unable to harness their great resource . </s>
we must decontaminate the river and , in view of this , over the next few day the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be put forward specific plan to monitor this serious problem . </s>
we have do a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulation to speed up procedure . </s>
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more . </s>
we must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union ; we must contribute to build infrastructural link that will end its centuries-old isolation ; we must intensify effort to build a democratic , pluralist society in these country with institution , public structure , police force and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these country to work together in the context of a unite region , as regard both politics and the economy . </s>
if we do not do this , we shall have fail in our duty . </s>
remember that the Marshall Plan be not effective simply because of the scale of its resource : it be even more effective because it make us Europeans work together towards a new horizon ; it give us a fresh outlook in term of our politics and our economy . </s>
this be what we need to do for the Balkans . </s>
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ability to take a lead role on the international stage . </s>
we be clearly , once again , return to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom . </s>
we have make many promise in this regard , but I believe we shall succeed in keep our promise even though we have a very delicate path to tread . </s>
indeed , enlargement , which will be with us for our five year in office and beyond - I be refer to the aspiration of applicant country - must hinge on concrete , objective criterion , and also on reassuring public opinion in the country involve and , to an even great degree , public opinion in our own Member States . </s>
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process . </s>
I repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those country that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even great reassurance . </s>
our responsibility do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans . </s>
There be certain other key issue : relation with Ukraine , relation with Russia , relation with neighbour country and more importantly , the important question of relation with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history , and for security and peace in Europe for future generation . </s>
in this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa . </s>
in recent time , Africa have raise hope and have receive offer of help , but nothing tangible have yet be achieve . </s>
in recent year in Africa , we have not see a shift from totalitarian regime to democracy , but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regime . </s>
Africa be , for us , a worrying topic for discussion . </s>
we therefore have another duty at international level , which have already be propose by the Commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problem affect the poor country , not just in term of write off debt , but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poor country in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we have already propose prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice . </s>
we need to provide alternative answer , otherwise episode such as those see in Seattle will be repeat over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe 's positive role in history . </s>
all over the world , Europe 's action must be guide by a deep respect for the principle of freedom and respect for the right of individual and minority . </s>
we should remember that we , the European Union , be a union of minority : we be all a minority within Europe . </s>
There be concern even within the Fifteen , concern which may even surface again in the next decade . </s>
I be refer to the situation in Austria , where the Commission have remain true to its role , be duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union , but also the unwaver guardian of the treaty , ready to punish every minor breach of the principle of democracy , law and respect for minority . </s>
some people have criticise me over the congratulatory message I send to Chancellor Schüssel . </s>
my message to you be : do not take the necessary and proper courtesy of form to mean that I have be less firm in the content . </s>
reread the letter : the reference to the fundamental value of the Union be take - and this be more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty . </s>
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government have ever be remind of these principle by the Commission when they be elect . </s>
this be what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role confer on us by the treaty , but also be unwaver on principle and make judgement base on fact . </s>
last November , the Commission table a proposal for an anti-racism directive . </s>
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental base of our social cohesion . </s>
I will quickly conclude by mention the last two point of our programme : the economy and quality of life . </s>
I have already talk about the economy : we well know which basic ingredient will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more job . </s>
we must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technology ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundary , and develop an appetite for be at the cut edge of science . </s>
the forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issue - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit . </s>
it have take four year for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind . </s>
we be at last holding it and can let this opportunity slip through our finger . </s>
finally , our last commitment be to improve quality of life . </s>
we have open this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector . </s>
the Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrate the press need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment . </s>
the time have come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe . </s>
all too often we find ourselves call for this after a disaster have occur . </s>
I think it would be appropriate to begin think about these thing before disaster happen . </s>
these be the challenge that we - the Commission but also all the other European institution - be face . </s>
How will we judge , lady and gentleman , Madam President , the five year of our mandate ? </s>
How be we go to assess the result of these five year ? </s>
I do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use be the challenge we must take up together . </s>
let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next European election . </s>
if it be high than at the previous election , it will mean that we have successfully meet our challenge . </s>
madam President , lady and gentleman , we be face with all these major political challenge , but precisely because of the recovery that be now underway , we be also face with major opportunity . </s>
this , lady and gentleman , could be the decade of Europe . </s>
indeed , I would say that this must be the decade of Europe . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats welcome this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submit a document so that we could prepare for the debate . </s>
we also welcome the conclusion which we find in this document . </s>
and we welcome the broad outline of the speech which President Prodi have just give . </s>
we read in the conclusion in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major change . </s>
Europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , reunite our continent . </s>
a demanding , ambitious , perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success , Mr President of the Commission . </s>
however , we consider that the present be the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present . </s>
I say that in all earnestness and I have choose my word carefully . </s>
I refer to the current debate on the present conflict in the European Union . </s>
we in the European Union be one Community . </s>
we belong together , even when there be problem . </s>
now be not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , you have represent and defend the European Parliament time and again over recent week . </s>
you have see yourself as the guardian of the treaty , and that be indeed your role . </s>
for that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mention , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you . </s>
( applause ) Mr President of the Commission , our objective be one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century , a democratic Europe which be able to act . </s>
a Europe which defend its value of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and , at the same time , look after its global interest with dignity , patience and convincing self-confidence . </s>
Europe 's message , the European Union 's message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development . </s>
Globalisation give us the chance to shape the world , which be become small and small , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity . </s>
see in this light , globalisation be more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a come together than a segregation , more mutual enrichment than separation . </s>
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans . </s>
Globalisation be not only an economic process , it be also a cultural process , which be why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the clash of civilisation which many be predict , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace . </s>
but we also say : we want to defend this European community of tolerance , which be why a common foreign , security and defence policy be so important . </s>
negotiation with six central European country be start today , bring the European family a step closer together . </s>
we agree with what you say about the Barcelona process . </s>
All the country in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law . </s>
for us , the Group of the European People 's Party and the European democrat , it be not only the reform of the institution of the European union which will be important in the next five year ; it be also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidate the European currency in come year . </s>
we therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact . </s>
we need structural reform in the European economy . </s>
most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pay and people can work as entrepreneur . </s>
it would be Europe 's undoing if we be to end up with just a few multinational and no future for small and medium-sized business in Europe . </s>
( applause ) the Commission have an important role to play here by get a coordinate policy under way with the nation state to reduce taxis so that entrepreneurship pay . </s>
we too want to help put Europe on its foot . </s>
you speak in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity . </s>
we support that . </s>
the nation , region , town and community of Europe will be preserve . </s>
however , there be a current trend - the &quot; fauna , flora , habitat &quot; directive be quote as an example - which , in my country at least , create the impression that association be bypass national and regional institution and submit programme to Brussels and that Brussels be then make decision affect the property of countless agricultural holding in the country of the European Union . </s>
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , allow me to close with these word : as the Group of the European People 's Party and the European democrat , we have every interest in a strong Commission . </s>
if you be persuasive in your action , we all reap the benefit . </s>
in this respect we wish you every success . </s>
however , we be also aware of our role as the Commission 's watchdog . </s>
if we have the merest suspicion that you be fail to safeguard the law of the European Union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this be not the case - , but if European law be infringe then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly , precisely because peace in the European Union be found on this law . </s>
we must preserve this law and peace in the European union if we be to be able to go forth as peacemaker in the world . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , lady and gentleman , first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the Commission 's programme for government - the word President Prodi be so fond of ; as I be -for the whole legislature . </s>
firstly , this be welcome because it explain , to our fellow citizen , what we be intend to do and what we be already do . </s>
we must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future . </s>
we have take almost eleven month - President Prodi be nominate at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme . </s>
this be not entirely President Prodi 's fault . </s>
we be recover from a crisis . </s>
however , I believe that , in the future , it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme . </s>
we be break new ground and do so in complex circumstance . </s>
President Prodi begin his speech by talk of a paradoxical situation , a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world : we be at the dawn of a new secular millennium , dominate by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance , and we be live through a genuine change of epoch . </s>
however , to focus on the European union as it be today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in Spanish , bring to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing be that the European union be provide with a good government , and , since President Prodi always defend his home town , Bologna , I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand : the fresco of Ambrogio Lorenzetti , which speak of bon governo [ good government ] and Mal governo [ bad government ] . </s>
What we need here be good government , Madam President . </s>
since we be recover from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institution and give them substance . </s>
I would like to remind the house of something which we often forget , and that be that the investiture of the Prodi Commission , last September , receive wide support . </s>
in our opinion , this demonstrate that the majority of us be in favour of progress and in favour of Europe . </s>
I would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there be some group which say that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council . </s>
it be precisely this which , in a sense , be hinder the important process of develop codecision within the legislative programme . </s>
I be point this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also have to lead to continuity in the work carry out throughout the legislature . </s>
on the other hand , we be witness the birth of a political Europe , which entail a collection of shared value which we all agree upon , and a European union at the service of the citizen . </s>
with regard to the event of recent day , I would like to say - and I be say this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference be start - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental right which , give what we have say about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully include in the treaty . </s>
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it be an essential point . </s>
in this regard , Madam President , I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language . </s>
last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition describe the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre . </s>
those of us who have have to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorship with cardboard government . </s>
There can be no democracy without a live parliament . </s>
I believe that this type of language be extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now . </s>
with regard to the four great priority which President Prodi systematically refer to and with regard to his analysis of the challenge face us , I would say that we be very much in agreement . </s>
nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , as far as the Socialist Group be concern , there have be a change of priority . </s>
we understand that the first priority be the economic and social agenda , which also include what be know as ' quality of life ' priority , that be to say , the right of citizen as consumer and as people , in relation to those question which we always talk about , but never give sufficient priority to , that be , the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstance , consumer right , respect for the environment and sustainable development . </s>
when speak of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these day , full employment do not mean what it mean in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War , that be to say , employment for the male head of the household . </s>
we must argue for equality of the sex , the famous ' gender mainstreaming ' , which be one of the least developed question in the Prodi Commission 's programme . </s>
this mean prioritising sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion be under threat . </s>
this must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission . </s>
it must be complement with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a Union which have become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , give its prosperity and seasonal demographic . </s>
I believe that this be the first objective for us to pursue . </s>
in this respect I would also add another element , which be economic government , give the single currency , and I believe this be inescapable . </s>
this be another question on which the Commission must make progress . </s>
with regard to the ambitious objective and , above all , the Commission 's important step of adopt this broaden of the process of negotiation and integration , I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda @card@ . </s>
do the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ? </s>
the issue of taxation also seem to us to be absolutely essential . </s>
with regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical term . </s>
I would like to remind you of one thing : it be dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European union from here . </s>
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity . </s>
if we be capable of define what our area of governance be , I think that would be very positive . </s>
in all other area , I believe that subsidiarity be also relevant to this discussion . </s>
not only should the Commission discuss this , but also our state , our parliament and our civil society . </s>
madam President , I would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seem to us to be absolutely fundamental : the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe 's role in the world . </s>
it appear that there be agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe , with regard to enlargement and - as I have say already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflict , as well as an issue which we seldom talk about ; the North-South challenge . </s>
we must not forget Africa , a continent which have be forsake , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to cooperate with development . </s>
lastly , an issue for which we be increasingly responsible , as the world be foremost economic and commercial power , that be , Europe 's voice in the world , which do not simply mean adopt an active approach to the Millennium Round . </s>
it mean the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institution , for which Europe have an enormous responsibility . </s>
above all , Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language , clearly , by change to some extent the jargon which we use , because we can ask the Europeans , who be live through profound change , to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible . </s>
this be a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us . </s>
I hope this will be demonstrate when we hold the next European election . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that be that the stake now be irrefutably political . </s>
they be political because we be move on . </s>
even though we have not yet finish construct all the economic building block , we be move on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective . </s>
the challenge of enlargement be political . </s>
the challenge of create an area of justice and home affair , of deal with asylum and immigration and crime , be very political . </s>
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy be very political . </s>
because it be political it be more complex . </s>
because it be political it be more sovereignty-sensitive . </s>
because it be more sovereignty-sensitive it be more voter-and citizen-sensitive . </s>
we need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political end and objective , to address , not merely the scepticism but the great enemy , the apathy which you identify . </s>
the mean of achieve this be difficult but they be real . </s>
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institution , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge . </s>
we need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society . </s>
we need more explanation of what Europe be about . </s>
we need to be able to confront fear and anxiety , because in many instance the great fear be fear itself . </s>
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that . </s>
my group be especially attract to the creative possibility you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring address the issue of governance . </s>
as we look at the Europe of network which you describe , it be very important that Europe concentrate on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest area where Europe may perhaps stand back . </s>
that could convince people that Europe , in its governance , be not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrate and soak up more power , more decision , more authority . </s>
that be the political core of the challenge and I think you have identify it well before this House today . </s>
for my group , enlargement be the first priority against which all the other possibility for reform must be measure , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institution . </s>
we see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of &quot; them and us &quot; . </s>
we see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate state . </s>
I suggest to the Commission , as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explain the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial term but in a broad sense ; a document , like the Cecchini report before the Single Act , that explain to people in a way which engage them in the debate that this be the grand , historic challenge face Europe today . </s>
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully . </s>
on south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institution through their achievement . </s>
in the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of win the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe . </s>
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreement , but we would like to see more . </s>
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week . </s>
the strategic paper emphasise the global role of the European Union . </s>
our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affair commensurate with its weight in term of aid , trade and finance . </s>
at the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institution will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary body , where we fit into UN agency and so on . </s>
we need to open that debate . </s>
in conclusion , this morning , the day after St Valentine 's Day , the newspaper be say that your honeymoon period be over . </s>
I do not know whether you be a romantic or not , Mr Prodi . </s>
perhaps this be a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning . </s>
however , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it mean we be now settle down to business . </s>
that be the way it should be . </s>
regard the many adjectival description of Europe you address in your speech - an energetic Europe , an enterprising Europe , a Europe that have a human face and be inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my liberal colleague , give in one adjective , one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enable Europe . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally . </s>
you give consideration to important question of principle in your programme . </s>
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issue alongside the day-to-day one . </s>
at the same time , however , it have to be say that , unfortunately , your programme remind me in many way of a party manifesto . </s>
There be a lot of good intention in it , but it very much lack concrete proposal concern how this can all be achieve . </s>
as in any other party manifesto , it be full of contradiction . </s>
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them . </s>
First let me speak about the economy and social development . </s>
we have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that be what be mention in your programme . </s>
Should we at long last be draft convergence criterion , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be high than , say , the three most successful country in this matter ? </s>
ecological tax reform be what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by change our taxation structure . </s>
but , unfortunately , as we all know , this be an area where the European Union be totally unable to act . </s>
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference . </s>
the Eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focus on task that individual country can attend to alone . </s>
in this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision-making . </s>
One contradiction within your programme relate to globalisation . </s>
I think it be very creditable that you should mention the concept of ' global administration ' , as other too have say here . </s>
however , please learn from the event of Seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those value of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other . </s>
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community . </s>
do please try to make the international organisation democratic . </s>
the European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring . </s>
we can submit motion for this together with you . </s>
finally , I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this be another contradiction . </s>
you ought to also be able to draw conclusion at the IGC . </s>
we have to table motion propose that our citizen might really have a direct impact on decision-making . </s>
What you just say be absolutely true : people want more engage democracy . </s>
in my opinion , this be the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too . </s>
madam President , my group be one of those which want to have a document allow an exchange of view on the Commission 's strategic objective within the group before this debate , instead of be reduce to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary . </s>
the main merit of the text of this communication be therefore the fact that it exist . </s>
we be also please to see certain statement and intention which it contain and which Mr Prodi have just underline and , in some case , usefully clarify . </s>
the current globalisation process be - and I quote - ' exclusive rather than inclusive and have widen the inequality ' . </s>
the European Union 's objective must therefore be to help define new ground rule within the Union and in international relation . </s>
clearly , many citizen be ' disenchanted and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solution to basic problem , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence . </s>
this must be one of our absolute priority . </s>
we do need to rethink many aspect of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement be to be a success . </s>
we also need ' distinctive strategic partnership ' with our neighbour to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace . </s>
There be plenty of area for serious discussion . </s>
we will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begin or promise . </s>
it be in this spirit that I have three criticism to make . </s>
these must be take into account if we be truly to shape the new Europe , as proclaim ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi 's speech and do so in reality not rhetoric . </s>
the first and most serious criticism concern the Commission 's propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partner . </s>
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lie in the opening sentence of the Commission communication . </s>
this talk of the European union as ' live proof that peace , stability , freedom and prosperity can be bring to a continent ' and as a model show the world the way forward . </s>
it conclude that ' our neighbour have the chance to join this prosperity , and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' . </s>
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view . </s>
similarly , the idea that the euro have foster a consensus on wage moderation be not really bear out by the repeated nervous order issue by the European Central Bank to the trade union which be deem to be too demand . </s>
my second criticism follow on from the first . </s>
this extreme difficulty in see the contradiction of the current situation and , where necessary , confront these be seriously limit the will , duly confirm by Mr Prodi , to grant public demand . </s>
for example , at least in the country which I know well , I doubt that the intention , repeat three or four time in the Commission document , to reform ' Europe 's social protection , health care and pension system ... in a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the need of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back . </s>
my third criticism stem from the first two . </s>
the weakness of the analysis and the obstacle to the necessary change have result in a project whose scope be severely limit by an overabundance of generalisation , a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus . </s>
but all be not lose . </s>
this be a start point and we have five year to succeed , provide that the political will exist and be express with sufficient force and clarity . </s>
my group be fully intent on help with this work . </s>
madam President , reform and democratise the institution of the European Union be central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process . </s>
this be the open statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he present the strategic objective of the European Commission for the next five year . </s>
we await the White Paper on the governance of the European union deal with the issue of balance between Member States ' government and the European Union institution which be to be publish this summer . </s>
on this specific point I think it be important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedure of the Commission . </s>
the Commission , in its proposal to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , have indicate that its preference lie in see small Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission . </s>
this be a scenario whereby the European Union have a membership of over @card@ Member States . </s>
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union build . </s>
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaty . </s>
There must be equality in term of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institution . </s>
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America give small state the same recognition as large state in the United States Senate . </s>
more or less each of the @card@ state in the US have two elect position in the United States Senate , regardless of its population . </s>
any future reform of the European Union treaty will require a referendum to be hold in my country . </s>
it would be very difficult for those who propose a ' yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission . </s>
undoubtedly , reform of the European Council be also go to be include in this White Paper on the governance of the European union which will be publish this summer . </s>
once again there be special area of policy-making which should be leave to the domain of the national Member States . </s>
I do not believe that there be broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affair , and foreign affair at European Union level . </s>
at present , under Article @card@ of the Treaty of Rome , decision take at Eu level concern tax change must be by unanimity . </s>
I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the working of the European Union . </s>
I support the enlargement of the European Union . </s>
I support institutional change so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union take place in a streamlined and structured manner . </s>
however , we must remember that the public opinion of @card@ million people in the European Union be a vital factor in change the Eu treaty . </s>
change should not be bring about too quickly and can be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed . </s>
madam President , I be speak on behalf of the Italian radical member . </s>
president of the Commission , a short while ago you say that no political structure set out five-year plan . </s>
this be true , if we think of Russia 's plan in the thirty , but at the start of your mandate , a few month ago , you yourself announce at the conference of president that you would , however , be present a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy line of the European government of which you be head and in the running of which we be engage today . </s>
so , whether this be to be a government programme or a potential programme , the breakdown of the document you distribute to us and of the accompanying speech be not much more than a list of good intention , or rather a list of issue on the table . </s>
it do not , however , give us the impression that the Commission be take a clear position on any of these point , but that it be just do the European Commission 's duty . </s>
in this House , in the past , large-scale debate have take place on major strategic option which the Commission , under its power of initiative , launch , not as experiment , but as proposal which then make vary degree of progress , but in any case do contribute to the integration and development of the European Union . </s>
in this case , Mr Prodi , we certainly have a kind of &quot; Ten commandment &quot; : a whole raft of issue be list , but if I may say so , we be leave with the impression that the Commission be afraid to make any decision regard what need to be do about any of these point . </s>
There be only one point that you really stress - too much in my opinion - and that be that it look almost as if the high priority task that you be set yourself be to cease &quot; unnecessary &quot; activity . </s>
we should be careful , though , Mr Prodi , because we have a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and back this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority back this Commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of be guide by a firm hand . </s>
let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission , not believe itself to be equal to the task , wish , or propose to shed , for example , its power to implement common policy , which it be nevertheless accord by the Treaty . </s>
What do we expect from a government in any case ? </s>
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which be , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ? </s>
it be right for joint resource to be control supranationally and not to be delegate to the Member States or the Taos , as have be the case in the past . </s>
it seem that you be propose the same old menu , but with more unsatisfactory implication , restrict the Commission , so you say , to the task of draw up a few White Papers , as you propose . </s>
my fear - even if you shake your head , Mr Prodi - be that this will translate into what some country have think for year , that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers . </s>
if this be the role that the Commission intend to play over the next five year , we federalist be convince , we be certain that this be not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intend to do in this regard . </s>
the reform be important but , if it aggravate the situation , reduce or weaken the supranational power of the Commission , then the structure of European integration , as plan by the founding father for the European Commission , will be at risk . </s>
as for the other point , Mr Prodi , I will take economic and social policy as an example : the European social model be certainly experience a major crisis and it be certainly not coincidental that unemployment top the list of problem that none of our policy have manage to resolve , but it be not certain that it can be resolve by go through a list of problem that we have discuss in the past , without have a clear idea or proposal which take note of the fact that Europe contain economy that be grow at some of the most sustainable rate and that it be not by chance that these be the economy which have make labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective . </s>
if we continue to get bogged down with proposal that have give extremely poor result so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do . </s>
the same go for enlargement as an end in itself , without it be link to a reform to make the European Union and its structure much more efficient , and to proposal that the Commission could have make at the IGC . </s>
Mr Prodi , there be one positive thing that I would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some member , regard the telegram that you send to the Austrian government . </s>
we approve of your position on this : you do well not to isolate that country any further . </s>
in any case , we shall see what specific step transpire when the time come for practical action . </s>
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this be , in our opinion , a slightly short-sighted view . </s>
above all , it lack drive in the sector I have mention , for example , as regard the Balkans . </s>
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process , disregard the fact that Croatia , Macedonia and other country also have the right to a place in this house that be open to all ? </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union 's activity and ask why , then , you be propose a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation . </s>
I remember your predecessor 's speech five year ago . </s>
like yourself , he promise &quot; less and good &quot; , but Mr Santer finish up by have deliver &quot; much more and much bad &quot; , and I do not believe that you , either , can deliver the good you promise . </s>
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation . </s>
the legislative programme be , in fact , a litany of subject over which the people be to be deprive of influence and in connection with which , Mr Prodi , you be to take influence away from the people , even on social question . </s>
you talk about great transparency , but produce proposal which would lead to document which , at present , be available for public inspection be lock away . </s>
your Commission consist of the only @card@ people in the Eu who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduce . </s>
local politician can do that , once legislation have be pass in Brussels . </s>
the legislative programme from the Commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompany by as long a list of task which be to be refer back to the Member States and to the process of popular democracy . </s>
otherwise , the number of law produce in Brussels will just keep on grow . </s>
we have pass @card@ @card@ law and as many amendment , and the applicant state have have @card@ @card@ document send to them which , as debate by the Polish parliament , fill @card@ @card@ side of paper . </s>
even by this stage , that be already too many by far . </s>
Brussels should make decision on few matter and hand over more decision to the people , the region and the Member States . </s>
the only decision which should remain with Brussels be those concern cross-border issue which the national parliament can no longer legislate on effectively . </s>
What be more , the work carry out in Brussels should be of a much high quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of own the process , now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have take their autonomy away from them . </s>
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba 's attention to what the founding father of the European Union dream of . </s>
take a look at Jean Monet 's memoir . </s>
What he envisage be what he call a small , practical secretariat . </s>
that be not what Mr Prodi be President of today . </s>
madam President , this morning the Commission President , Mr Prodi , have set out ambitious goal for the European union for the next five year , laudable aim indeed , to make a strong and effective European presence feel in the world : succeed with enlargement , meet the challenge of sell e-Europe , introduce good principle of governance . </s>
we accept that Europeans , particularly the young generation , need to be give a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the year ahead . </s>
but how be we to succeed when the resource available be limit and the credibility of our institution be not very high ? </s>
we need to match this vision with reality . </s>
here there be three element I would like to contribute . </s>
firstly , we need a successful European economy . </s>
we must ensure that unemployment rate continue to go down across Europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet , show that e-Europe be a good initiative . </s>
but we must avoid lurch back into the old-style regulation , stifle individual initiative and enterprise . </s>
we must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society . </s>
without a successful European economy we can meet the challenge ahead , particularly of enlargement . </s>
secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity . </s>
do less but good - a central plank of the last Commission - need to be the aim of this Commission too . </s>
we will be look at this closely when we come to the annual programme of propose legislation . </s>
Mr Bonde be right to say that there be this image of do less good and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year @card@ of @card@ proposal and recommendation , which seem to go in a different direction . </s>
we must establish priority and make sure there be value for money in each of these programme . </s>
lastly , we need to ensure that there be proper , genuine reform of the European Commission . </s>
yes , the Commission - guardian of the treaty - be mean to be an independent body , but it also have to be accountable to European citizen through our Parliament . </s>
the information problem , which Mr Bonde just refer to , be treat like a straw in the wind , with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us , as citizen and as parliamentarian , although we have the right to it under the treaty . </s>
the Commission be not in fact today a European government . </s>
the Commission do not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament . </s>
we in Parliament have a major role to play in the shape of governance in Europe . </s>
this governance therefore need to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institution in the European Union , have its relevant role to play . </s>
therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in work together we can restore the image of the European union to our citizen . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , numerous step have be take in the past to strengthen the European Union , from the euro to resolution on a common security policy ; even to the response by the @card@ , the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria . </s>
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principle behind these decision . </s>
Nonetheless , I agree with you , Mr President of the Commission , that many more step to strengthen the European Union will be need in the future because the European Union be not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movement which , to put it mildly , have an ambivalent attitude towards European value of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent . </s>
that do not apply to Austria alone . </s>
the Union profess its faith in its fundamental value in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institution of the Eu confirm this faith once again when the new coalition be form in Austria . </s>
however , the full potential of these value will only be realise if they be set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claim on the part of individual citizen . </s>
when it come down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty be not enough . </s>
in this sense , the Commission must insist , and I should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding , enforceable right . </s>
in this sense , the Commission must insist on build up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speaker . </s>
only reasonable , feasible and humane principle of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , mislead and demagogic allegation of the extreme right . </s>
but , and I would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompany by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , marginalisation and grow inequality be the good breeding ground for anti-European , nationalistic action and reaction . </s>
in this respect , Mr President of the Commission , I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculate on and how it be perceive by large segment of the population . </s>
the feeling of be at the mercy of other , of lack in influence and of have no protection from the state lead in the good case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , as in the European election and , in the bad case scenario , to extremist voting pattern . </s>
the Union , like everyone else , have not yet understand how to present the Eu to the citizen of the Eu as a means of protection against the negative effect of globalisation . </s>
we be in the process of build a house but too few of our citizen really feel at home in our house . </s>
What we need be not just reform of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and , significantly , the President of the Commission forget to mention the reform of the financial institution and international financial architecture ; we also need confidence-building measure for our citizen , who rightly expect help and support from and in the Eu with the inevitable and painful process of adapt to new global circumstance . </s>
in this respect , what the Commission say about boost Europe 's voice be important . </s>
you yourself , Mr President , speak of a model of which , unfortunately , there be little mention in the document . </s>
you say that we must offer our citizen a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which differ from other model , include the US model . </s>
in this sense , the USA be not only our partner ; it be also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offer our citizen the good model . </s>
I hope that what we have say so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforce in the Commission document . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , the great legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumble and confuse power and competence of the Commission , and perhaps of the Union itself . </s>
you have make a bold start by rightly emphasise the need to focus on so-called &quot; core task &quot; . </s>
that , as you have say yourself today , mean that you must also identify task , policy and programme which be peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation . </s>
Many existing European Union policy and programme may simply have pass their sell-by date , or have be prove unwieldy or ineffective when administer at European level . </s>
the challenge now be to have the courage to devolve as many non-core task as possible back to low level of national , regional and local government . </s>
if we be to succeed in persuade a sceptical European public of the merit of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we be as active in the devolution of unwarranted Eu power as we be in the evolution of new Eu power . </s>
we must not allow the critic of European integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just hear from Mr Bonde , that the increase in Eu responsibility be a one-way street only . </s>
it must be show to be a two-way process in which existing Eu policy and programme , which be not clearly justify on the ground of subsidiarity and proportionality , be devolve and repeal . </s>
if you be able to match these aspiration with action in the year ahead , you will be make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European union as a whole and , as we have hear today , you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , I fully support the thinking of the proposal make by my colleague , Mrs Hautala , on the Commission 's strategic objective for the come five year . </s>
I myself want to refer to a subject which have not be mention but which be on the agenda , namely the Commission 's work programme for @card@ . </s>
I be aware of the limitation of the exercise give that we have to work within the current Treaty and be therefore restrict by its operational rule . </s>
I be think in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I be not , however , go to talk about . </s>
rather , I want to start by welcome certain proposal which you have make in this programme for @card@ . </s>
these include all the proposal on food safety which be ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which be particularly important give the two oil slick which have affect the coast of Brittany and Turkey . </s>
the Commission should react quickly in this respect . </s>
however , on other issue the proposal could be more ambitious and faster acting . </s>
I have some positive suggestion to make , particularly on the social area , the environment and the follow-up to Seattle . </s>
firstly , you have say that the citizen of Europe must be reconcile with the institution . </s>
this be self-evident and it be therefore essential to find out their main concern . </s>
for example , in the social area , it be not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action . </s>
we must move faster . </s>
you must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year . </s>
the issue of company closure and mass redundancy be one which have be and still be very firmly in the news . </s>
we be work on the basis of a directive whose limitation have be clearly demonstrate . </s>
I therefore propose that this should be review in order to produce a directive which be more effective in protect employment and also in impose penalty on those who do not comply . </s>
on the environment , you have announce a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment . </s>
this be all very well but it seem that the text to be propose will not contain any specific objective or a timetable for implementation . </s>
perhaps you can correct me on this . </s>
I personally feel that it be essential to have precise objective and a proper timetable for implementation . </s>
in term of civil liability for the environment , it be right that we finally have a White Paper . </s>
however , Parliament do ask for a legislative initiative six year ago . </s>
the White Paper clearly foreshadow this legislation but for when ? </s>
you must realise that this process need to be accelerate . </s>
finally , after Kyoto , we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposal . </s>
finally , on the subject of the WTO , the idea of relaunch a new global round be not necessarily bad . </s>
however , in the first place , the Commission should make proposal on change the operational rule of the WTO . </s>
the Commission have a role both within the Eu and throughout the world . </s>
the European Union must therefore instigate a re-evaluation of the WTO 's operation which must lead to precise proposal be make on its rule . </s>
madam President , you speak about fundamental political value , and one of the fundamental political value , even more important than democracy , be respect for other . </s>
we therefore feel that you act correctly in send a message and that perhaps those who protest about it be still feel the effect of Bolshevism or Nazism . </s>
democracy mean dialogue with other and make other realise when they be wrong , but also listen to their explanation . </s>
enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale have be repeat this for ten year in this House - must not mean dilution , that be , it must not entail more risk . </s>
the applicant country ' hope be at least as important as the hope of our current fellow citizen , who be begin to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe work , as it be not resolve the most serious problem . </s>
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreement which - should it be necessary - need to be redraft with regard to certain fundamental issue such as the environmental disaster that have occur in Romania , reach as far as Belgrade , but above all , the continue spread of apathy as regard major security issue . </s>
even today , we do not have definite answer regard the monitoring of the nuclear power station in the eastern republic . </s>
we therefore need resource available to spend before proceed to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitor quality of life and living condition , with the aim of create a new world where such tragedy will no longer occur . </s>
I would also like to say a few word on Africa , Madam President . </s>
the third and fourth world have be abandon : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many child . </s>
Europe , which be so democratic , so progressive , do not speak out or take these tragic problem on board , while half of Africa be die of Aids and other disease . </s>
One final remark regard the Internet and globalisation . </s>
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduce to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean level of value or dampen of hope and enthusiasm . </s>
the people which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hand of a few . </s>
as for the Internet , Europe have finally find the courage to say that we need rule . </s>
on a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirate who , by act the way they be , be force the world to reflect on the only system which be currently unregulated . </s>
we live in a world of rule and regulation : let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizen rule and hope for the future . </s>
madam President , as a Padanian taxpayer , I have already experience the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since Padania be liable to Italy for its taxis as well . </s>
listen to him just now , I be concern when he mention new resource , something that readily translate as additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that be the entry of new state into the Union . </s>
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ? </s>
my Padanian electorate who , thank to Mr Prodi , have already pay what in Italy be know as the European tax - repay only in part - have absolutely no intention , thank once again to Mr Prodi , of pay another tax for someone else . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , member of the Commission , five month after its come into office , the Commission commit to paper the direction in which it aim to steer the European Union . </s>
the ensue document be both ambitious and bombastic . </s>
be it not rather melodramatic to say that &quot; the world look up to Europe &quot; ? </s>
moreover , Europe as a continent be a great deal more than just the fifteen Eu Member States . </s>
it be not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human right in the whole of Europe , no less ? </s>
I be particularly intrigue by how the Commission consider bring this about . </s>
do &quot; the European integration model as a rich source for global administration &quot; imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power ? </s>
accord to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provide everyone know exactly who be in charge ! </s>
so who be this then ? </s>
the Commission as a whole , its president perhaps , the Council ? </s>
you state that the new European government require strong institution , while the Commission want to focus at the same time on its core task . </s>
we could not agree more with the latter . </s>
it be high time that institution restrict their scope to actual cross-border issue and stop deck out the European cart with power which they be take away from national authority . </s>
the document mention common value on different occasion . </s>
unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standard to be lack . </s>
this raise the question as to what these standard and value be base on . </s>
I be convince that the Bible , God 's word , be the only pure source of proper standard and real value . </s>
in the tradition of our continent , this realisation be an important one which merit recognition . </s>
madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi and the Commission on their government policy statement . </s>
I very much agree with the gist of the document . </s>
I also share the view of Mr Prodi and the Commission that in a number of area , there be a need for more Europe and more integration , and rightly so . </s>
area such as security , the World Trade Conference , food safety , but also the new economy , require more action , therefore , from the European Commission . </s>
it will be a challenge to find a way of bring the Member States , the Council , the European Parliament , the national parliament , the Commission and all kind of other agent into line . </s>
the European Commission will need to play an important director 's role in this , provide that clear and attainable objective be in place . </s>
clear priority , focus , and , above all , communication with society to inform them of what we be up to , be the key goal . </s>
that require from the Commission , with a view to subsidiarity , concrete plan which we would like to see implement in the forthcoming programme . </s>
There be , in itself , nothing wrong with emphasise the core function , and I applaud the fact that the Commission would like to assume a good , more prominent role in order to develop policy idea and political initiative . </s>
but what also matter be the actual implementation of the Commission 's idea . </s>
take the Telecom sector , for example . </s>
although we have draft a large number of directive , at the end of the day , we still have @card@ different market and the @card@ Member States still implement the directive differently . </s>
and where implementation be concern , the Commission need to ensure that our political wish be also implement in practice . </s>
look at foreign policy , Madam President , I very much like the ambition that the European Union should have as much political as economic say at world level . </s>
but then I wonder : if there be talk of a real common policy , of a system of crisis prevention and crisis control at Community level , where be the actual proposal then ? </s>
indeed , at the end of the day , we need these in order to verify whether we can realise our objective in this area . </s>
Mr Prodi be right in devote a lot of attention to Africa in his speech , but I have to say that I be nonetheless disappoint when I study the work programme for @card@ . </s>
I can find any reference to Africa in the introduction , nor in the programme itself , and I do hope , therefore , that Mr Prodi will produce a proper file by way of preparation of the Summit in Africa . </s>
madam President , word be essential , but we can only judge the Commission on its merit . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , lady and gentleman , I be not sure which to go by : the strategic objective for @card@ to @card@ or your speech for @card@ to @card@ ? </s>
have you already include your second term of office ? </s>
but seriously . </s>
as it enlarge , the Union need to be strengthen through streamlining and demarcation . </s>
first , streamlining . </s>
What you say in your programme about concentrate on the core function of the Commission be only the beginning . </s>
the activity of the entire union must be reduce to core area of policy . </s>
in other word , a social , ecologically-orientated market , a secure currency , guarantee civil right internally and representation of common interest externally . </s>
it be not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it be what we want to say with this voice that it be important . </s>
secondly , the new &quot; in &quot; word be flexibility . </s>
however , increase flexibility can or quickly threaten to turn into intergovernmentalisation . </s>
we must hold fast to joint decision-making institution which embrace the Member States . </s>
that also apply to the inclusion of the civil society , which be a welcome step . </s>
our citizen do not need any new institution and certainly no new mix of power . </s>
( applause ) Transparency do not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizen , transparency mean great clarity at long last as to who take decision in Brussels and Strasbourg , when and with what right . </s>
that be transparency . </s>
thirdly , the European Union can and should not enlarge endlessly . </s>
its border be set not by how may country want to join , but by how many country it can accommodate . </s>
( applause ) if the price of enlargement be the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union , then it must not be pay . </s>
it be too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the state which want to join the Union . </s>
There be no future for a Union which be merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which be merely a free trade zone . </s>
but the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredit by the people of Europe if it see itself as a community of destiny . </s>
that go far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , good quality of life . </s>
not only the Commission , not only the European Parliament but also the people and the state in our European Union will have to find new answer to the question of how and why we want to live and work together . </s>
in do so , we need , no less , to reinvent the European Union , but without destroy the present Union . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole union in the come year be the successful realisation of enlargement . </s>
the Commission must carry on negotiation that be a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible . </s>
on the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievement or aim of integration that have be state thus far be water down . </s>
To avoid this the European liberal democrat have express the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various model of differentiate integration and create a concentric Union , in which there be a federal core and a less integrated outer ring . </s>
it be clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raise at the IGC . </s>
the subject need to be discuss without prejudice . </s>
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of develop our institution for the country in the vanguard as propose by Jacques Delors , for example . </s>
in this way , a decision-making system can be create that be more effective , clear , more open and more democratic . </s>
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concern how the expand Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspiring speech , Mr Prodi , have quite win me over . </s>
it raise expectation , but it can also lead to disappointment . </s>
this be connect to what Mr Van Velzen be just say , about the difference between word and deed . </s>
the enlargement of the Union be inspire by our wish for peace , security and stability . </s>
you be look to reassure the accede country , as well as European opinion . </s>
but these day , we be witness the exact reverse before our very eye . </s>
we have note increase level of apprehension and disquiet , even within region where unemployment be quite low and prosperity very high . </s>
we need to make our citizen feel at home , accord to Mr Swoboda , and I agree . </s>
this be a place where we share the same value and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility . </s>
this be probably link to the standard mention by Mr Van Dam , namely subsidiarity . </s>
it be necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all level of authority and to be partner , rather than competitor when it come to policy . </s>
it be also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizen , where it can be exercise with due transparency and can be monitor by the citizen themselves . </s>
that will require a new political culture , not only in word , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and region . </s>
region which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States . </s>
the new Europe should not only expand horizontally , but also vertically , by live by our value in practice and by develop a democratic structure of a real community . </s>
this be what the Commission will be judge on . </s>
madam President , the Commission be today present its strategic objective for @card@ . </s>
these be contain in an extremely general document in which all the problem have be gloss over to prevent any conflict . </s>
so , in the first part on the new form of European governance , the word ' federalism ' and ' superstate ' be not mention at all . </s>
yet these be the main theme in any discussion of strong European institution in which only day-to-day task of execution be decentralise and a collective vision be promote within an indistinct whole . </s>
in this scenario the government and national parliament be merge with the regional and even local authority and with the civil society , all of which be describe , with no form of hierarchy , as ' integral element of European governance ' . </s>
these ambiguity mask many misunderstanding , primarily about our value . </s>
it be not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat . </s>
it must clearly be accept that the people should be free to make their decision at the level which good combine the objective condition of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main . </s>
yet the whole of the Commission communication be base on the opposite theory . </s>
in this theory , on the pretext of ensure the good protection for people , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limit by new regulation , new policy or new , restrictive legal structure such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
this Charter be really misname because it will actually reduce these right . </s>
in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principle be rather different . </s>
clearly we want to defend the country of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nation . </s>
this be not impossible . </s>
we must move away from the outmoded federalist scheme promote by those whose every idea on European matter come from the Memoires of Jean Monnet . </s>
instead , we must open the European institution to the modern world by create a flexible dynamic which respect nation . </s>
this be the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have like to have see in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which be unfortunately not there . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , you claim to be shape a new Europe yet you be lack one basic element : confidence . </s>
the confidence of million of Europeans can be win without be worthy of this . </s>
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption ? </s>
you be responsible for million of unemployed and for million live in poverty , insecurity and increase misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policy and because of the force march towards the single currency . </s>
you want and have obtain the abolition of internal border . </s>
consequently , you have open Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration . </s>
you be now propose to give all decision-making power to a handful of official . </s>
the Member States , local authority and NGOs will simply become enforcer of decision hand down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels . </s>
not once do your twelve-page document mention the national parliament even though they comprise the elect representative of the people . </s>
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy . </s>
you dare not even call a spade a spade , but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by use the term ' governance ' for what be nothing more than federal , autocratic , centralise government . </s>
have try for many year to persuade us by talk of share sovereignty , you be now reveal your ultimate goal . </s>
you intend to trade in all European sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position . </s>
finally , you be daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of million of Austrian , or be allow this to happen , just because the result do not suit you . </s>
yet at the same time you be support Communist China and trading with country which have openly violate human right for decade . </s>
member of this House be today speak out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which , quite obviously , be not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre . </s>
your sabre-rattling fool no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need Austria in order to reform the treaty and harmonise saving tax . </s>
you will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real power in the construction of the European Union . </s>
your commissioner be clearly not solely responsible for this . </s>
the government which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you be also responsible . </s>
Brussels be not all of us , as you claim . </s>
it be all of you . </s>
tell the truth for once . </s>
you could not care less what the people of Europe want . </s>
they be free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement . </s>
it be over ten year since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your project contain a strong hint of the gulag and mollify moralism . </s>
we be among the small number who denounce the communist dictatorship . </s>
we be and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship . </s>
we call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous project . </s>
the salvation of European democracy be with nation state . </s>
Europe 's salvation lie in the cooperation of the nation of Europe . </s>
( limited applause ) President Prodi , today you have present the Commission 's five-year programme , and it have many objective that we endorse . </s>
it be a programme base on real-life situation and issue , and it be therefore right to put concrete measure aside for the moment and focus on the major issue . </s>
in my view , Mr Prodi , judge from the text and the document that you have send to us , one subject that be very important to both of us have be give secondary importance , and that be solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level . </s>
the archbishop of Milan , Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini , be call upon all politician , in particular those like you and me , President Prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics be the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics , to reconsider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , take the marginalised and those leave behind by society very much into account . </s>
it be of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who can keep up , one which remind us of how difficult and complicated it be to establish progress indicator and how inadequate it be to use the parameter of per capita income alone . </s>
it also remind us of the need for a new growth model , one that be firmly root in the culture of the Catholics who be involve in social problem , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encourage and facilitate among the public , the most natural instrument for building solidarity . </s>
the fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which come before economic gain - be thus enhance . </s>
this social freedom , which become manifest in initiative favour the poor , give excellent result in term of social justice and stability . </s>
Mr President , public institution must not accept only the economic criterion . </s>
they must focus on service to people and commitment to achieve freedom for each individual , without forget , naturally , that all this can and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an order and focus system , entrepreneur be able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity . </s>
in the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rule that will provide guarantee to the economic operator and consumer , the European Commission can forget solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man 's spiritual resource in his relation with his fellow man . </s>
our heritage have teach us that politics must have a heart . </s>
we hope that the White Paper and the action of you and your Commission will put this into practice . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ' shape the new Europe ' be an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all . </s>
our ambition and our work will be follow not only by people in our own country , but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union . </s>
What sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ? </s>
my reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirm that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at be an economic community but will become a community that can be trust and that we take seriously . </s>
the Commission be correct in state that the Union intend to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation . </s>
it foresee a just and more effective Europe that also recognise its responsibility beyond its own border out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest . </s>
consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the great enemy of peace and freedom . </s>
I concur with what other member of my political group have say and I commend the tone of your document . </s>
however , there be two omission which need to be address in our future work . </s>
the first concern woman , gender and woman 's right . </s>
you talk about how woman can help in increase production and growth . </s>
that be important , but equality be not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our society more democratic . </s>
it be therefore noticeable that ' equality ' , ' gender ' and ' woman ' be barely mention in ' shape the New Europe ' . </s>
you mention ' woman ' in your speech , but they be not refer to in the context of the strategic goal . </s>
be that because mainstreaming be already so widespread in the Commission that there be no need to mention woman ? </s>
What other explanation could there be for omit woman ? </s>
the Eu must not take on a masculine persona . </s>
my other question concern Africa , which be the only continent not mention in ' shape the New Europe ' . </s>
Africa have the large number of refugee in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic . </s>
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other commissioner be do a fine job , but the rest of the Commission also need to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by include it among its strategic goal . </s>
finally , I welcome the Commission 's statement and the fact that this say for the first time that the Eu be prepare unilaterally to introduce measure to make it easy for develop country to gain access to our market . </s>
I would merely ask when this be likely to take effect . </s>
madam President , President of the Commission , this be a vital document for the future and fate of Europe . </s>
however , out of all the point , two specifically require our attention , and they be closely link : peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe . </s>
it be a question of objective that must be pursue as a priority . </s>
for some time , we have all agree on this notion , but we must also clearly affirm that these objective will not be achieve without enlargement , even if this come at a price . </s>
today , we have be call on to choose , for the forthcoming decade , between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy , but where there be uncertainty over what the future might bring . </s>
these goal will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , result in constitutional reform , provide the Commission with real and adequate power so that it will no longer merely implement Council decision or Parliament 's codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government . </s>
the first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself , if it really want to increase its role of interpret the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which be part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrate Union . </s>
moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the task it take on accord to the actual power it will be accord . </s>
without these prospect that we have outline , Europe would , once again , have no future . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , we be please about the overall intention of the objective announce which be in line with the challenge which Europe must overcome . </s>
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century . </s>
this event must underpin enlargement . </s>
rather than use the word ' enlargement ' , I want to talk of reunification which have much great political significance . </s>
your idea be to concentrate your activity on the core task . </s>
this be one of the goal of your reform . </s>
in essence this means apply the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the action take and give our citizen a clear view of each level of competence . </s>
however , say be one thing and do be another ! </s>
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institution to try and increase their power . </s>
I will therefore judge you on your deed . </s>
in the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly express desire in your communication . </s>
however , I must make two essential point . </s>
these concern the simplification and application of Community law . </s>
in @card@ , @card@ referral be make to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and @card@ % of environmental directive be not apply or transpose . </s>
Recent event have show us that these regulation be essential . </s>
community law must not go unapplied because it be too complex or too pedantic . </s>
the Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication do not go into more detail on this . </s>
you be be realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate response to the problem face us , include unemployment . </s>
nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative have not be propose . </s>
the emphasis should have be place on the rejection of any policy of handout and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility . </s>
you have not highlight the age of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in term of public health . </s>
this be a silent revolution and in this respect I expect more from your communication . </s>
finally , you do highlight European research as be at the heart of our future . </s>
yet you do not indicate the resource you intend to implement to achieve this . </s>
also , ethical principle be at the heart of this research but your communication say nothing about these . </s>
if you want to well inform the people , you should start by strengthen liaison with this House , as we be the representative of the citizen . </s>
madam President , we can only endorse the general guideline of the five-year programme and of the programme for @card@ , set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning . </s>
in the two document , strong emphasis be place on the need to define new form of European governance and , to this end , to introduce a new agenda for the Commission , establish more stringent priority in the pursuit of the goal of full employment , through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policy of the States , and , primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nation that have join the monetary union and which must be enable to become the first example of close cooperation . </s>
To this end , I shall confine myself to stress , out of all the choice available , the importance of three priority decision which should , in the drawing-up of action programme for the government of the Union , be the basis for both the Commission 's agenda and the action of the European union in the come month . </s>
firstly , the promotion of and participation in the draft of joint plan for the creation of an integrated service network in the transport and energy sector , with the backing of the European Investment Bank . </s>
secondly , the approval of investment - where the parameter be bind when draw up action programme on employment - to be make in individual country via Community project in the priority sector of research , innovation and training . </s>
I feel that these parameter - particularly those of a qualitative nature , result from investment in continuous training , refresher course , adaptability and retrain of old worker - be considerably more significant and binding owe to their lasting effect over the medium term than the simple draw up of annual quantitative objective , that be always debatable , regard new employment or employment cut . </s>
if , among other thing , as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stress as well , the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focus on an agree strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge , in other word , a strategy for employability and the definition of its rule , this would allow us to take a step towards have employee participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment process . </s>
thirdly , I do not think that the decrease in the number of the work population , owe to the age of the population , be unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union . </s>
this be not just because of the existence of margin which would permit an increase in the number of work woman and immigration , but because we need to be determine in reverse the widespread trend of early retirement from the job market , and direct the coordinate reform of social welfare system , certainly not towards large reduction in future pension payment but towards the active use of people 's increase life expectancy and towards a longer working life . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , you have come here today , Mr Prodi , in a very reformist and ambitious mood . </s>
I welcome you and your ambition . </s>
ambition will be need , give the mammoth task which await us . </s>
in order to make these reform , however , and in order to make progress with the @card@ legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strength of the reformer himself , but also of the opinion of other . </s>
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resource for the Commission , but the Commission must be aware that we be walk on thin financial ice . </s>
we have @card@ % of the Community 's GDP . </s>
not a euro more or a euro less . </s>
it will not be us who refuse these new resource . </s>
you should ask the Council . </s>
these financial perspective be adjust to within a millimetre . </s>
in order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulty we have have in approve the @card@ budget . </s>
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , do not like to finance new political initiative at the expense of exist one . </s>
the political priority must be set by this House and the MEPs . </s>
do not believe for one moment that your propose reform of the budget will disguise the limitation of the Community financial system . </s>
it be all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in term of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resource , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issue which must be resolve . </s>
we therefore wonder whether the Commission have the political will to resolve them . </s>
madam President , the Commission communication be well write but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever . </s>
on one hand , there be the word and , on the other , their real political meaning . </s>
we socialist applaud the Commission for want to fight against social exclusion and poverty . </s>
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be fill ? </s>
What be mean by the Commission 's declare objective of ' economic reform ' in the labour market ? </s>
do this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed-term contract ? </s>
Everyone know that quality of life and full and good employment depend on sustainable economic growth . </s>
the Union be currently restrict to a policy of stability which be certainly necessary but insufficient . </s>
we socialist desperately want a European pact for growth and employment . </s>
the ingredient of this policy be well know . </s>
they be the stimulation of public and private investment , increase investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise . </s>
in this respect , the e-Europe initiative be to be welcome . </s>
in the world of new technology , the main danger remain that access to information will be easy the rich you be . </s>
the gulf which be open up everywhere be the main problem for our era . </s>
on one hand we have the exuberance of the financial market and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion . </s>
we be ask worker to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruit of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholder alone . </s>
the European Central Bank be keep very quiet about the staggering rate of return on financial asset , yet it never miss an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity . </s>
How do we explain to worker who fall victim to the rationalisation of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepare to change career several time in their work life when the captain of industry , have lose the gamble of a take-over , leave with compensation of EUR @card@ million ? </s>
for year we have be tell over and over that the economy must be liberalise . </s>
the sector which have be liberalise be experience an avalanche of merger and acquisition , lead inevitably to monopoly situation . </s>
All these stock market battle be base solely on forecast increase in profit of @card@ % , @card@ % or @card@ % which be unrealistic in the long term . </s>
the unfettered rise in price of financial asset and property mean that the risk be on the increase . </s>
the main danger await us in the medium term be not inflation but deflation cause by the collapse of the speculative bubble on the international financial market . </s>
To conclude , the next five year will be crucial . </s>
we need new rule to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people . </s>
we need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper have two clear weakness . </s>
There be no point in draw up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finish the old one . </s>
I be think of transport policy and regional policy . </s>
you have excellent commissioner for both issue in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these area . </s>
and do you know why ? </s>
just look at transport policy ; clearly it be crucial for this policy to be draw up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other country . </s>
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say , although of course he have no obligation to do so . </s>
let me give you three example . </s>
First : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the road to the railway . </s>
that make sense from an economic and an ecological point of view . </s>
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy . </s>
the same apply to European air traffic control . </s>
our citizen can understand that we be deregulate air traffic , but leave @card@ different sector in the sky which be under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the airline and which pollute the environment . </s>
you still have not finish that agenda . </s>
commissioner , far too little be say in your paper about regional policy . </s>
economic and social cohesion in the Eu be a fundamental task of this Community . </s>
if we fail to complete it , citizen in less favour region will dread enlargement . </s>
we must show them that we intend to use the next five year to help them join the rich region by promote the less favour region use reasonable mean . </s>
then they too will be prepare to really support enlargement and help to achieve it . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor region , then this Union will be all the poor and it will not meet with the approval of the people . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the fact that we be formulate new programme do not mean that we should neglect those old programme which be at implementation stage . </s>
from that standpoint , it be useful that the Commission 's work programme come back to the issue of Agenda @card@ , the common agricultural policy , which include fishing , and secondly , the activity of the structural fund . </s>
I hope this reference mean that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitor and implement Agenda @card@ . </s>
the agenda @card@ issue be , of course , one that relate to your third and fourth strategic objective , the economic and social agenda and a good quality of life . </s>
What your text do not make apparent be the extent to which these major , high-minded objective be compatible with the resource that the Commission intend to deploy . </s>
I do not necessarily mean financial resource . </s>
the implementation of Agenda @card@ in the agricultural sector do not ultimately require more money . </s>
There must also be saving . </s>
but what we need be the analytical resource : these issue require the investment of more intellectual capital . </s>
this be because it be essential to achieve two thing : the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secure , and this must be do in a way which facilitate the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural product , mainly to the benefit of develop country . </s>
it be not easy to combine those aim . </s>
There be no obvious way . </s>
There may well be contradiction between the two objective and there be nothing to show that the Commission have point out those contradiction and how it propose to deal with them . </s>
as regard the other aspect of Agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievement to point to , but there be still less develop region , particularly island region , to which more attention should be pay . </s>
as for fishing , there be nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing ground , which have go as far as to wipe out entire specie of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future . </s>
perhaps these issue should be approach with great attention and a great esprit de finesse . </s>
madam President , I want to start by reinforce the caution that have be express by many colleague here in address this five-year plan . </s>
in set very ambitious long-term goal we must not take our eye away from the present . </s>
that be a point make very forcibly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address . </s>
the Union must not take on a whole range of new task without the basic foundation for a successful European economy be in place . </s>
that foundation be clearly the single market . </s>
How strongly be the single market establish at the moment ? </s>
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleague who be still here , of the finding of the Commission 's own survey among @card@ European business . </s>
nearly @card@ % of business in this survey be still report additional cost to render product or service compatible with national specification . </s>
this be the Commission 's own survey . </s>
these be the classic symptom of continued obstruction by national government - bureaucratic red-tape block market entry . </s>
the Commission 's programme show a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market . </s>
we have to keep the pressure up in all area by remove further barrier , intensify pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measure and , of course , extend into crucial new area like financial service . </s>
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieve . </s>
an enlarged Europe must build on the existing strength of the Union . </s>
the single market extend across that enlarged Union be go to be a colossal achievement . </s>
I conclude by say , on behalf of all my Conservative colleague - and we be the second large national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieve this historic task . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , lady and gentleman , at the time of our vote on your appointment we invite you to come here today . </s>
the serious business be therefore now go to start as we be to vote on your programme . </s>
from your speech I will concentrate on what you have call the new governance , which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizen . </s>
yet this new governance simply mean how the institution and our public authority operate , if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority . </s>
the interlink of the Eu institution , the responsibility of the Member States and the local and regional authority be all very well . </s>
yet be this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction ? </s>
be this really how we will answer the fundamental question which be not so much about ' who do what ' but more ' what be we do together ' ? </s>
it be these question which cause concern among our fellow citizen . </s>
in your speech you mention the challenge of globalisation and enlargement which await us . </s>
I would add to these the future of our social model . </s>
this be why I and my group be so firmly insist on the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
the reason our timetable include the draft of this Charter be because we be at a key point in our history . </s>
our Union need to redefine the value on which it be base , both within its current border and also with a view to the imminent enlargement which we earnestly desire , but not under just any condition . </s>
our people expect more Europe , but not just any Europe . </s>
they be expect us not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation . </s>
in this respect I must say that , in term of your commitment to a political union , to which we be favourable , this can be achieve unless it be base on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to well regulate the business of this world . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I should like to start with a quote : &quot; the Commission will continue to work towards establish a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposal to bring about an ambitious programme . </s>
the Commission be plan in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration . </s>
it wish to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all form of crime &quot; . </s>
that be the entire programme for the next five year on the question of internal security , freedom , citizen ' right and judicial cooperation . </s>
a paper this short be a farce . </s>
a farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper be a blatant contradiction to how thing actually stand . </s>
a paper such as this be no basis for a scoreboard . </s>
it have be extol and celebrate as a huge achievement and I be all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard . </s>
we here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme . </s>
What we be look for be minimum standard in asylum procedure so that refugee can be give help quickly , and those who be not flee know where they stand . </s>
we want instrument to prevent abuse . </s>
we want to develop a Community immigration policy which take account of the Member States ' capacity to absorb immigrant and we need to extend the operational power of EUROPOL , for example , so that specific step can be take to combat organise crime . </s>
we debate these issue intensively and seriously and we should be entitle to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it be merely submit a paper . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation , on which there be a broad convergence of view between the Commission document and the position of the Socialist Group . </s>
this be not the case in other area , as have already be point out . </s>
we share these view because we be in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conduct accord to common standard , common rule which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind . </s>
this aim be that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmonious development in which the value of citizenship do not only apply to the world 's most dynamic and competitive region . </s>
on the other hand , what do this statement tell us about principle ? </s>
this regulation and these standard have bring an increase volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation , in other word , increase wealth , but when we look at how this wealth be distribute , we see , unfortunately , that the gulf between the world 's rich country and block and the poor and least developed country continue to increase . </s>
it be therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standard and rule serve ? </s>
What good be the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation work , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problem and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor country to grow ? </s>
that be why we say that we be in favour of the strategy that the Commission outline here for the Seattle negotiation and for late one . </s>
we be certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious . </s>
we need to be demand and ensure that social right , environmental right and consumer protection be incorporate into the forthcoming negotiation . </s>
most importantly though , we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform , not just of the WTO but also of the Ilo , the United Nations and above all , of the financial institution , specifically the IMF and the World Bank . </s>
we must be brave and not only see some aspect of globalisation . </s>
we must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth do not only benefit the most highly-developed block and country , but that there be also harmonious change and development in every region in the world . </s>
madam President , I would also like to welcome the Commission 's initiative of present us with a report on its strategic objective for the next five year , although I hope that it intend , in subsequent document , to avoid the excess of generalisation and the vagueness of the text which we be examine today . </s>
have say this , Madam President , I be prepare , once again , to be a voice cry in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy . </s>
it be really surprising that the Commission do not treat the revision of one of its common policy as a strategic objective for the come year , in view of the reform which must take place in @card@ . </s>
There be no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many year . </s>
however , it seem that the Commission do not share this view , although it be the commission which be oblige to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fishery policy over the last decade before the end of @card@ , and it be on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decision with regard to its modification . </s>
in fact , the revision process have already begin for many body and institution , such as the European Parliament , which in @card@ already issue and adopt a report point out all the current problem and deficiency of the common fishery policy . </s>
we have often ask for a basic timetable for this revision and we have receive no reply . </s>
Less than two year be not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy be anomalous with regard to the internal market regulation and that such anomaly should be resolve within the framework of this reform process . </s>
therefore , Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I would ask that this issue , which be of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union , be take into account in this strategy and these strategic objective for the next five year . </s>
madam President , I should like to add my congratulation to Commissioner Prodi 's programme . </s>
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of have sustain growth : the information society in an expand European market with the addition of a fully function single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable job for our European citizen . </s>
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regard Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that be that it be a little weak on the actual content of economic policy . </s>
we must not take anything for grant in term of how we get the European economy restructure . </s>
after all , what be social justice if it be without full employment ? </s>
full employment be the good way to generate social justice for our citizen . </s>
this be a key priority for us to focus on . </s>
I should like to welcome one or two initiative that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to have an innovative knowledge-driven economy . </s>
yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new job . </s>
I welcome the Commission initiative now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprise and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on have a charter for micro-businesses . </s>
that be important and something that can be develop through the Lisbon Summit . </s>
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union . </s>
again , this be a way that we can help create good opportunity for job and for prosperity . </s>
you say in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keep inflation low , innovation , science and technology be central for the future success of the European economy and create job . </s>
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for grant . </s>
There be still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that . </s>
so with those remark I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to focus on two point which be not mention in your programme . </s>
To me , this Commission strategy paper for the next five year read like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle . </s>
unfortunately , it do not give the impression of be a real political strategy on the part of the Commission . </s>
as the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expect more in the way of agenda from an Italian president of the Commission . </s>
the Commission give no soul to Europe . </s>
culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe . </s>
just a few main point . </s>
I be talk about the integration of the policy of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create job . </s>
I be talk about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy area , about consolidate and improve the European dimension of training and education syllabus and about network training and education policy in Europe especially lifelong learning . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , it be the new millennium and you make no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe . </s>
nor be any mention make of information policy and communication cater to the need of our citizen . </s>
it seem to me that something be miss from this programme . </s>
truly European citizenship depend on our create a real , visible area of training and culture . </s>
declaration of principle be not enough . </s>
we need an agenda which can be translate into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just describe . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you have to make direct choice ? </s>
you have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the election , or rather the turnout at the next European election . </s>
when I think that I have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constituent , not in the rarefy atmosphere of this House , but on the street , then I ask myself , what can I say ? </s>
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what be there that be new ? </s>
There be nothing new in your work programme . </s>
you have take @card@ page for five year and @card@ page for one year 's work programme . </s>
do that give me hope for the year @card@ ? </s>
no , it do not ! </s>
in your work programme for @card@ you state something quite clever . </s>
you say that environmental consideration must be integrate into all other policy area . </s>
have you do so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ? </s>
no , you have not do so . </s>
you have not integrate environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problem of enlargement . </s>
nor have you integrate it into economic policy , competition or the internal market . </s>
you have not integrate it anywhere . </s>
you have tack a few component together but you have no overall structure . </s>
you say earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube be an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , Mr Prodi , we need , at long last , to start transpose legislation and ensure that legislation be monitor . </s>
you say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standard to be high and good foodstuff legislation . </s>
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you be talk about . </s>
the foodstuff legislation in the European Union be the most ambitious in the world . </s>
where it fall short , what be miss , be transposition in the Member States and monitoring . </s>
it be time you take your job seriously , it be time for you , as President of the Commission , to box the Member States on the ear and force them to do their work and fulfil their duty . </s>
it be no good spending time on hobby when there be a day 's work to be do . </s>
that be what we expect of you in the next five year . </s>
. </s>
( ES ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , as chairman of this Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries , Mr Prodi , you be not make thing easy for me at all . </s>
I feel duty bind to publicly denounce the fact that fishing be absent from the programme which you have present to us . </s>
the next five year of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusion - will mean great change . </s>
I hope that this change will not mean an even great marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , be deafen . </s>
not a single line , nor a single word , refer to fishing or the CFP . </s>
I be not ask for detail or specific point , but I believe that a mention be require . </s>
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affect the economic and social cohesion of Europe ? </s>
this be all the more serious , if that be possible - as other have say - bear in mind that your Commission , Mr Prodi , have to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fishery policy , which you be legally require to do in @card@ . </s>
do the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it have announce nothing - about this reform in @card@ either ? </s>
What message can we send to the fisherman of Europe , and their family , and the fishing industry , both the extractive and processing and marketing industry , and the related and secondary industry which depend on fishing in so many European port , in so many European region , in most case peripheral region , who rightly demand that this problem be deal with as a priority ? </s>
you have make an explicit reference to the cap for the come year , but you have not do so for the CFP , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which be necessary to prevent exception - as have already be say - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation . </s>
this House have express its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second . </s>
I would therefore ask you , Mr Prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today . </s>
our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you . </s>
Mr President of the Commission , this be indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-year programme follow the crisis of the Commission . </s>
on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform . </s>
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it be now lay down in a consultative document and which be also include in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission . </s>
we consider it to be of utmost importance that , in term of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts , we can expect swift line of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen . </s>
at the same time , we be aware that this be a massive programme and that , during the overhaul in the next couple of year , it will be necessary to keep the actual result come in , as before . </s>
much like in the Netherlands , where , at a give point , woman wake up to the fact that , by refer to European legislation , they could improve their status in term of social security , this be now also the case for score of other citizen . </s>
they want to see result . </s>
Democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to result , citizen value result and this be what the Commission be judge on . </s>
this be exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other member make : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual lose his own sense of safety and security . </s>
this can be prevent if a European social model be draw up and if result be achieve in all these concrete area . </s>
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which deliver fast and concrete result at a social level . </s>
this give the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere . </s>
because this citizen - one in five globally - still have no access to elementary social provision , such as education and health care . </s>
these be really the people who deserve our solidarity . </s>
madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commission 's document set out the strategic objective for its term in office . </s>
I be delighted that it be be discuss in Parliament , but I also note the compromise and the omission in it . </s>
the Commission make only a pass reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union 's regional policy . </s>
and this be true even when it address the issue of enlargement . </s>
be reduce the disparity between level of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objective that we have already achieve ? </s>
certainly not ! </s>
at the same time , it be rightly point out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with develop country , and strengthen its activity design for fight poverty . </s>
this document leave out issue which clearly should have be include . </s>
I think the fact that the Commission do not address the issue of cohesion be extremely serious . </s>
it play down one of the treaty ' principle - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institution ' policy and measure . </s>
it seem to ignore the fact that various European region be still considerably less advanced than other . </s>
it also forget that enlargement mean that we must get regional policy right . </s>
unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the European union itself will be at risk . </s>
we should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the region in the European Union , for which the Commission be responsible . </s>
this report confirm that whereas an average level of development be give a rating of @card@ , the ten so-called &quot; strong &quot; region reach an average of @card@ , and the ten so-called &quot; weak &quot; region reach a figure of around @card@ . </s>
you may draw your own conclusion . </s>
@card@ be exactly the level of development of my own region , the Azores , one of the region define in the treaty as ultra-peripheral . </s>
I be wait for the Commission 's report on the ultra-peripheral region , which the Council decide should be draw up by December @card@ . </s>
I shall finish by restate my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only disunity . </s>
madam President , Mr Prodi , Europe need a strong Commission . </s>
as intend by the treaty and the will of the people , the Commission be the drive force of European construction which be like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement . </s>
we therefore need a strong Commission but one which rely on the support of a parliament . </s>
this House be therefore your ally but not one which be too accommodate . </s>
you must therefore listen to our opinion , one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech . </s>
firstly , Mr President , although your two predecessor concentrate on develop an internal market and establish the single currency , it have be leave to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which be at the heart of European construction . </s>
you must not allow yourself to be distract by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be . </s>
you must go further , towards reconcile the people with Europe , in particular those people who be fall victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological division . </s>
the promotion of scientific development and new technology and access for all to these technology will not be provide by the market or competition . </s>
the latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community service of health , education , transport , communication , water and whatever else . </s>
your action programme and your objective be reserve , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which be need . </s>
this be also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest service . </s>
this be an absolute priority if you be to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider . </s>
madam President , the Commission be correct to make food safety one of its top priority . </s>
the recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continue controversy over the safety of genetically-modified food , have all contribute to undermine consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat . </s>
if the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institution themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the right of Eu citizen . </s>
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence feature prominently in the Commission 's work programme for @card@ . </s>
however , I be disappoint with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper . </s>
in its present form , what be be propose be more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making power more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration , which have already establish credibility in this particular field . </s>
furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authority of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland . </s>
this body , for example , alongside the recently establish cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , be already do good work . </s>
it would be a tragedy if their effort be to be undermine by deficiency in Eu legislation . </s>
my fear be that such deficiency in Eu legislation could lead to turf war between national and Eu body , who should be work together rather than against one another . </s>
that be something we must guard against . </s>
madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today have necessarily be a fairly broad brush affair . </s>
we will be look for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be unveil this year . </s>
we will also be look at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be apply a number of test . </s>
we will be look at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combine economic policy , employment policy and social policy . </s>
at the moment , social policy be trail well behind economic and employment policy . </s>
within the employment strategy we will look for a deepen and broaden of the strategy follow the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework be propose by the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
within the social dimension we will be look for a deepen of the internal market with a social aspect . </s>
the spate of merger , takeover and transfer that we be experience with the deepen of the market mean that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directive that we have adopt in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an update of the work council directive . </s>
we also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that company in fact work in partnership with their worker in the management of change . </s>
that be the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that be put into place . </s>
finally , with the emergence , the resurgence , of the xenophobic right within the European union I hope that our institution together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by use Article @card@ to combat discrimination , and Article @card@ to combat exclusion . </s>
we need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now . </s>
the aspiration be fine , President Prodi , we want those aspiration to be match by action . </s>
madam President , I hope that it be a good omen that there be still a few i 's leave for me to dot . </s>
Mr Prodi , you set great store in your reform effort on introduce a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe . </s>
however , for the economic sector which I represent , i. e. fishery , this means change . </s>
we need to break away from planned economy subsidy in favour of a liberal policy which foster personal responsibility . </s>
we must reduce protective tariff in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertaking in the processing industry . </s>
What it come down to be the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousand of job in the processing industry and offshore fishing . </s>
however , I be sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which be both an economic and a social factor , which affect not only Germany but all the coastal region of Europe . </s>
plus , this branch of the economy be one of the few sector in which Europe have fully integrate power to decide and act , which be why we expect to be give a right of codecision here too . </s>
this have since be unanimously approve . </s>
the fishery policy be due for review in a few month ' time , i. e. at the beginning of the year @card@ . </s>
so it be somewhat upset that there be not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy be this paper . </s>
I hope that this be a misunderstanding . </s>
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promise . </s>
madam President , many of the speaker from the Socialist Group have already identify key area where there be gap in the Commission 's statement . </s>
however , we have acknowledge that this be an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission . </s>
One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identify , be that of cultural diversity in Europe . </s>
the introduction to this statement acknowledge under the quality of life section that it be important . </s>
but there be nothing in the statement which indicate that the Commission intend to take any step to deal with the issue of cultural diversity . </s>
if we be to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seek power on the back of anxious citizen - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotype that we have of each other , both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other part of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe . </s>
unless we address these issue , unless we dismantle these negative stereotype , unless we take what be good from our various culture and language and protect and expand it and ensure that we be serious about have a diverse Europe , we will fail . </s>
those who be currently come to the fore in Europe base on fear will win the day . </s>
I be seriously concern that unless the Commission recognise that this be an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizen will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand . </s>
if we do not take step to deal with that , we will fail ultimately . </s>
thank you , Mr De Rossa . </s>
before give the floor again to the President of the Commission , I must tell you that I have receive , pursuant to Rule @card@ , seven motion for resolution to conclude the debate . </s>
. </s>
( it ) Madam President , lady and gentleman , thank you for this strong , serious and constructive debate . </s>
it have be a calm debate with broad agreement over the basic point , but also where there have be a marked reassertion of Parliament 's right and of the need for cooperation and dialogue between Parliament , the Commission and the Council . </s>
it have be a constructive debate for Europe . </s>
the document that I have present have be describe as a political manifesto with some internal contradiction . </s>
Mrs Hautala , I think you be almost right in say this , because it be indeed a political manifesto . </s>
but it be not some abstract political manifesto , but a manifestation of political will which we need at this delicate stage for Europe . </s>
it be pointless to say that Europe be in crisis if we be then unable to issue a political manifesto , to discuss it , to dwell on it and to draw conclusion on it together . </s>
so the contradiction between objective and instrument which Mrs Hautala rightly point out , reflect contradiction in the current state of affair in Europe . </s>
these be the contradiction that it be our duty to rectify and overcome . </s>
this be the importance of the political task we must tackle today . </s>
I have bring them out into the open without hide anything . </s>
I be please that they have be give such prominence and also , sometimes , be assert so forcefully , be give such importance , and this be why we want to change the instrument that we use to guide our action , Parliament 's action , my action , the action of all the European institution ; this be why we want an effective Intergovernmental Conference ; this be why Helsinki signify a time of delicate change . </s>
it have be write that we have give up the drive towards a strong Europe , but then in Helsinki we rekindle the flame that we have manage to keep go until then . </s>
cast your mind back - I recall this because it take place in this very Chamber - to the speech give by the President of the French Republic on the issue of reinforce cooperation which reopen a dialogue that appear close prior to this . </s>
I hope our tenacity in maintain our position in Helsinki will be reward at the Intergovernmental Conference , which will culminate with the Nice Summit . </s>
we have be remind by everyone - not just by Mr Poettering and Mr Fiori , but many speaker - of globalisation and the difficulty this be cause us in our life and policy . </s>
the Commission want globalisation . </s>
it see it as positive because it be provide a minimum amount of dignity for billion of people marginalised by the global market , and because it be thank to globalisation that a new day be dawn in China and India for , I repeat , billion of people . </s>
I hope that globalisation will continue to have this positive aspect in the future , but - and this be go to be one of our major commitment in the future - it lead to problem in poor country and in our country , problem that we must address . </s>
and it also lead to problem in the weak sector of our country . </s>
this mean examine our conscience over the practical action we must take from day to day , because it be clear that globalisation be cause our society to diverge , increase poverty , give more ground for anger , cause wide difference in salary , even in sector which seem similar , and we need to focus our attention on this . </s>
clearly , when our young graduate notice difference in salary , small or large depend on the type of employment they be in , and when the financial sector pay wage that be X number of time high than someone work in research , for example , all of this create problem relate to the organisation of our future society . </s>
we need to deliberate carefully over this , and - I be respond to Mr Trentin - frankly we still have not , or at least I still have not prepare a complete response in this regard . </s>
I start to respond in Lisbon , by attempt to reduce the marginalisation of an entire age group , that be , to provide all the young people of Europe with new instrument for communication , broadly reunite all the European school and create new opportunity to prevent geographical and social marginalisation in Europe . </s>
this still do not go far enough towards control globalisation , or at least understand the consequence of globalisation , but it be a substantial and necessary response . </s>
in recent week , Commissioner Lamy also vigorously propose a response at global level on behalf of the Commission : to rebuild confidence in the development of the Third World that be put in such serious jeopardy at Seattle and to repropose a role for the WTO with a wide agenda able to address the challenge of globalisation . </s>
in Geneva , the Commission propose an extraordinarily bold short-term packet which comply with many of your request . </s>
it propose unilaterally reduce custom duty to zero for the @card@ poor country - unilaterally , completely and across the board ; it propose reform the WTO 's procedure and great transparency ; it propose give a response to the develop country over issue relate to the promotion of this measure . </s>
if these measure gain support over the next few day , the Commission - as it have already announce - will vigorously proceed with the relaunch of the Round for summer , and therefore its resumption . </s>
we be try to repair the damage do in Seattle . </s>
this be the Commission 's major task , and together , we plan to reform the WTO and establish a place for the Commission within it , and the Commission will at last study the matter in great depth because it have not be do in recent year . </s>
this be an initial practical response in a five-year programme , which be not there to provide response on individual issue but to provide these major policy line , extract from our future action , extract where Parliament 's supervision be essential , as be collaboration between Parliament and the Commission . </s>
the synergy between the Commission , Parliament and the Council be essential , Mr Cox . </s>
clearly this will compel us , as we have see and as be the subject of a large part of my intervention , to rethink the concept of subsidiarity . </s>
I be grateful to Mr Poettering , Mr Cox and the other who mention this . </s>
this be the cornerstone of the programme . </s>
too often , subsidiarity have be laud in theory but have not be understand in practice . </s>
we must give subsidiarity a material body and a political soul : this be the aim of the White Paper , which must put value back into Europe and recommend what practical action to undertake . </s>
I do not want to devalue Europe , Mr Dell ' Alba . </s>
I do not want to do shed the power to implement common policy ; on the contrary , I want to consolidate , accelerate and improve the decision and implementation of common policy , but at the same time I want to prevent our mechanism become flood with a large number of disjointed policy which , in reality , have little that be ' common ' about them . </s>
let us remember how often we have be make into a laughing-stock because we deal with thing that be absolutely ridiculous , which defy common sense and conflict with the interest of our population . </s>
regard this matter and this transformation , the Commission can and must be a real leader , relieve of useless burden , give more credibility because it take tangible form in its &quot; core business &quot; and because it do not make request but instead reject unnecessary task and power . </s>
the Commission must become a drive force . </s>
as Mr Cox say , we should be an &quot; enable Europe &quot; not an &quot; include Europe &quot; , but very often we have be an &quot; enable Europe &quot; on the one hand and an &quot; include Europe &quot; on the other . </s>
my second guarantee be that these be not empty proposal . </s>
we have start work on them , not just as regard the internal reform of the Commission , together with Commissioner Kinnock , but also in some initial reform of the structure of individual policy . </s>
I shall give you an example : if there be one policy that be important to the Commission , it be competition policy . </s>
well , we have present - and in January this House support these hypothesis with an overwhelming majority - a programme for reform which will allow the Commission to concentrate on the fight against the most serious and important breach of competition policy at European level , and we have begin a process of major cooperation with the national authority on this . </s>
we have do the same thing in the White Paper regard the food sector . </s>
I have hear this be criticise - and I understand the criticism - that it be &quot; have less power than American Food and Drug Administration &quot; . </s>
well of course it do ! </s>
I want to use the national authority which be already active in this area . </s>
if I have use an organisational model such as the American one , you would now be rebel and say , &quot; you have set up yet another centralise structure in Brussels ! </s>
&quot; this be Europe : this delicate balance between exist national structure which must be enhance and put in a network with the European authority , and not humiliate by its presence . </s>
just as enlargement be a difficult challenge , this be too because it have never before be attempt . </s>
I welcome this broad unity over enlargement . </s>
There have hardly be any difference of opinion during this morning 's debate , and I welcome that because enlargement be a decision that be go to entail sacrifice for us and great change within ourselves . </s>
at the time of the actual decision , here , we shall all have to be unite in order to demonstrate that enlargement be in the interest of peace , prosperity and be take place by way of a guarantee , as I say before , for our people , in addition to a guarantee for the country which be attempt to enlarge . </s>
I have no intention to proceed to an enlargement process that be not serious , strong and , above all - Mrs Muscardini be very attentive and make a justified remark about this - enlargement must not produce two type of member : the importance of enlargement stem precisely from the fact that , once a country join this Union , it be the same as all the other . </s>
I say that we be a unity of minority , a union of minority : this be the extraordinary thing about the European Union . </s>
but enlargement be also about be strict . </s>
I be remind about the nuclear power station and the Danube . </s>
I have just be to Lithuania , Slovakia and Romania , three country where we have have to request nuclear power station to be close . </s>
we do this , mindful of the serious problem for the local economy , but we explain that these be Europe 's rule and that this be a safety measure which everyone have to and will have to adopt . </s>
these country understand that we have help their transformation . </s>
they have undertake to close the nuclear power plant , which be an enormous sacrifice for them . </s>
but this be Europe . </s>
why the sacrifice ? </s>
so that the goal , which be in the common interest , can be achieve . </s>
it be also important to reach an agreement over Africa . </s>
I have hear a lot of impassioned intervention about Africa , which I also mention in my speech because Africa be one of the cross we have to bear : Africa be neglect by everyone . </s>
I would remind you of the long journey the American President make in recent year which bring hope for a time , but then nothing come of it . </s>
Africa be principally one of our problem . </s>
naturally , it be include in the hierarchy of the analysis of foreign policy we mention earlier ; enlargement , the Mediterranean , Ukraine , Russia and the question of Africa , which be under discussion . </s>
preparation for the Summit be progress , but there be enormous difficulty : there be terrible division in Africa , and I be try to reduce them too : I be try to heal the rift because if they remain , it would become impossible to launch a major policy to help such a desperate Africa . </s>
the Task Force in the development DG be cooperate closely with the external relation DG in order to include new sector in their work on Africa too . </s>
we be start to cooperate in the communication , education and science sector . </s>
if we do not act in these sector of civilisation , it will be impossible for Africa to act . </s>
nevertheless , I be aware that we be still at the beginning and I would therefore ask for a great deal of openness and help from everyone . </s>
I have also be rebuke for not have mention certain important sector such as fishery . </s>
it be true , I do not mention fishery , and I do not even mention agriculture , school or the whole of the major social policy on the elderly . </s>
I do not mention it because I believe that the five-year programme must set out the major policy line regard general development , but I be convince of its enormous importance for cohesion and European solidarity . </s>
I assure you that there will be a commitment in this area because it be clear that it be a piece of the important mosaic that we have outline in today 's debate . </s>
it be precisely with these essential function , with which we must ensure respect for our irreplaceable , political and moral role at Europe 's helm , that the Commission must strive to show the advantage and cost of our policy and to be very clear for a population that ask us for clarity , that ask us to be absolutely transparent . </s>
in this regard , I be reassure and encourage by this debate . </s>
it reassure me because I have perceive a broad consensus on the basic line of our programme and because I have the impression that its true substance have be understand . </s>
it have be a calm debate , as I say at the start , but not modest : on the contrary , it have be a debate with only a high political profile . </s>
so while the term &quot; manifesto &quot; might sound negative , it do , nevertheless , have an important value of its own and a sound political content . </s>
we have talk to each other with a language that Mr Barón Crespo describe as plain and accessible . </s>
it emerge clearly , but forcefully that the challenge before us be the great political challenge that we must tackle together . </s>
this make close collaboration between Parliament and the Commission even more important . </s>
I be encourage by this . </s>
There be those who have not be persuade by the debate , such as Mr Wurtz , who say in his statement that he welcome the constructive spirit and add : &quot; we have five year to succeed &quot; . </s>
we be ready to collaborate . </s>
this be what I want , Mr Cox , and not because I have ever notice I be live in a honeymoon period . </s>
you say that the honeymoon be over . </s>
I remember the honeymoon as be somewhat different , from the month we spend together , but I be pleased you use this term . </s>
in any case , this debate have further convince me that the major challenge that lie ahead be political challenge . </s>
they require great energy , energy that will need to be intensify as the synergy between the institution grow . </s>
I would like to conclude by pick up on something Mr Barón Crespo mention . </s>
he mention something that be very important to me : Ambrogio Lorenzetti 's fresco on good government , in Siena . </s>
if you recall , it be a fresco where everything work . </s>
There be people work , merchant , and hierarchy which can easily be see in that Sienese society . </s>
it be a real five-year programme of the Community of Siena ; it be their document whereby they try to describe the society of the time . </s>
we can but admire this , because after all , it could serve as a point of reference . </s>
and Mr Barón Crespo , we can forget that the five-year programme be unable to exert any practical influence in the world ; it disappear from political manifesto when Siena 's role in the world weaken . </s>
I think that we must avoid this danger . </s>
welcome I would like to inform you that there be a delegation from Kuwait , lead by his Excellency , Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah , Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister , here in the official gallery . </s>
on behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament . </s>
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activity organise today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistant to be adopt as soon as possible . </s>
I understand that on @card@ January the association write to the College of Quaestors request permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative . </s>
on the same day , I understand , Mr Balfe give permission for the assistant to go ahead . </s>
the Parliament service ask to meet with the assistant yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangement . </s>
however , the appointment be cancel at the last minute . </s>
Parliament have not yet indicate why permission be withdraw . </s>
Mrs Banotti apparently promise to write a letter explain why permission be withdraw but so far no letter have be receive . </s>
Can you explain why the approval give to the assistant be withdraw at the last minute ? </s>
do you agree that the assistant have a legitimate case which must be hear ? </s>
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellation do not happen again ? </s>
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistant be adopt as soon as possible ? </s>
finally , will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament 's rule be properly implement and that assistant be pay , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ? </s>
without them we would not be able to function . </s>
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order . </s>
be there any rule or regulation that govern demonstration within the building of this Parliament , outside the door of the hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs be free to come into this hemicycle to discharge their mandate ? </s>
if there be such rule , who have the responsibility for enforce them and what be they do to discharge that responsibility ? </s>
Mr President , I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistant , which we have always consider to be a priority , and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , Mr Barón Crespo , we have forward the contract that we draw up with the assistant to the Quaestors . </s>
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway . </s>
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the member to do likewise . </s>
Mr President , first of all let me say that I be in full support of a statute for assistant . </s>
yesterday when I arrive in Parliament I be hand a document relate to a propose demonstration by the assistant outside the door of Parliament . </s>
as all colleague will know - and many of you have approach me over the last six month - all exhibition and such like be filter first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament . </s>
To give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibition can be hold here in Parliament for obvious reason . </s>
follow a letter I receive yesterday , I immediately inform the assistant that we would propose that they be allow to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month . </s>
but all exhibition must be carry out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament . </s>
I sign a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament , in which the assistant be inform of this . </s>
but I be also tell that they be inform verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of group last Thursday , so they be fully aware of the decision . </s>
There be no problem with them tell us the way they feel , there be no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament 's next part-session . </s>
but there be some misunderstanding , for they do receive a letter from somebody else that they feel give them permission . </s>
but all exhibition be in fact look at first by the so-called Comart committee . </s>
as you can see we have many exhibition around Parliament , whether they be about different country or whatever . </s>
this be not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistant . </s>
thank you , Mrs Banotti . </s>
I think your intervention may clarify various point that be raise . </s>
Mr President , I want to point out an important matter of principle . </s>
I personally believe that it be nothing short of scandalous that we hear member of this Parliament attack the demonstration rather than look at the solution to the problem , which be fair condition , fair pay and fair hour . </s>
we shall now proceed to the vote.1 Vote ( Parliament reject the motion for a resolution ) Motion for a resolution ( B5-0119 / @card@ ) &quot; Area of freedom , security and justice &quot; ( Parliament adopt the resolution ) Report ( A5-0026 / @card@ ) by Mr McCarthy , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States lay down guideline for a Community Initiative concern economic and social regeneration of city and of neighbourhood in crisis in order to promote sustainable urban development ( Urban ) [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0242 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] ( Parliament adopt the resolution ) Report ( A5-0028 / @card@ ) by Mr Decourrière , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States lay down guideline for a Community Initiative concern trans-European cooperation intend to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the European territory ( INTERREG ) [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0243 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] ( Parliament adopt the resolution ) Report ( A5-0024 / @card@ ) by Mr Procacci , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States lay down guideline for the Community initiative for rural development ( Leader + ) [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0259 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] ( Parliament adopt the resolution ) explanation of Vote - Resolution &quot; area of freedom , security and justice &quot; Berthu ( UEN ) . </s>
( FR ) the resolution which the European Parliament have just adopt on immigration policy , despite the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voting against this , retroactively justify all the fear which we express when the Treaty of Amsterdam be ratify . </s>
this House have be utterly lax on the substance and yet , at the same time , be ask for ever great decision-making power to the detriment of the national parliament . </s>
the combination of these two position make for a mixture which could be disastrous for the future for Europe . </s>
I count no less than seven call in the resolution , at different point , for equal right for European citizen and legal immigrant . </s>
this have become a real obsession . </s>
as for the fight against illegal immigration , this House be hardly interested . </s>
There be absolutely nothing in the resolution on border control . </s>
even when the question of Eurodac or readmission clause be briefly mention , it be only to deplore the over-strictness of the Council on these subject . </s>
yet the standard call for a fund for refugee , finance from the Community budget , be there . </s>
finally , the European Parliament call for a review of immigration policy in view of the population situation . </s>
it be clear what this mean . </s>
at the same time , the resolution call for new codecision power for the European Parliament on immigration . </s>
you can imagine what would come of this . </s>
as be to be expect , the Commission have just lend its support in the opinion table for the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
our group believe that it would be dangerous to go down this road . </s>
instead , on these matter , we should stick with the people and national sovereignty . </s>
this be why the procedure of the first pillar on the single market must not be transpose exactly as they be for the area of security , justice or foreign policy . </s>
for these area , the Intergovernmental Conference must devise new cooperation procedure base on the political role of the Council and interparliamentary control exercise by the national parliament . </s>
Mr President , I be speak on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People 's Party , the delegation of the Spanish People 's Party , with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí 's resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
There have be some vote where we have not follow the guideline of the Group of the European People 's Party , and we have vote in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent . </s>
however , we have vote against paragraph 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect . </s>
on the other hand , we have vote in favour of Recital J which , in fact , be in line with what I , as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom , propose to that Committee , with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
we have also vote in favour of paragraph @card@ . </s>
an appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for resident of non-EU country be something which the Spanish people 's party have be advocate for some time . </s>
for similar reason , we have vote in favour of paragraph @card@ which , with the oral amendment , deal with certain very justifiable concern about the question of subsidiarity , since political right , not just vote in local election , but political right in general term , form part of the sovereignty of Member States . </s>
give the oral amendment , we feel we could vote in favour and that be what we have do . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the Danish Social Democratic member of the European Parliament have choose to vote in favour of the propose resolution , but be at the same time aware of the fact that certain area clash with the reservation Denmark have in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wish to respect . </s>
this report which I vote against be less concern with human right than with ' communitisation ' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe . </s>
the suppose progress achieve in @card@ and mention by the report only occur in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the right of immigrant . </s>
in term of human right , this be a backward step . </s>
Europe be continue to expel national arrive from country regard as dangerous by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . </s>
yet some applicant country in central and eastern Europe be take in Gypsy refugee expel en masse from Belgium . </s>
Kosovo Albanian and Serb deserter be be refuse refugee status , whereas Pinochet be calmly escape prosecution . </s>
the Europe of Schengen clearly find it much easy to hound the persecute from the south than dictator , even though the UN estimate that we will need @card@ million immigrant to maintain a stable population between now and the year @card@ . </s>
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrant and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all election . </s>
only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice . </s>
McCarthy report ( A5-0026 / @card@ ) Mr President , I would firstly like to point out that I be Mayor of Bilbao during the ninety , which give me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot project to be subsidise by the Commission . </s>
our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao lead us to four conclusion : firstly , that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore , far from reduce the EUR @card@ million for the last five year period to EUR @card@ million for this five year period , the funding of this project should be increase . </s>
this should be do , for example - and the Group of the green / European Free Alliance have propose this - by reinvest , in Urban project , that portion of the structural fund which each Member State have not spend within the time scale lay down for that purpose . </s>
secondly , when decide which area must be subsidise , we must concentrate effort on integrated project . </s>
disparate action be not effective . </s>
we have to select location by prioritising those which be most impoverished and needy , in accordance with the objective set , that be to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimension , as well as the relationship between them . </s>
thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergy generate by other Community programme , as well as the opportunity for sustainable development in the location or region in question . </s>
finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institution which be close to the citizen , that be , the local council and body . </s>
they have more first-hand knowledge of social need . </s>
they have more involvement in the problem and , furthermore , they know how to conceive project and implement them effectively without weigh them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve good result . </s>
lastly , in today 's vote on our four amendment , two have be approve and the other two reject . </s>
this have oblige us to abstain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when decide which project must be finance and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate , to Urban project , that portion of the structural fund which it have not spend in accordance with Community programme . </s>
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have an in-depth discussion on the Urban initiative which produce many idea . </s>
as the small community initiative in existence , we therefore propose an increase in its funding through an amendment which be reject . </s>
we regret this as there be actually money leave over from the structural fund in some country which could really have help with pilot project . </s>
we should remember that it be these Urban project which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be establish . </s>
the Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policy which be in place . </s>
it should make Urban project coherent with future project in budget line entitle ' sustainable urban policy ' . </s>
finally , there be currently still no European urban policy within the European Union . </s>
perhaps this point could be develop in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally have a true urban policy . </s>
Mr President , I would like to point out that I vote for this report on sustainable urban development , know as Urban . </s>
as with all other Community initiative , this be very positive . </s>
Europe be make its presence feel at a time when we be do something for all the citizen of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual state , whichever one it may be . </s>
urban be design to find solution to urban decay , and this be something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners ' Party . </s>
There can be no bad situation than that of an elderly person live in a city . </s>
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problem face by the elderly in city . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the Left 's five member of the European Parliament have choose to support Leader + , the Equal initiative and INTERREG , but not Urban . </s>
at a forthcoming review of these programme , it ought to be establish that the Eu 's effort be to be concentrate upon cross-border task and adapt to the possible enlargement of the Eu . </s>
. </s>
( da ) we have vote in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concern the guideline for a Community initiative relate to the economic and social regeneration of city and neighbourhood in crisis and design to promote sustainable development ( Urban ) . </s>
basically , we be oppose to programme and structural fund of this type but , since the vote only concern how - and not to what extent - these resource be to be use , we have confine ourselves to assess the content and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerate neighbourhood in crisis contain some sensible observation , as well as some good suggestion and criterion for the relevant project . </s>
this report contain general point on what be refer to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centre and neighbourhood affect by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequence , i. e. increase unemployment , exclusion and delinquency . </s>
it underline the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implement which do not leave out the main victim of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrant , refugee , woman and the socially exclude . </s>
however , nothing be say about the cause of this crisis and those responsible for it . </s>
at good this report simply correct certain aspect and effect of the crisis . </s>
yet only scandalously limited resource be available for this work . </s>
as the report itself indicate , the fund allocate to the Urban II programme for the @card@ period be approximately @card@ % less than those in the previous period , which be already low , at EUR @card@ million . </s>
add to this be the fact that only about fifty project be consider for the whole of Europe which be pathetic when practically all European city district , both suburban and inner city , be affect . </s>
this be why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measure plan to help certain social category which be most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consist of pious hope finance on the cheap . </s>
- ( FR ) Mrs McCarthy , lady and gentleman , I be very please that the Urban Community Initiative be be continue as this aim to support the social and economic conversion of city and neighbourhood in crisis , all with a view to achieve sustainable urban development . </s>
with some @card@ % of the population of Europe live in an urban area , city be at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in Europe . </s>
at the same time , the social and economic problem face European society be more pronounce in urban area . </s>
Many European city be divide into neighbourhood characterise by high-added-value activity and high-income resident and other district characterise by low income , high unemployment , substandard and overcrowd housing and high level of welfare dependency . </s>
the concentration of economic and social problem in certain urban area call for targeted intervention take full account of the complexity of the problem involve . </s>
this be why the European Parliament successfully call for the Urban Community Initiative or CIP to be extend during the reform of the structural fund . </s>
the success of Urban during the @card@ programming period be indisputable . </s>
the result be clear in term of the improvement of the quality of life in the target area . </s>
this CIP have encourage the development of good practice model in the economic , social and environmental sector . </s>
it have also have the distinction of strengthen the role of local authority , the non-governmental sector and local community and of support new partnership approach to urban regeneration . </s>
the new initiative will continue to pursue these goal by reinforce them , while particularly promote equal opportunity between man and woman and integrate socially marginalised and disadvantaged group . </s>
we can therefore welcome its adoption . </s>
we must , however , admit that in financial term we can proclaim a victory ! </s>
the total appropriation allocate be not up to the challenge . </s>
the amount for the @card@ period be EUR @card@ million and will be EUR @card@ million for the @card@ period . </s>
this represent a drop of @card@ % ! </s>
this reduction in funding have lead to a reduction in the number of programme in the new Urban initiative . </s>
the choose threshold of @card@ project seem too low . </s>
it need to be increase to reflect regional and local factor whilst maintain financial award to the Member States . </s>
in view of this concentration on a limited number of project , the publication and dissemination of the result of the new Urban Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect . </s>
the Commission 's proposal reduce the number of urban area that could benefit from the new Urban programme in the period @card@ from more than @card@ to only @card@ . </s>
it also reduce appropriation by @card@ % . </s>
Portugal will suffer unfairly as a result of this proposal , in spite of the fact that it already have great need in this area than any other country in the European Union . </s>
There have be a reduction in that only two project will be finance whereas in Germany , ten have be plan , nine in the United Kingdom and eight in Italy . </s>
so far , Portugal have have six project finance , on behalf of the municipal authority of Oporto , Gondomar , Lisbon , Odivelas , Oeiras and Amadora . </s>
it be therefore crucial that the Commission review its position , particularly in term of the way in which it allocate project to Portugal , in order to maintain the important task of provide social and economic renewal for urban and suburban area which will guarantee sustainable urban development . </s>
the McCarthy report on the Urban Community Initiative give us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matter . </s>
the situation of certain urban area be alarming , with the social distress take the form of unemployment , misery and crime . </s>
drug dealing in particular fuel insecurity and delinquency . </s>
face with these social challenge , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds be still in doubt . </s>
subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercise its govern function , and local authority be the body most able to intervene appropriately . </s>
the state can ensure public safety and the local authority can help disadvantaged people . </s>
although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchange between successful enterprise , the problem specific to each urban area can be deal with in the same way . </s>
the Urban Community Initiative be help to achieve the European Union 's desire to communitise urban policy . </s>
it would be more appropriate for the Eu to concentrate its financial effort on pre-exist European policy . </s>
clearly some people be profit from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which be particularly mistime when the convergence criterion for EMU be impose a very strict slim regime on the national budget . </s>
Mrs McCarthy be therefore suggest an increase in the fund allocate to Urban and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extol the benefit of a federal Europe . </s>
we should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure be not measure by the volume of funding allocate to the project . </s>
in fact , the beneficiary of too many and too high subsidy will eventually just take these for grant . </s>
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility . </s>
finally , the report specifically highlight action in favour of ethnic or sociological minority . </s>
we can only condemn a policy on minority which be inevitably dangerous for social cohesion . </s>
on one hand , this policy encourage the integration of immigrant where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country . </s>
this would prevent the development of ethnic ghetto which be nothing more than urban powder keg . </s>
on the other hand , it manipulate the principle of positive discrimination . </s>
this be a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful , as show by the US precedent . </s>
for all these reason , the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report . </s>
Decourrière report ( A5-0028 / @card@ ) Mr President , the INTERREG programme be particularly close to our heart . </s>
like many of my colleague , I be please that the European Parliament be able to safeguard this initiative . </s>
as I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium , I be well aware that the region be where Europe be be create . </s>
they be where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive . </s>
these project must therefore be properly take into account and must integrate sustainable development . </s>
why be I stress this point ? </s>
the answer be quite simply because the project currently be submit be still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they be submit . </s>
for example , to accept new road be to accept new pollution within the European Union . </s>
this go totally against the policy which we be propose to fight greenhouse gas emission , for example . </s>
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the Eu 's policy be integrate into the project submit and that the goal of reduce CO2 for example form an experimental added value in the project propose . </s>
I be particularly think in this respect of certain infrastructure which be under construction . </s>
we know that some Member States be still waver , for example , between rail and road for route through vulnerable area such as the Pyrenees , as in the Aspe valley . </s>
however , I be also think of my own region where my government be still debate whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the A32 . </s>
in this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensure that there be real cohesion between the various policy , specifically in the INTERREG programme which be be submit . </s>
Mr President , I vote for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG , mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier give to some member who take the floor and ask for this programme to make great reference to border region with maritime frontier . </s>
I vote for it , not just because I be bear in a coastal town , Genoa , but above all because the frontier of region border by the sea be frontier too . </s>
these frontier stretch as far as African state and the Middle East : we must take great account of the fact that it be also important to develop coastal region in every part of Europe . </s>
as an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest . </s>
we can never talk enough about the difficulty experience in the past by maritime and landlocked border region which have be cut off economically , socially and culturally . </s>
due to the existence of these border , they have become peripheral area within the country to which they belong . </s>
this have too often lead the national authority to neglect these region in national policy . </s>
this be why the INTERREG Community Initiative be launch in @card@ . </s>
this programme be design to encourage cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union . </s>
INTERREG serve principally to fund Community scheme to develop SMEs , education and training , cultural exchange , action to combat health problem , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunication network . </s>
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourage the involvement of local and regional authority in the process of European integration . </s>
more active participation by these authority in Community initiative should be promote , bear in mind that in many case they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal framework and different level of development on either side of the border . </s>
in cross-border cooperation , great emphasis must be place on improve the condition for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertaking which be the job creator . </s>
in the same respect , give that structural unemployment be responsible for @card@ % of all unemployment , the INTERREG fund make available must be sufficient to supplement national measure promote employment . </s>
obstacle too often cause by double taxation and social protection be prevent , brake or hinder cross-border mobility . </s>
I hope that the project include within the programme can help to provide solution to these problem and to implement in practical term the principle of free movement of worker which be in a bad way in my region ! </s>
INTERREG resource must also contribute to the development of a European research area . </s>
finally , and in particular , expectation in the region about this initiative be high give that small town not eligible for Objective 2 funding be hope to obtain compensation through INTERREG ! </s>
the challenge be therefore immense . </s>
the integration of the border region will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy ! </s>
I hope everyone , like Mr Decourrière , whom I congratulate , will realise this ! </s>
- ( FR ) the INTERREG Community Initiative be just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy . </s>
this apparently generous policy , officially intend to help problem region , be a fool 's bargain for French taxpayer . </s>
France contribute @card@ % of the European budget yet will receive only 8 % of the regional structural fund . </s>
between @card@ and @card@ , our region annually receive an average of FF @card@ billion but will receive only FF @card@ billion between @card@ and @card@ . </s>
my region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affect with French Hainaut lose the aid pay to Objective 1 region . </s>
this loss be unjustified in a region whose main activity have be ruin by free-trade Europe . </s>
the European regional policy also reinforce the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authority be invite to negotiate directly on the use of the structural fund . </s>
this be a Europe of region in which the region , which be weak than the nation state , will easily submit to Brussels . </s>
the INTERREG initiative , launch in @card@ to prepare the border region for a Europe without border and therefore without nation , sit comfortably within this philosophy . </s>
however , Mr Decourrière do show some common sense by denounce the failing of the Brussels technocrat . </s>
these failing will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial loss for the region in receipt of aid . </s>
we also agree with the rapporteur about ask for more attention to be pay to small and medium-sized undertaking and , of course , about refuse to use outside service provider . </s>
these be the procedure which cause the corruption scandal in the previous Commission . </s>
however , these isolated element which make sense and for which we vote , in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterise the Community initiative , particularly INTERREG . </s>
this be why the National Front vote against the report . </s>
the European Parliament have deliver an opinion on the Commission guideline for the INTERREG Community Initiative concern cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation . </s>
I want to defend an amendment table by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative . </s>
this do not involve the concern about the future of the Atlantic arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime border into strand a on cross-border cooperation . </s>
in the Commission guideline , few maritime area be eligible for INTERREG IIIA . </s>
the amendment to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented . </s>
this be an important development which must be support as it be the future of the Eu which be at stake . </s>
I be aware of the Commission 's reluctance on this subject as it announce during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November . </s>
however , I must point out that prevent the recognition of maritime border amount to deny the existence of an area which have great potential for project and innovation . </s>
One example of this be the ' Celtic ' area which encompass the territory of Brittany in France , Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland . </s>
this be an area whose locally-based economy be characterise by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector . </s>
it also have excellent cultural and relational link , through twinnings for example . </s>
INTERREG III , strand a , would allow the region in this area to advance a number of structural project need to develop small and medium-sized undertaking and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer . </s>
the European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide link between region . </s>
this policy would have important economic consequence for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catch could be unload at Irish advance base in order to then be transport to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry . </s>
the integration of the maritime border into strand a would finally allow the western periphery to be recognise as a unique and important economic area which be confront by the ' continentalisation ' of the European Union . </s>
this would show respect for these peripheral area which be rather concern about enlargement to the east . </s>
the maritime world have great potential . </s>
we therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programme which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be define . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the European project begin as a partnership between States . </s>
this partnership have ensure peace and stability in our part of Europe for over @card@ year . </s>
as a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the Eu be just one proof , and in view of the ever great proliferation of our Western value , competition on the world market have grow considerably within the last few decade . </s>
the Eu should be prepare to meet that competition . </s>
we can only do that by intensify co-operation within the Community . </s>
it should not be about great integration of the Eu country in the form of a federation but about use our economic potential across national border . </s>
it be about co-operate on joint project and about unify force on all side . </s>
a programme such as INTERREG be there precisely to support regional development project across national border , project which make it possible to build centre of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitor on a global scale . </s>
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) Mr Decourrière 's report be not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in open up border region , it come out in favour of SMEs in paragraph @card@ . </s>
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet , who be well verse in this matter , have table five amendment highlight the role of SMEs and craft trade within the framework of INTERREG , the importance of cooperation between undertaking and the need to involve economic and social partner in the design and implementation of the programme and I welcome the fact that these amendment be adopt unanimously . </s>
Nonetheless , the French delegation in our group be unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have divert the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nation . </s>
we have no intention of give Brussels the job of regulate regional planning in the Member States , as suggest in recital of the report . </s>
we only ask one thing of the Commission : that it confine itself to ensure that the implementation of joint policy do not upset the balance of regional planning in our territory . </s>
the destructive effect of the Cap and EMU on the balance between region , especially on the vitality of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated region , be proof positive of the fact that such ambition be not a sinecure , far from it . </s>
we be therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encourage interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sideline the Member States . </s>
this infatuation with strand IIIC be all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledge in his explanatory statement that ' the draft guideline do not provide any indication of possible field of co-operation ' ( p.17 ) and that ' the responsibility be diffuse and vague ' ( p.18 ) . </s>
call under these circumstance , as he do in paragraph @card@ , for the budget for this strand to be increase be another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbid tactic which be customary in this House . </s>
lastly , there be the desire express both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière 's report of use INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans : I do not think that the structural fund should be use to repair the damage which the Americans inflict on Serbia during bombardment which be as criminal as they be ineffectual . </s>
it be up to Washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which be trigger merely to serve its interest . </s>
the French delegation in our group be therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote . </s>
Procacci report ( A5-0025 / @card@ ) Mr President , I vote for the Procacci report on rural development , not only because I endorse the major policy line of the Leader programme , but also because it complement the Urban programme , which I speak about earlier . </s>
just as elderly people in city be very isolate , so the elderly be fast become the sole inhabitant of rural area because young people be move to the city : they be draw by the bright light , and the pub , and the countryside and rural area be be empty . </s>
I therefore believe that it be very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further develop . </s>
Mr President , my concern at this point be to highlight certain aspect , totally neglect in yesterday 's debate , of the leader + programme which , hopefully , will soon be up and run . </s>
however , first I should like to take this opportunity to express my full support for the focal point of the Commission 's new programme . </s>
that apply in particular to the integrated , multisectoral approach which be gain ground in the agricultural sector and which be highlight time and again by national agricultural minister in the Member States . </s>
and great emphasis on environmental protection in connection with rural area in general be extremely important for the future of all of us . </s>
refer to farmer as the guardian of the countryside well express the preferred direction of future agricultural policy , and , of course , its transposition . </s>
I also take it as a good sign that , thank to one of the most fundamental change to the leader + programme , all rural area and hence @card@ % of the total area of the European Union and @card@ % of the people in the @card@ Member States will be able to benefit from the programme . </s>
however , the total sum for the six-year period have be pitch low , too low , at EUR 2 @card@ million . </s>
in addition , and this be what concern me most , still no provision have be make for initiative gear to mountain area . </s>
Parliament refer in the leader + programme to the sparsely-populated area of northern Europe , but not to the often equally thinly-populated and hence less favour mountain area . </s>
thank you for your attention . </s>
- ( PT ) although this Community initiative , Leader + , follow on from previous initiative , it have some unique feature . </s>
One of these of course be the reduction by around one half in appropriation make available even though they will cover a long period . </s>
nevertheless , new objective have be include , specifically the financing of the Nature Network @card@ , for which all rural region will be eligible . </s>
in spite of the fact that this Community initiative be aim at rural development , it do not address the issue of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this be unacceptable . </s>
without agriculture , the rural world will disappear . </s>
this mean that any strategy for rural development must be base on agriculture 's internal potential while at the same time develop as many other activity as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world . </s>
this be why we consider it essential to improve the report by mean of our proposal deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmer in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriation in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural region which be cover before . </s>
we also want to ensure that the new programme continue to prioritise the less-favoured region . </s>
our position on Leader be a product of our more general assessment of the Eu 's overall agricultural policy . </s>
both Leader 1 and Leader 2 , which be implement in the 1990s , be ingredient of the new cap that emerge after its review in @card@ and , along with other respective measure , they constitute the so-termed second pillar of the Eu 's rural development policy . </s>
their real aim be to moderate and disguise the new cap 's disastrous consequence and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmer , and not to develop the rural area or retain the agricultural population therein as be hypocritically declare in their objective . </s>
this be prove by the fact that in the area where those initiative be implement , farm income and employment decrease rapidly , which result in their depopulation . </s>
a characteristic example be Greece , which as an Objective 1 country be include as a whole in the Leader Community initiative , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reach approximately @card@ % , while between @card@ and @card@ farming income decrease by @card@ % . </s>
we think Leader + will be even more ineffectual than Leader 1 and Leader 2 , for the follow reason . </s>
the real aim of Leader + be the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2 , in other word to moderate and disguise the negative consequence of the cap to be implement in the context of Agenda @card@ and the WTO . </s>
the present cap , however , be bad than its predecessor and it also start from a bad basis , grant that the @card@ cap review and the GATT agreement in @card@ have create serious problem and impasse for the agricultural economy . </s>
the selection criterion and the activity that be subsidise under Leader do , in the good case , moderate some partial problem of the countryside , which be of secondary importance , but in the bad case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relation and pander to conscience . </s>
in no case , however , be they programme for the integrated development of the select area and they do not create permanent job in the countryside because most of the activity there be not productive in nature . </s>
the actual appropriation available for Leader + compare with Leader 2 be small despite their increase by @card@ % ( from EUR 1 @card@ million for Leader 2 to EUR 2 @card@ million for Leader + ) . </s>
this be because the @card@ % increase be nominal and not real , grant that average yearly inflation in the Community during those year be approximately 2 % . </s>
leader + will last a year longer than Leader 2 . </s>
leader + can cover all the region of the Eu , while Leader 2 cover only the objective 1 region and some Objective 5b and 6 region . </s>
we must point out , however , that even if the actual appropriation available for Leader + be increase , the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programme can compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the cap that will be implement in the context of ' Agenda @card@ ' and the WTO . </s>
the real outcome of such programme be to act as a cover-up , to lead people off the scent and to salve conscience . </s>
we disagree with many of the report 's view . </s>
once more , we point to the negative change of the cap ( @card@ - Agenda @card@ ) . </s>
we do not think Leader + will contribute substantively towards solve the countryside 's problem , which be characterise by the decline of farming , which be and should remain the countryside 's basic social and economic branch . </s>
for our part , we will tell the farmer about the expediency of these programme . </s>
we will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from be waste , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmer against the disastrous cap which be disinherit them and lead them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside . </s>
unless this cap be overthrow , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmer and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside . </s>
All the member in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group vote in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the leader + Community Initiative . </s>
however , we amend the draft report adopt by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain point which will make this Community initiative more effective . </s>
in particular we feel it be necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedure which prove to be too cumbersome and slow in the Leader II initiative . </s>
it be also essential to ensure that good account be take of the development priority of local operator and that the benefit of Leader + fund be not limit solely to agricultural region with a low population density . </s>
Amendment No @card@ which I table on behalf of my group refer to the concept of ' economic and social cohesion ' rather than ' regional development ' as the European Union do not have any recognise competence in this area . </s>
amendment no @card@ replace ' government or municipal official ' with ' government official ' . </s>
although local action group should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partner draw from the different socio-economic sector of the territory concern , government official must be involve at decision-making level , whether they come from the municipality , department , region or national government . </s>
the rapporteur 's phrasing be therefore too limit . </s>
amendment no @card@ respond to the expectation of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of this House . </s>
it specify the necessary coordination between Leader + and Community cooperation and partnership programme such as INTERREG , Phare , Sapard or Meda . </s>
in the territory of Member States of the European Union , applicant country or Member States of EFTA , there may be interrelation between the various Community initiative . </s>
the real priority for the European continent be to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as propose by the rapporteur . </s>
the creation of organisation similar to the LAGs may be usefully encourage by the European Union , provide that the corresponding cost be bear by the various partner . </s>
in essence , we be , of course , in favour of this leader + Community Initiative . </s>
the conference on rural development hold in Cork from 7 to 9 November @card@ set rural development as one of the European Union 's priority since it be essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , include infrastructure , public and private service and so on . </s>
in this context , in committee we regret the paltry funding allot to rural development and support the amendment call for an increase budget for this Community initiative so that it match the previous Leader I and Leader II initiative . </s>
the budget allocate to Leader + for a period of seven year be half that allocate to Leader II for a period of six year . </s>
this be unacceptable give the importance of rural development and the consequence for farmer of the fall in price and aid specify in the reform of the cap follow the Berlin agreement . </s>
finally , among the priority parameter to be introduce at European level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be pay to the quality and originality of project which have already be implement by LAGs within the Leader II initiative , but which could not be conclude due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanism specify . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at 3 p. m. ) additive in feedingstuffs the next item be the report ( A5-0015 / @card@ ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amend Directive @card@ / @card@ / EEC concern additive in feedingstuffs ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0134 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , under Directive @card@ / @card@ , high-technology additive be treat differently , depend on the date of authorisation . </s>
the Commission have propose harmonise the authorisation procedure so that substance license before @card@ be put on an equal footing with substance authorise now . </s>
as far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development be concern , so far so good . </s>
however , the directive also encompass the authorisation of antibiotic , drug , growth-promoters and genetically-modified organism . </s>
that make it a question of health , not just approximate law , which be why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article @card@ - be not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article @card@ , that be to say with codecision by Parliament . </s>
we ask the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which point out that , as far as approximate law be concern , Article @card@ be adequate in this case . </s>
however , we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confine ourselves to approximate law ; because this proposal also encompass genetically-modified organism , we have table a further propose amendment which affect the content and hence public health . </s>
we negotiate with the Commission for two year on the seed directive and come to a compromise regulate the release of genetically-modified organism in the directive , take the text on which Directive @card@ / @card@ be base as a start point . </s>
Mr Byrne , we fail to understand why the Commission be not approximate the text on genetically-modified organism as part of its harmonisation work . </s>
we have now table a propose amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text . </s>
moreover , this text have also be adopt in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently need to be adopt in this directive as well . </s>
the Commission point out in committee that it plan to present a novel feed directive in the future . </s>
however , that should not prevent us from harmonise the text in order to ensure that there be no legal uncertainty between the various directive . </s>
we be therefore assume that you will accept our propose amendment with regard to genetically-modified organism . </s>
directive @card@ / @card@ still contain the old text because the seed directive be submit to Parliament in @card@ and we then negotiate with the Commission until @card@ , while the report on this directive be deal with in @card@ and Parliament obviously do not accord genetically-modified organism the same importance then as it do later when I be rapporteur . </s>
we therefore assume , Commissioner Byrne , that you too will accept our propose amendment of the legal base . </s>
if you do not , we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you , exactly as we do with the seed directive . </s>
I should point out that the text which we have now work out be a valid compromise , both for your legal service and ours . </s>
in other word , we do not need to re-negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive . </s>
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposal . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , do regulate additive in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ? </s>
as far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee be concern , it come under competition . </s>
of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonise provision for substance authorise before and after @card@ . </s>
we want to prevent the price of feedingstuffs from rise and Mr Doyle 's propose Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support . </s>
however , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf have say in his report , this be first and foremost a consumer policy matter . </s>
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussion . </s>
when we talk of transparency in the food chain , that apply from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically start with feedingstuffs . </s>
the antibiotic , growth promoter and genetically-modified organism mix in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain . </s>
the dioxin scandal bring home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulate additive in feedingstuffs be a step in the right direction . </s>
accord to Article @card@ of the EC Treaty , we be oblige to obviate source of danger to human health , whereby the accent be clearly on source . </s>
consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i. e. harmful additive in feedingstuffs . </s>
otherwise , in my view , we be beaver away at the symptom , but not the cause . </s>
people be especially wary of GMOs . </s>
we must confront increase public awareness of GMOs by regulate their use in feedingstuffs accordingly . </s>
first , if an additive consist of or contain genetically-modified organism , then it should only be authorise if it pose no risk to human health or the environment . </s>
secondly , it make sense to issue provision for genetically-modified feedingstuff additive similar to the regulation in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur have say . </s>
and thirdly , if we be to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs . </s>
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party use the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer . </s>
responsible citizen should , in my view , have a choice . </s>
we all talk of scandalise citizen who have lose confidence in food safety . </s>
by regulate additive in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence . </s>
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our propose amendment . </s>
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be . </s>
Mr President , this proposal to amend the @card@ directive on additive in feedingstuffs be the first in a whole series of proposal on the subject of feedingstuffs . </s>
in other word , we shall be discuss other proposal here in Parliament over the next few month . </s>
that this subject be of paramount importance be bear out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , antibiotic , sludge and other scandal have attract . </s>
in other word , this be an important facet of public health protection , which be why we believe that Article @card@ should be take as the legal base , not Article @card@ , as propose by the Commission . </s>
the amendment which the Commission have propose , namely equal treatment for additive authorise before or after @card@ December @card@ , be uncontested and have our full support . </s>
however , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have vote unanimously on some important amendment to the Commission proposal . </s>
the regulation propose by the Commission conceal the danger of create a marketing monopoly for certain additive . </s>
only company which obtain the original authorisation will have the right to apply and company which obtain authorisation at a late date will be exclude . </s>
this sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs , should be prevent by grant provisional authorisation to all company which have market a specific substance by 1 April @card@ . </s>
this would then apply until the re-assessment procedure have be complete . </s>
the most important amendment to the Commission proposal be the inclusion , as recommend by the rapporteur , of genetically-modified organism in the directive on additive , take the compromise negotiate between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the start point . </s>
this already give us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs . </s>
it be therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modify feedingstuff additive in this case , just as we have in regulation already pass in other area , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example . </s>
the label of genetically-modified additive be particularly important in this respect . </s>
on the one hand , it enable farmer to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and , on the other hand , it enable consumer to avoid foodstuff produce use GMOs . </s>
finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who have go to a great deal of trouble . </s>
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne 's reply . </s>
Mr President , the report deal mainly with formality , in other word , the manner in which additive will be authorise . </s>
it be less concern with the type of additive and how they work . </s>
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it be that , in future , all the directive be deal with under Article @card@ , since both food safety and environmental issue require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview . </s>
we can carry on as we have do up until now , that be to say deal with each detail on its own , often only after the harm have already be do . </s>
the rapporteur place the emphasis on the testing and label of GMOs in feed additive . </s>
however , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotic . </s>
certainly , five of the nine antibiotic that be originally permit in animal feed have now be ban . </s>
it be nevertheless extremely important to ban the remain four , both in the interest of human health and for the sake of the animal themselves . </s>
we now know that resistance to antibiotic pose a very serious threat to people 's health , particularly in the case of small child . </s>
a number of Member States be already able to show conclusively that improper practice in connection with the keep of livestock be totally unnecessary . </s>
several country phase out antibiotic in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and other be in the process of successfully do the same . </s>
we talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotic , it have long since be forget . </s>
however , there be another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle . </s>
I should like to say a few word about coccidiostats . </s>
they be a zootechnical product which be not totally necessary . </s>
There be a substitute , which be use to vaccinate chicken . </s>
although it be a little more expensive , it do not harm the environment . </s>
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that be spread on the field . </s>
in that way , they end up in our water supply which , as we all know , be our most vital resource . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the report on additive in animal feedingstuffs concern the technical and economic problem of restore the competitive balance between different additive in feedingstuffs and between producer of these additive . </s>
yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affect Belgium and other European country last summer we can just view this issue in term of competition . </s>
you may recall , even though this pass virtually unnoticed by the general public , that the Commission 's scientific expert discover industrial residue of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit import from Brazil . </s>
we must therefore closely examine all the element of the chain involve in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animal . </s>
incidentally , it be ironic that the problem be much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dog , cat and other domestic animal . </s>
be it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialist have allow this sector to become a way of recycle all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry ? </s>
such a serious issue can be limit to a technical debate , even though it be the directive itself which limit the authorisation of antibiotic and other growth promoter . </s>
the precaution which we be prepare to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be apply to the food for the very farm animal which reach our plate . </s>
as forcefully underline by this report , label be an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding be aware of all the ingredient in the feed which he be give his livestock . </s>
he must also know whether his bag of protein granule include GMOs as these component could represent a risk to public health . </s>
in any case , the precautionary principle require these product to be clearly traceable at all stage of their marketing . </s>
however , before label we need clear rule . </s>
straight question must be ask about the real end-use of animal meal , for example . </s>
although we be look at all the problem cause by these product in ethical and health term , it be their use which must be question today . </s>
in this respect , the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deal with feedingstuffs must serve as a work basis for go beyond mere commercial question . </s>
the Commission have on many occasion use the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group have just underline . </s>
this be a good idea but it must be make to be meaningful and , to do this , the problem link to animal and those link to consumer health must be deal with at the same time . </s>
this be why it be essential to approve Amendment no 2 to Recital 4 which avoid the risk of the monopoly which would arise if company which be the first to be authorise to place an additive on the market be to remain the only one able to continue market it during the re-evaluation procedure . </s>
also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approve as these will ensure that genetically modify additive be clearly identify as such , thus allow user to make fully inform decision . </s>
Mr President , because of the availability of high-technology additive in the feedingstuffs industry , detailed information on their use be need from the actor , and as we know there be a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practice which infringe Community law . </s>
this directive on additive in feedingstuffs can achieve this on its own . </s>
other directive will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture be well place to deal with them . </s>
up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other product be sell over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additive be structure , mix , blend , cut and transport several time . </s>
the fight by feedingstuff manufacturer to gain maximum market share cause a lot of problem , just as it do in the foodstuff industry . </s>
the negative consequence be well know , the positive one less so . </s>
I be firmly convince that the most sensible way of protect the health of European citizen in the ecological chain be through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region . </s>
however , more work be need on this . </s>
Mr President , may I commence by congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on his report . </s>
it reflect the view and concern of all Eu citizen in the area of food safety and quality . </s>
the event of the past couple of year have certainly create an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health . </s>
the swift action take by this Parliament must be see by all citizen as their great guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform . </s>
but even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflect its commitment to subsidiarity by encourage Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility . </s>
in Agenda @card@ , we have in my view prioritised policy that be of direct concern to citizen : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development . </s>
if we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early year of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policy that be people-focused and very much reflect community need . </s>
I welcome in particular the propose new and strict authorisation procedure for additive in animal feed . </s>
those find in breach of them must be deal with severely . </s>
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne . </s>
he have an onerous undertaking but he have respond quickly and effectively to the requirement of this House , as well as to the concern of consumer . </s>
I be particularly please that my own country , Ireland , be to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulation base on the principle of traceability . </s>
this will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . </s>
I be particularly please about the unanimity show on this issue within the group . </s>
it be therefore specify that , through the adoption of a regulation , the Commission will replace the exist authorisations with authorisations link to the person responsible for put the additive into circulation . </s>
this will occur at the same time for all the additive in question . </s>
a coherent legal framework must be re-establish . </s>
as of October @card@ the Commission propose introduce a legal basis into Directive @card@ / @card@ / EEC for the replacement of the authorisations . </s>
however , we must ensure that competition distortion be not create , as highlight by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi . </s>
genetically modify additive must also be clearly identify in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO component or base on GMO component and to guarantee this . </s>
the consumer must remain free to make a fully inform decision . </s>
this proposal have no financial consequence for the Community budget . </s>
There must therefore be total transparency for producer and consumer in the area of food safety . </s>
I be sure that the Commission can accept the report which , as you know , be approve unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . </s>
Mr President , we have say in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs be one of the first and most important factor in safe food production and in consumer health and protection . </s>
we therefore welcome the Commission 's proposal on additive in feedingstuffs . </s>
the Committee on behalf of which I be speak , namely the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , decide in December , on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion . </s>
nevertheless , I should like to say a few word on the report and express a view on a number of point . </s>
first , perhaps , I should say something on the question of the legal base . </s>
even if we have new rule of Procedure in Parliament , and it may well be that , with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture , problem of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment , one thing be always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict : cohesion in this Parliament be crucial and the legal basis of a question be crucial as far as I be concern . </s>
therefore , and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne , I reject your choice of legal basis . </s>
if it be merely a hand-me-down legal basis take over from previous directive , then it be a mistake to keep it . </s>
the Treaty of Amsterdam state quite clearly that , where people 's health be concern , Article @card@ be the correct legal base , and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it be simply not good enough to look at the Commission 's proposal and say , there be nothing in it about health and consumer protection , so it have nothing to do with health and consumer protection . </s>
my group , as Mr Kindermann have already say , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other group in this House will do likewise . </s>
Mr Byrne , I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation . </s>
if we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee , we shall be open the floodgate to manipulation . </s>
the Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by exclude any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article @card@ . </s>
allow me to comment briefly on two other point . </s>
first , genetically modify micro-organism in feedingstuffs . </s>
we can just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law . </s>
we do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organism as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be label . </s>
the rapporteur have do just that and that be a good sign . </s>
I say now , as I have say on numerous occasion in the past : yes , I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House , but we do at least need a start point for a positive list of additive in feedingstuffs . </s>
it be equally important to have strict hygiene requirement for the manufacture of additive and for proper control to be carry out in the Member States . </s>
There be serious shortcoming in both area and we have a great deal of work to do yet . </s>
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report . </s>
this be an issue that we will no doubt be reconsider on a number of occasion in the future . </s>
What have happen in recent year have bring to our attention the tremendous problem face not only to the producer of food but also the consumer . </s>
we must strike a balance between them . </s>
we must resolve this issue , because it be important that consumer should regain confidence in the food they eat . </s>
One way to achieve this be to have total transparency as far as food label be concern . </s>
GMOs be the new challenge face us . </s>
this be something that people be very worry about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concern . </s>
but I think we should not allow our concern about GMOs to overshadow our concern about growth promoter use in animal feed or antibiotic use in compound feed . </s>
indeed , we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal be still include in animal feed in many country in Europe . </s>
One factor behind these development that have be refer to in this debate be competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food . </s>
these be all area in which we have to ensure a level play field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States . </s>
we have have the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problem . </s>
the main problem be a financial one , namely who bear the cost ? </s>
the problem be that the cost be not share equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer have be force to bear all the cost . </s>
we need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that have be incur . </s>
we must also ensure that the food that be import into the European Union meet the standard within the European Union . </s>
if we do not maintain those standard for import food then we be go to encounter great difficulty in the future . </s>
. </s>
I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for examine the Commission 's proposal . </s>
the Commission proposal be , as some of you have say , rather technical . </s>
Nonetheless it have a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedure govern the authorisation of feed additive . </s>
at present there be a difference in treatment between authorisations , depend on whether application be submit before or after 1 January @card@ . </s>
the purpose of the Commission 's proposal be to harmonise procedure to ensure that no such difference exist . </s>
the scope of the propose amendment be therefore very limit . </s>
Five amendment have be present by Parliament . </s>
I regret that the Commission be not in a position to accept these amendment , despite the fact that I be fully aware of the view and commitment of Parliament , the Agricultural Committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on these issue . </s>
I shall deal with each of the individual amendment separately . </s>
the first amendment propose to change the legal base of the proposal by replace Article @card@ with Article @card@ . </s>
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal make no reference to health or consumer protection . </s>
the propose amendment be technical and can be interpret as have as its primary objective the protection of public health . </s>
I note that Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accept that Article @card@ be the appropriate legal base . </s>
I remind Parliament that in Article @card@ the primary objective be the protection of health . </s>
I commend to you the argument set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which set out the position , in my view , with precision , clarity and commendable brevity . </s>
amendment Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provision on genetically modify additive . </s>
I be the first to accept that GMOs be a very important issue . </s>
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiative to update Eu legislation in the field of GMOs be necessary . </s>
however , this technical amendment be not the correct instrument to introduce such initiative . </s>
the Commission be of the view that it be premature to amend the rule currently lay down by Directive @card@ / @card@ on genetically modify additive at this stage . </s>
instead it be appropriate to await development in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive @card@ / @card@ , which be currently in second reading in Parliament . </s>
the Commission envisage go much further than be currently propose by Parliament in its amendment . </s>
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provision of Directive @card@ / @card@ be include in the proposal for a recast of Directive @card@ / @card@ that the Commission have propose in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July @card@ . </s>
I can also assure Parliament that all observation make here today will be fully take into account . </s>
amendment Nos 4 and 5 be also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy product by grant them authorisation to be place into circulation even before an application for authorisation have be submit . </s>
the Commission insist on first evaluate such application as to their safety and efficacy before give authorisations . </s>
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additive in feedingstuffs to address wide issue . </s>
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issue that be raise during the debate . </s>
first of all , regard the observation make by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additive in the Additives Directive @card@ / @card@ , and not in the Novel Feed Directive . </s>
this be a directive that deal more specifically with raw material rather than with additive . </s>
the text take by Parliament be from the directive which be adopt in @card@ . </s>
but the vertical legislation in Directive @card@ / @card@ on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs have change since then and be still change . </s>
it be before Parliament for second reading . </s>
it be my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive @card@ / @card@ and in particular , Article @card@ . </s>
reference be also make to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopoly . </s>
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi make reference to this . </s>
There be just a few point I should like to make on that issue . </s>
first of all , this matter have be in the pipeline since @card@ , so it have not really be spring on any other commodity producer . </s>
indeed any such applicant can still apply in respect of their particular product . </s>
I should also stress that the Commission have never approve any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be include in additive . </s>
Mrs Roth-Behrendt make reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be Article @card@ or Article @card@ . </s>
I again refer to what I say earlier in relation to this and assure her and the house that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure base on Article @card@ merely by exclude from the provision any reference to public health . </s>
this be an issue that have be look at on at least two separate occasion by the European Court of Justice , which have lay down the legal criterion for situation such as this where the appropriate legal base have to be properly take into account when put forward legislation . </s>
the jurisprudence of the Court appear to be quite clear in relation to this . </s>
as an overall comment to the suggest amendment here , particularly in relation to the legal base issue , it would be inappropriate , in my opinion , to change the legal base to Article @card@ in these circumstance , as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criterion that have be lay down by the Court . </s>
a number of you make reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surround label . </s>
directive @card@ / @card@ foresee the issue of label in the genetic modification of additive . </s>
it be already include now : &quot; indication of the particular characteristic due to the manufacturing product &quot; . </s>
so this issue will be address . </s>
that formula enable us to oblige applicant to put on the label the fact that genetic modification technique have be use in the product , the subject matter of the application . </s>
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question . </s>
first allow me to point out , Commissioner Byrne , that the European Parliament have no right of legislative initiative . </s>
but we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have single out . </s>
Nonetheless , we have confine ourselves in our propose amendment to bring the text into line with that of other directive and we have disregard the question of content . </s>
for example , you do not go into antibiotic . </s>
we be therefore talk about harmonise the legal provision in the individual directive . </s>
my question , Commissioner Byrne be this : the UN conference in Montreal decide that genetically-modified organism must be label for international trade . </s>
do you really believe that , if we could , Parliament would permit label to be leave off feedingstuff additive within the European Union ? </s>
Commissioner Byrne , it appear that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament . </s>
we negotiate the seed marketing legislation for two year . </s>
I look forward to the next round . </s>
. </s>
I would stress that no GMOs have be approve under this directive ; it apply only to additive . </s>
I would also say in relation to the question surround label that this be a complex issue . </s>
it be be address and will be address in a comprehensive way , particularly in Directive @card@ / @card@ . </s>
this issue be before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directive deal it , which will also come under the legal base of Article @card@ which give Parliament full competence in the area of codecision . </s>
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it be by no mean my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue . </s>
it be my intention , as it have always be , to work in cooperation with Parliament , to ensure that the result we achieve be the very good result . </s>
the good way of deal with this issue be through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstance where the question that be set out and to be debate in Directive @card@ / @card@ may not be fully take into account . </s>
it be well to wait for that debate which , I understand , will take place fairly soon . </s>
all of these matter will be address in that legislation . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
Parliament have take due note of your comment . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ a. M. Scrapie the next item be the report ( A5-0023 / @card@ ) by Mr Böge , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend Council Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC as regard scrapie ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0026 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , it be and always will be one of life 's mystery , one of the unsolved riddle of the follow-up to the BSE crisis , that we still have no Community rule for the control of scrapie in sheep . </s>
in this respect , the Commission 's proposal to amend directive @card@ / @card@ and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of Tse infection in general , comply with Parliament 's demand in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this . </s>
I should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge be need which prove that the experimental infection of sheep by feed them BSE-infected feed produce a clinical expression of the disease which be indistinguishable from the symptom of scrapie . </s>
no new knowledge be need , because the theory from the beginning be that Bse and scrapie must be relate and this theory have increasingly take hold . </s>
from this point of view we be slightly behind the time . </s>
I be therefore in complete agreement with the Commission 's proposal on scrapie . </s>
I should , however , like to add that it only make sense if we ensure that the new Tse regulation allow a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestion . </s>
we therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven point in the come debate on the Tse proposal , and that of course include scrapie . </s>
when we discuss the Tse regulation , Commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposal under Article @card@ as the corresponding legal base for product exclude from this regulation , such as cosmetic , medicinal product or animal feed . </s>
we insist on this . </s>
as far as I be concern , that mean that fundamental core provision in this propose regulation must not be relegate yet again to the Annex but include in the body of the propose regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here . </s>
it also mean that , when we be fight these disease , the problem of destroy whole herd in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or Bse and the question of define geographical area be item which also remain on the agenda . </s>
although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie be include in the Tse regulation , I feel that the Commission 's proposal for fight scrapie be still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendment on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposal when the Roth-Behrendt report be debate . </s>
I should also like to address two other point . </s>
we expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regard outbreak of scrapie or TSEs . </s>
here again the Commission be increase its response to the work carry out by and the demand make by Parliament . </s>
finally , in discuss the question of the future application of test , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reach the point where test be generally applicable . </s>
but the test available now be perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal . </s>
but when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a good category , an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoir use such test can provide useful pointer in the political and scientific debate as to where there be a need for preventive consumer protection and , basically , where such test can be use to help us settle dispute on a proper basis . </s>
I would be grateful , Commissioner , if you would take these pass comment on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be call you to account on these point . </s>
Mr President , over the year , the follow situation have arise : one subject have develop into a subject of many facet . </s>
Many of us here in this House have spend year , whether we intend to or not , deal solely with the consequence of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail . </s>
and it be still on the agenda today . </s>
it be therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge be talk about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf have just mention it in his report . </s>
the cast be always the same . </s>
although the cause be unfortunate , it be certainly not the bad experience of this Parliament . </s>
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee be a very simple one . </s>
I agree with the rapporteur and be able to say that the Environment Committee have ask the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal . </s>
that save a great deal of time which I would like to use for other thing and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as Mr Böge have just do . </s>
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House . </s>
at first we be somewhat irresolute and we regret that now . </s>
but I have come to the conclusion that it be in fact quite clever timing . </s>
this debate do in fact give us an excellent opportunity , Mr Byrne , to give the Commission a few thing to think about . </s>
although we do not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , thing may be different with this report . </s>
allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge deal with - and this form of collaboration between two committee , with one lead committee and the other give an opinion and vice versa , work very well and could perhaps be use as a model for the future - be relatively simple . </s>
it will become more difficult once we see the Tse proposal , Mr Byrne . </s>
when we have the chance to ask direct question , the question which Mr Böge refer to will be ask . </s>
question will be ask - question which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representative in committee - on how thing stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third country . </s>
How will BSE status in fact be define then ? </s>
do you envisage circumstance under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test ? </s>
and then there be my standing question to you Mr Byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you . </s>
What about the BSE test ? </s>
when will you make it compulsory ? </s>
perhaps you will do so before Parliament debate the Tse report . </s>
not that I want to put it off , but it would be a gesture , as it be , if you could say : here be the propose legislation on the BSE test . </s>
I know that I be a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that be my job . </s>
I say quite emphatically , even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , who be completely involve in the whole idea , that animal feeding , animal rearing , animal production must be suit to the specie and must also , above all , cause no harm or danger to human being . </s>
cosmetic , medical and other product can be exclude on the ground that they cause no harm or be not dangerous . </s>
that be , without doubt , too short , too sweet and too little . </s>
you be lucky that Mr Böge 's report only deal with this on the sideline ; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble do so . </s>
finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne . </s>
we have a new Commission . </s>
whether or not we will agree with the work carry out by this Commission and the President of the Commission , only time will tell . </s>
but there be one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I be sure that , as a lawyer and politician you will understand this . </s>
important issue can be regulate in annexe . </s>
they belong in the legislative text . </s>
I might do the same if I be a Commissioner , because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament , which take so long and be so difficult . </s>
but you must understand that we can let you get away with this . </s>
in other word , whenever I get the chance , I shall take everything out of the annexe and cram it into the legislative text . </s>
and you would be well advise to do likewise from the outset . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it be for this chain to provide us with safe , healthy food which be produce , as a matter of principle , without any questionable or risky interim or end product . </s>
over recent year , these basic principle have often be neglect in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matter because of shoddy practice or greed . </s>
the European Parliament have already take a clear stand on Bse and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemic in animal . </s>
we should not allow food safety to be compromise because , in the final analysis , it be our health which be at stake . </s>
the Commission 's proposal encompass both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goat and a Community regulation to fight scrapie . </s>
this be even more important give that there be no clear proof that Bse and scrapie be unrelated . </s>
animal be buy throughout Europe and transport over the entire continent . </s>
the spread of an epidemic as the result of bring in one sick animal can have huge consequence for farmer . </s>
and I should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie be detect in Austria about four week ago . </s>
Scrapie be a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for year and be then ingest in food . </s>
the disease be always fatal . </s>
as there be no vaccination , farmer can only protect themselves by not buy animal from country in which there be case of scrapie . </s>
even if scrapie can be pass on to human being , the connection with Bse have still not be clarify , as I have already say . </s>
as a farmer myself , I be most concern that consumer health should not be put at risk . </s>
I be in favour of preventive measure , start with feeding which be suitable for the species , rather than measure to combat an epidemic once it have break out . </s>
I therefore welcome the Commission 's initiative to create a new legal base for combat scrapie . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Böge 's report on measure to prevent Tse disease be base on the proposal of the European Parliament 's temporary Bse Committee . </s>
Mr Böge be responsible for some invaluable work on this committee , and it be a relief to see that the job of monitor the work of the Bse Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have fall to him : he be the one with the experience . </s>
I would have like my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treat the second part of the Commission 's proposal . </s>
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's report from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy be feature in the plenary session . </s>
in the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber say that scrapies be an insidious disease . </s>
it be indeed . </s>
for me as a Finn , and a member who have be active in matter concern agriculture and the health and transportation of animal , it be most important that those Eu state where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guarantee the right to inspect as fully as be necessary the transportation of live animal . </s>
I wish to stress how important it be for us to remain free of disease . </s>
the possibility , if necessary , of have additional inspection of animal in these area be not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really be justification for it . </s>
the inspection must be see as be fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animal and prevent increase expenditure for the Eu . </s>
on behalf of the European liberal democrat , we can support the Commission 's proposal on Mr Böge 's report , but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's report we must look again at the position of those country where TSEs do not occur . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur . </s>
There be no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment be now tremendous expert in this field . </s>
it be very good that they be continue to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it be extremely important . </s>
regardless of the many other concern we may have , Bse have give us a terrible legacy that have to be deal with and resolve . </s>
it be quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep have be a contribute factor to the overall problem . </s>
I welcome the legal base be set and the comprehensive way the new rule will , I hope , address this situation . </s>
we must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experience in the past to happen again in the future . </s>
no-one would want to see what happen to farmer with Bse happen ever again . </s>
we have to bring in the most stringent rule and we have to make them work . </s>
it be extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it be by rigorously tackle the problem and resolve it . </s>
Bse have certainly not go away . </s>
you can see it in different country . </s>
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many country be now face similar problem to those we have have in the United Kingdom . </s>
it will be there for some time to come . </s>
we have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of follow the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , be part of that confidence-building mechanism . </s>
if we be not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future . </s>
finally , I have certainly believe for a long time , come from an agricultural background myself , that if we have feed the animal the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs have be make up of the proper compound we would never have have BSE in the first place . </s>
it be never the responsibility of the farmer , it be the food compounder who cause this problem and we have to ensure that it never happen again . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , I be please to have be give this opportunity to discuss a subject where there be good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , namely combat TSEs . </s>
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue . </s>
considerable progress have be make on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article @card@ of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs . </s>
this proposal address all Tse risk in all animal at all stage of the production chain . </s>
I be here today to listen to your opinion on the first step in this process of establish a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these disease . </s>
I have propose in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rule on scrapie in sheep and goat and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation . </s>
the detailed rule would then follow in that framework proposal . </s>
I have be inform that you welcome this initiative , as appear from your contribution this afternoon , to formulate a single text . </s>
I be look forward to discuss any further improvement you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference make by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue . </s>
I look forward to receipt of that document , which will be take into account in all further consideration in relation to this issue . </s>
finally , I would say this in relation to the observation about include legislation in annexe and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament have a full say and yet at the same time our have speedy resolution , speedy legislation and speedy amendment to existing legislation . </s>
in the month I have be Commissioner and observe the way legislation go through the system , I can see that much work need to be do on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that be , the translation of policy into legislation . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ a. m. Community policy in the field of water the next item be the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0027 / @card@ ) on the common position adopt by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establish a framework for Community action in the field of water policy ( @card@ / 3 / @card@ - C5-0209 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann ) . </s>
- ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , lady and gentleman , water will be one of the main environmental and world issue of the twenty-first century . </s>
climate change , global resource , river quality and groundwater aquifer quality be major challenge which threaten our common future . </s>
we will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet 's ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse event which will threaten the development of certain region , the live condition of the inhabitant of other region and even , more fundamentally , the global balance . </s>
To support this statement , I would point to an excellent report draft by our colleague , Mário Soares , in the international body on the state of the sea and ocean . </s>
when talk about climate change , we have rightly refer to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere . </s>
yet we also know that the deterioration of the ocean will significantly destabilise whole area of our planet . </s>
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it be itself face serious problem of pollution and deterioration of its water , include its groundwater , surface water and sea . </s>
furthermore , Europe have sign international convention , in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it make certain commitment . </s>
in this it say that in a few year ' time we must have stop dump pollution and halt the increase of pollution and we must have reach a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substance . </s>
despite have sign these international agreement , this directive and the specific policy in the field reveal that Europe can achieve the objective set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international convention be threaten . </s>
this be why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy , the European Parliament have since the first reading demand coherence between the framework directive and the international objective , particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR . </s>
this convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action . </s>
the European Union 's water policy be not start from zero . </s>
Many directive have already be adopt . </s>
furthermore , the Commission want to make these directive more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clear objective . </s>
the preparation of this framework directive be therefore prompt by a desire for rationalisation . </s>
however , at first read this House insist that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitment make , like OSPAR , but should allow us to reverse the course of affair . </s>
for despite these directive and frequent declaration about the effort which must be make in term of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objective have not be achieve . </s>
in many case the situation have deteriorate and we therefore can settle for just rationalisation of the text . </s>
we must set objective which be equal to the challenge face us . </s>
yet we do not have much time . </s>
we could , as the Commission have propose , accept these overlong deadline which the Commission and the Council have extend even further . </s>
yet if we do , we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public , but these effort will be postpone until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be defer again . </s>
it be clear that in this event the objective will never be achieve . </s>
I be stress this point because , when disaster be be report daily in the news , we can just keep on say for the umpteenth time that Europe do not act when it should have do . </s>
then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problem which we refuse to tackle properly at the appropriate time . </s>
the current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania show very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development , clear requirement , control and precise measure concern the state of our river , this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time . </s>
it be also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner . </s>
even now , the river in Brittany be eutrophying and this be damaging tourism . </s>
To conclude , the issue be clear at this second reading . </s>
do we or do we not want standard compatible with OSPAR , in other word to get dangerous substance down to zero ? </s>
do we want to shorten the deadline propose by the Council for this directive ? </s>
do we want to have a pricing policy which enable all public and private participant to clean up and save water ? </s>
do we seriously want to respond to the hope of our people ? </s>
the majority of the amendment approve by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objective . </s>
I hope they will be support by this House . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , Mrs Lienemann have just paint a very drastic picture of how important water and air be to us , especially as the very source of life for human being . </s>
the problem be one of both water quality and water resource , of which there be not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe , especially in very dry region . </s>
I be sorry that Commissioner Wallström , who be responsible in this area , can be here now because this be , after all , a very , very important directive on which the Commission have be work for a long time , and water protection legislation , which we be debate now at second reading , affect all the citizen of the European Union as well as all the people in country wish to join , who will have to comply with Eu legislation once they accede . </s>
we have be work on this subject for ten year and a comprehensive approach be only make possible as the result of a hearing arrange and hold by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in @card@ . </s>
a great deal of work have be carry out between then and this second reading by numerous member of the European Parliament , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers . </s>
we reduce the @card@ propose amendment in the Environment Committee to @card@ , but another @card@ have be add . </s>
you see , there be numerous matter of concern here and they be all very different . </s>
some want tight legislation , some want more clarification , other want to serve national interest . </s>
even within my group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European democrat , there be , of course , difference of opinion . </s>
our line be to work towards realistic objective and practicable solution . </s>
in this sense , the propose amendment table by me and other member on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demand set out in the common position . </s>
some propose amendment which we support should strengthen the European Parliament 's negotiate position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers . </s>
we obviously reject all unrealistic demand which affect the European Parliament 's credibility . </s>
for me , that include the zero demand , I. E. the demand for zero input up to @card@ . </s>
that would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertaking . </s>
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already make considerable progress under current national and European water protection law , however imperfect they be and however little they be comply with in the Member States . </s>
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine , which would have be unthinkable @card@ year ago and that salmon be due to be release this spring in the Elbe , which be particularly polluted . </s>
that do not mean that we do not still have huge effort to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money . </s>
farmer have voice a number of concern over the past few day . </s>
you can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water . </s>
the line follow by our group for the negotiation with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be find for farmer too . </s>
I be horrify that both member of Parliament and the public have be mislead by false argument in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter . </s>
I therefore extend my special thank to my colleague in the group who help us find compromise . </s>
I also extend my special thank to our rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agree to differ on certain point . </s>
and I also thank the representative of the European Commission , who stand by with advice and expert help at all time . </s>
if the representative of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach , then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even good solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure . </s>
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she have present and on her effort in term of overcome the difference between us with regard to water . </s>
the framework directive on water be a necessary initiative . </s>
nevertheless , give that the idea of solidarity be central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resource should be see as a factor in social cohesion . </s>
nobody doubt that water be a resource of interest to all of us . </s>
however , in Spain and the other southern country , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resource require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measure . </s>
therefore , we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allow us to overcome territorial imbalance and , to this end , I ask that you support Amendment No @card@ , which have be present by our group . </s>
we wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promote the sustainable , efficient , fair and considerate use of water . </s>
I be now go to briefly discuss the main issue on which the Spanish socialist delegation differ somewhat from certain position which have be express here . </s>
One example be water transfer . </s>
we would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfer to Community supervision . </s>
we consider that , give the hydrological characteristic of Spain , where transfer of a structural nature be carry out , the authority of the country should make decision with regard to its own resource , and these decision should , of course , always be take in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water . </s>
with regard to one of the most controversial point of our debate , the application of tariff , the Spanish Socialists have be argue , in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay , that the directive should propose policy on accessible price for all level of consumption . </s>
in Spain , a policy of full recuperation of water cost would clearly not have the same effect as in the country of the centre and north of Europe . </s>
the Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different use , owe to the scarcity of water resource and the internalisation of the environmental cost which will have to be meet within the framework of the provision of the directive . </s>
we have therefore always argue for a progressive system of recuperation of cost . </s>
this system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effect , and its implementation should be modulate in accordance with differ geographical and climatic condition . </s>
we want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment . </s>
however , an environmental Europe can , in any circumstance , be build at different speed , but must be build from a point of view of solidarity . </s>
Mr President , the ecological disaster in the Danube remind us of how closely link all the country of Europe be and how important water be to us all . </s>
discharge from chemical factory in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beach of mainland Europe . </s>
this bring home the connection which bind us together . </s>
this framework directive be intend to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decade and there have be much panic over the detail . </s>
it be important for us to remember that this be a framework . </s>
these brushstrokes be indeed very broad . </s>
it be easy for individual country , for individual sector of industry , to escape the effect which have be paint to us in recent day . </s>
There be many opportunity to hide . </s>
the reality be that the detail of this legislation will be set out in daughter directive in month and year to come . </s>
that be the time to debate some of these problem of detail . </s>
the broad principle be surely one we should be able to accept - the broad principle that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leak into the groundwater , the broad principle that we should be aim to ensure that chemical , which we all need in society in all circumstance , should not be find their way into our water system . </s>
There be a chemical factory in the north-west which write to me to say that we must vote against this legislation . </s>
I would have to ask them what chemical they be put into the water supply at the moment and why they be not broadcast to all the resident in that area exactly what they be do . </s>
this be something that they prefer to avoid do . </s>
the principle also concern water charging . </s>
the basic understanding which many of us now share be that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make good use of our asset so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water . </s>
I want to refer to the political position here . </s>
the common position have weaken the stand take by Parliament at first reading . </s>
some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now frame be bad than useless . </s>
it be a retrograde step . </s>
this be an opportunity for us to improve the situation . </s>
we need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation . </s>
we have see vote after vote lose . </s>
measure after measure have come out of the Environment Committee . </s>
we have fail to achieve a qualified majority . </s>
our attempt to improve the environment of Europe have fail . </s>
we need to get into that conciliation position . </s>
we need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvement at a reasonable cost . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , as long as nearly thirty year ago , the European Commission make attempt to draw up a European water policy . </s>
a hundred and twenty-nine chemical substance have to be regulate . </s>
eventually , standard be draw up for only a dozen or so substance . </s>
the unanimity principle be at the root of this debacle . </s>
some seven year ago , it still look like the European water policy be go to be sacrifice on the altar of subsidiarity . </s>
the conservative government leader Messrs Major and Kohl decide in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it be totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drink water supply which be as good as those of the Germans or English . </s>
this sentiment be partly reflect in the common position which come about under British Socialist Presidency . </s>
that position be like holey cheese , or to keep it the sphere of water , as leaky as a sieve . </s>
it explain the ground swell of amendment which be table by the Committee on the Environment : nearly one hundred amendment for the second reading . </s>
this be unusual , but most of these amendment be desperately need to plug the hole . </s>
the dangerous chemical substance constitute a big leak . </s>
the chemical industry and , unfortunately , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance . </s>
this be very time-consuming , and , more importantly , there be no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substance . </s>
only the background level of the ocean be acceptable . </s>
this be what be mean by the term &quot; close-to-zero &quot; . </s>
the Commission already have a list of @card@ priority substance , many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect . </s>
these be so-called endocrine disrupter and cause , even in extremely minimal quantity , change in the gender of animal and even human , as be more and more be ascertain by scientist . </s>
this be why it be so important that the European Parliament declare itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year @card@ . </s>
I would like to mention two substance from the Commission 's list : mercury and tributyl , abbreviate to TBT . </s>
on the bottom of the Wadden Sea , the value of mercury and TBT be high than the OSPAR value , to wit , ten and one thousand time , respectively . </s>
the chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substance by harmless substitute , and if this be impossible , to apply them in closed system . </s>
for the substance TBT , this mean that it can no longer be use as an anti-fouling substance . </s>
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship 's side mechanically . </s>
I would like to finish off by express the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substance by the year @card@ . </s>
Mr President , the European Parliament have a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive . </s>
the Council 's common position be totally inadequate in a number of area . </s>
therefore , our task be to make the requirement in the directive tighter and more concrete . </s>
as member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , we regard certain principle as particularly important when we adopt a position on the different proposal . </s>
firstly , we think that the time-frame for implement the propose measure should be short than that propose by the Council . </s>
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allot for implement different part of the directive . </s>
secondly , I should like the phase out of noxious material to be carry out consistently . </s>
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criterion to be develop before the measure be implement . </s>
the legislation should also have write into it the fact that the international convention , such as the OSPAR Convention must be respect . </s>
thirdly , we should like a clear statement regard the pricing policy . </s>
this mean that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water use . </s>
nowadays , taxpayer often have to subsidise industry and farming . </s>
the obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluter or consumer pay , although exemption would be permit in extreme case . </s>
fourthly , we should like exemption from the rule on water status to be keep to a minimum and clearly define . </s>
fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measure against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear . </s>
against that background , our group be able to vote in favour of most of the amendment table by Mrs Lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopt in committee . </s>
we should like to see the scope of a couple of point extend . </s>
we will therefore vote for the Greens ' Amendments Nos @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , which we consider to be improvement on the present position . </s>
as regard pricing policy , there be sometimes extreme case which may require derogation from the principle lay down in the report . </s>
my own view be that the option for allow derogation have already be give proper attention in Amendment No @card@ , table by the committee and be even more clearly set out in the Greens ' Amendment No @card@ . </s>
I can see any need for other derogation besides those specify in the two amendment just mention . </s>
however , some people in our political group think otherwise . </s>
consequently , Amendment No @card@ , on the same question , have be table by one section of our group only . </s>
on the whole , I welcome the committee 's proposal set out in Mrs Lienemann 's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-win compromise . </s>
Mr President , every satellite photo prove that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the abundance of water be an illusion . </s>
the recent disaster on the Danube serve as a reminder that our river be the lifeline of our planet and that pollution do not respect border . </s>
water be a renewable but limited natural resource . </s>
it become scarce when it be mismanage and when the geographical and climatic condition be unfavourable . </s>
in the Eu , this be a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European country where we be witness the gradual dry of wet area . </s>
the increase in vulnerable area , both wet and dry , inequality between country , inequality between different region within country and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and geological event be all the evidence we need . </s>
however , these must not lead to competition distortion within the Community . </s>
we have therefore table amendment to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , give that water be an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land . </s>
agricultural need be clearly much great in the south and this specific point must be take into account in the framework directive . </s>
it be not only in the Member States that solution to these problem be be seek . </s>
last October in Turin , the country in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demand a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean . </s>
we be not , fortunately , at this point . </s>
however , we be in Europe experience drought and desertification in certain region and also flood , which the directive underline . </s>
for example , France , the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffer flooding . </s>
we need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various use of water compatible with each other . </s>
yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water . </s>
the water issue will definitely not be settle today . </s>
in fact , the problem of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospect . </s>
Mr President , it be very likely that , during this century , good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil . </s>
this be enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the effort she have make to obtain sound surface water . </s>
it seem rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework . </s>
with the framework directive on water policy , we be hope to end the fragmentation of the Eu 's water legislation . </s>
but that have not dismiss us from the task of draw up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive body . </s>
more specifically , the possibility for adopt a specific policy by Member States and water board , which have be set up thank to the catchment basin approach , need to be maximise . </s>
the key goal remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco system , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of flood and drought and the termination of discharge dangerous substance into surface water . </s>
as far as the discharge of these dangerous substance be concern , I be of the opinion that the Councils ' objective lack both commitment and ambition . </s>
the Committee on the Environment 's present proposal to reduce discharge to close-to-zero be , in my view , to be welcome and worthy of emulation . </s>
however , a great deal of attention must be pay to its viability . </s>
consideration must then be give to natural background emission which can be influence , as well as diffuse emission which be difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially . </s>
Mr President , we need to get use to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect . </s>
in the 20th century , water be merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substance , special waste , chemical and so on . </s>
and we can already see the consequence ! </s>
we need to rethink and recognise that water be our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it go far beyond the present generation . </s>
the directive must be negotiate accordingly and our citizen must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission be plan here . </s>
in the final analysis , water protection be not just a social question , it be a decisive social question , which be why the polluter pay principle must be apply more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequence . </s>
give the advanced state of pollution of water resource , it be important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvement . </s>
Mr President , it must be some six year ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , assist by Mrs Ursula Schleicher , put in a request and manage to overhaul the water policy in its entirety . </s>
it be not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the effort make by Mrs Lienemann be very laudable indeed . </s>
the decision-making process concern this framework directive on water have reach a crucial stage . </s>
the topic have be bring under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have be able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading . </s>
in fact , the common position which be issue at the end of last year be already a major improvement on the original proposal . </s>
it be also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancy be so huge . </s>
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect : in the North of Europe , we often face flood , but also polluted water , from industry , whilst the problem face the member in the South be often relate to transport water over long distance , simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture . </s>
I would like to enter into the two element of this topic in more detail . </s>
I would first of all like to focus on quality . </s>
the Netherlands be significantly affect by the European water policy . </s>
a very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , be extract from surface water in the Netherlands . </s>
the Netherlands be locate downstream , in a delta , which mean that the quality of the surface water which head our way be of key importance . </s>
another important point of discussion be the standardisation of water quality . </s>
in a number of amendment , the propose standard and especially the OSPAR standard for @card@ be call into question . </s>
although I understand that , accord to some , this standard be unclear or that it can be defend judicially , I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standard in a conciliation procedure . </s>
I would now like to say a few word on quantity management . </s>
in his poem &quot; Herinneringen aan Holland &quot; [ &quot; reminisce about Holland &quot; ] , a famous Dutch poet mention water too , which , with its never-end trail of destruction , be fear and respect . </s>
in @card@ , we suffer an enormous flood at a time when we be able to play a pioneer role in term of dam technology . </s>
when our river flood in @card@ , we establish that install artificial work upstream affect the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage . </s>
this mean that in term of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream be not affect by it . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to start by congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work . </s>
water be a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right . </s>
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water be not so self-evident , as many have experience in Southern Europe and be experience now in the Danube country too . </s>
water be often a source of conflict between country and people . </s>
this be why it be important that water become subject to international coordination . </s>
we need to recognise that water be a joint liability . </s>
cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident . </s>
too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problem downstream . </s>
coordination be the key word here . </s>
the problem of water be become increasingly topical . </s>
change in the climate and minor rise in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation . </s>
some area be become dry , whilst many be become wet . </s>
it be time for action . </s>
in March , the Second World Water Forum will be hold in the Hague . </s>
this Forum stand for a worldwide vision . </s>
this vision must translate into regional action plan for sustainable water management and water control . </s>
the time for action be upon us . </s>
the European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a start point and remain realistic at the same time . </s>
but we should not lower our standard too much either . </s>
the common position be not ambitious enough . </s>
this be why it be necessary to refer to previous international agreement , or the OSPAR objective . </s>
we need to aim for dangerous substance to be phase out by @card@ . </s>
this have be agree for the marine environment and it be obvious that this agreement will also apply to other water too . </s>
the OSPAR objective be now be draw up . </s>
a list have be compile , contain @card@ substance which produce clear risk for the environment . </s>
it be both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substance to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again . </s>
needless to say , the directive also need to be binding . </s>
country downstream must be able to count on the fact that country upstream meet the quality objective . </s>
quality have a price , but pollution could well have a much high price tag in future . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , my compliment to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive . </s>
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problem face us today in the shape of climate change , the depletion of primeval forest and overfishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some way , unowned resource . </s>
we should also recognise that , in Europe , our fresh water source may be say to be on the borderline between be own by everyone and by no-one . </s>
it be therefore strategically important that responsibility for water be establish . </s>
it be also important for the different watercourse to be keep together and manage as the totality they in fact be , irrespective of who own one section or another of a common watercourse . </s>
lady and gentleman , the proposal for a directive do indeed , as many speaker have already say , represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal Eu regulation and directive and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe . </s>
however , I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive be gear towards deregulation and renationalisation . </s>
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental point . </s>
First OSPAR . </s>
we know that the Commission proposal do not go far enough ; unfortunately this also apply to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment . </s>
merely pull proposal out of the air be not enough . </s>
What we need be a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR . </s>
only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objective which be enforceable under the law . </s>
anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disaster , such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary , from happen to us . </s>
I find it unfortunate that national government be not prepare to stand up for legally binding protection , despite have agree internationally on OSPAR . </s>
but I think that this be exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lose or compromise . </s>
it be also important to reinforce the polluter pay principle because price must speak the ecological truth . </s>
we must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyist ; on the contrary , we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pay principle and , hence , cost-covering price . </s>
water be our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentive and pressure be there to really comply with the OSPAR convention . </s>
with closed production circuit this be possible ; anything else would water down the directive . </s>
let us grab our chance . </s>
Mr President , in the small amount of time allot to me , I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann 's report and remind the House of three principle , to which all other principle must be subordinate , which be clearly express in the rapporteur 's amendment : water be not a commercial product , but the property of all the people of the Union ; the ultimate objective be to eliminate all pollutant in surface water and groundwater , and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively give that it be such a precious commodity . </s>
I know that this directive may have problem , give the differ situation of the various country of the Union , as have already be mention . </s>
the situation in the north be different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those country which have the problem of desert area . </s>
I understand this . </s>
however , there be some amendment which attempt to help the country of the south , specifically Amendment No @card@ which , with regard to the recuperation of cost , also indicate that Member States must take into account the social and environmental condition of the country when it come to decision making . </s>
There be also difficulty with the issue of transfer . </s>
in my country - I live in the north of Spain - , there be a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulty arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another . </s>
however , Mrs Lienemann 's report also say that the river basin receive the transfer water must save and protect their water . </s>
I know that this be a difficult report and that the differ situation of country cause difficulty , but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what be happen on the Danube and what happen in Doñana . </s>
we can allow our European water to be polluted , Mr President , and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of government to preserve the resource of water , which be so precious to all of us . </s>
Mr President , my compliment to the rapporteur on a splendid report . </s>
as an Irish Member of the European Parliament , come from a country which have large reserve of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposal include in this directive . </s>
however , I would now like to look at the area of difference between Parliament 's Committee on the Environment and the Council . </s>
the latter have already bring forward its common position on this matter . </s>
accord to the Council the objective of achieve good surface water status should be secure no later than @card@ year after the directive enter into force , whereas Parliament 's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shorten to ten year . </s>
I see no reason why European Union Member States can work to implement the key provision of this directive in as short a time as possible . </s>
I now turn to the amendment to be table before Parliament tomorrow concern the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage . </s>
the Council in its common position state that the European Union government must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage . </s>
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle be include in the common position . </s>
amendment no @card@ seek to ensure that by the year @card@ water pricing policy in Europe must provide adequate incentive to use water efficiently . </s>
moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sector , break down into industrial , household and agricultural sector , must ensure that this policy be implement . </s>
unless these amendment be support tomorrow a strong message will be send out that meter and water rate should be implement for household right across the European Union state . </s>
this be politically impractical from an Irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other Eu Member States such as Portugal , Greece and Spain . </s>
Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report . </s>
it be here and now that we decide to what extent the Eu country be to work effectively for a clean aquatic environment in the year to come . </s>
we can do this by , as a Parliament , amend the Council 's common position and show the way forward in work for a clean environment . </s>
in its unaltered form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long-term consequence for the environment and for our drinking water . </s>
it would be to send out the wrong signal both to European industry and to the European people . </s>
it be crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharge of chemical into our water . </s>
the directive quite obviously provide too extend a time frame within which time be to be spend measure every single one of the approximately @card@ chemical in circulation . </s>
we can afford to wait . </s>
in this connection , I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No @card@ , in which the word &quot; water pollution cause by individual pollutant &quot; be replace by &quot; prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharge &quot; . </s>
we can delay environmental work by go into inordinate detail rather than work on reduce total discharge of hazardous substance into the environment . </s>
the Eu 's Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention , which now already define what be hazardous to the environment . </s>
this convention should be our guide in work for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our descendant . </s>
Mr President , it be difficult to summarise the area cover by such a large and complex directive . </s>
the Treaty of Amsterdam reiterate the priority criterion for prevention , for the implementation of the ' polluter pay ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment . </s>
clearly , the importance of recognise the economic value of ecological factor in set price and make operator accountable through the adoption of incentive for non-pollute system , seem unquestionable in the light of event that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage , particularly our water resource . </s>
this situation be loudly echo in many sector of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector . </s>
the concept of good agricultural practice have be introduce in amongst the complexity of the current relationship between agriculture , environment and water resource , and between positive and negative effect , and amongst the wide range of local reality and production system and so on . </s>
this concept indicate which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resource that surpass basic standard , along with the subsequent cost and reduction in income . </s>
the obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derive from this notion , with the aim of keep the management of water resource at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current condition . </s>
we must not , with this in mind , pursue a strategy of separate the objective of prevent a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objective of protect , improve and restore their quality , as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priority detrimental to the overall functioning of intervention and specific measure that target a combined approach and the use of the well available technique . </s>
as regard eliminate the pollution generate by dangerous substance in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community level , which enable clear identification of the various class of body of water polluted as a result of human production activity . </s>
finally , we need to set up a system which prepare an objective list of potentially dangerous substance , use the increase information available on their chemical , physical and biological property , in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic level in order to protect our water heritage , which be fundamental to us all . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , if we be to take the principle of sustainability enshrine in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously , then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero input in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generation do not pay the price for our water consumption . </s>
we can achieve this long-term objective by develop measure with demand standard . </s>
in this respect , I fully support the amendment propose by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach use quality standard so that we can eventually say that , when people use water , they be not consuming it but maintain present stock . </s>
this directive contain a number of very positive element which be worth highlight . </s>
first there be wide information for and involvement by the public , a rarity in a European directive . </s>
secondly , there be compulsory cooperation . </s>
I be glad a holistic approach to water be be take here and that authority in the individual national state and beyond the border of the national state be at last oblige to work together and ensure that water be of a high quality . </s>
thirdly , I should like to address the question of the timetable . </s>
I be firmly convince that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective . </s>
compare it with what happen in December . </s>
we all know in December that Christmas Eve fall on 24th December and we start buy present . </s>
but what would we do if we know in December that Christmas be in thirty year ' time . </s>
we all know what we would do , which be why we need a tight timetable for our water policy . </s>
I emphatically support the rapporteur 's proposal and think that we need a tight timetable for all area of the directive , from the list of measure to the question of employment measure . </s>
Mr President , the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater , drink water and surface water and that the level of protection correspond to exist Eu environmental legislation . </s>
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolution concern the Nitrates Directive have still not be implement in all Member States , in spite of the fact that there be a common Eu resolution . </s>
the present proposal tighten up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of way which exceed our current environmental objective . </s>
it be propose that a target should be achieve for concentration in the aquatic environment which be close to the background value for naturally occur substance and close to zero for humanly produce synthetic substance . </s>
this can be do , and it also , in any case , go against nature . </s>
adopt this report would have serious consequence for agriculture in the Eu if concentration of , for example , phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background value for these substance in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero be to be establish for pesticide in the aquatic environment . </s>
European agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be use for make bread . </s>
as a result , agricultural production would move to other country outside the Eu , with consequent high socio-economic and employment cost . </s>
I can vote in favour of the section in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these state of affair . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , water be a precious raw material . </s>
million of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal . </s>
it should , therefore , not surprise us that water be the cause of war . </s>
the capitalist world too send out its pawn in order to gain maximum control over water reservoir . </s>
general interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation . </s>
Europe be therefore face an arduous task ; that of combine a Community water policy which be fragment in term of objective and mean into more coherent framework legislation . </s>
I have to admit that in Flanders , where I come from , we still have a long way to go too . </s>
we be recently rap on the knuckle by the Commission regard this matter . </s>
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive use as a big stick for those pursue policy who be now fail in some way . </s>
the common position be in this respect a farce , a document with no string attach and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreement . </s>
the period of implementation can even be extend up to @card@ year . </s>
by then , my child will be old than I be now . </s>
you have to admit : this be a joke . </s>
tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruin the future of our child . </s>
either we opt for the amendment of my group , of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment . </s>
I would like to finish off with this observation . </s>
in the past couple of month , we have witness a great deal of lobby in Belgium . </s>
What be remarkable about this dossier be the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers . </s>
in our own country , this pressure be exert by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administration . </s>
they have opt for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament 's more drastic positioning . </s>
I really do wonder whether this be an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country be aware . </s>
lady and gentleman , fine word be no longer sufficient . </s>
we need to change tack completely . </s>
during the vote tomorrow , we can make it clear that Europe be draft a responsible and future-orientated water policy . </s>
this can only benefit our credibility . </s>
the debate be suspend and will resume at 9 p. m. the dialogue on Europe - institutional reform the next item be the Commission communication - the dialogue on Europe - institutional reform : the issue at stake . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Commission be discuss this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work be complete today . </s>
I be basically here to speak to you , as indicate by your agenda , on a new initiative which the Commission be propose as just one of its response to the major challenge of institutional reform . </s>
this reform must involve all the actor in European construction , with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner , the Council minister and national MP . </s>
it must also involve the official who work in our various institution and who be commit to and motivate by this European construction . </s>
this morning , in the lengthy debate which I attend with Mr Prodi , many of you mention the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institution . </s>
yet it be not just a question of who do what , as one of you say very clearly and forcefully . </s>
ensure that our citizen understand who do what in our various institution be the very least we can do . </s>
we must also now explain what we be do together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the country which will be join us . </s>
we too be concern about this lack of democracy , and the Commission have therefore decide to launch the ' Dialogue on Europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people . </s>
this initiative will be launch on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
during the IGC I will have the honour of represent the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of work closely with your two representative , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos . </s>
All the commissioner have undertake to use some of their time when they go to any country or region , and not just their own , which in my case happen three or four time a month , to engage in direct dialogue with the public , and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course . </s>
we also plan to establish direct contact in university , school and factory , to meet the people , answer their question and listen to them . </s>
in this way we will play our part , as will you , in make the necessary effort and meet the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizen from what we do . </s>
we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament . </s>
we will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measure and we can adjust or reorient the work . </s>
we also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliament , local elected representative , non-governmental organisation , socio-professional organisation and the medium . </s>
opinion multiplier , political group and party , MEPs and national MP , elect representative , as I have just say , local authority or national parliament , the Committee of the region , the Economic and Social Committee , organisation stem from civil society and university and education circle will all be involve . </s>
need I remind you that the European Parliament itself take the initiative on 1 February ? </s>
I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organise an initial work meeting with the representative of the national parliament who be , of course , the representative of the people in each Member State . </s>
the Commission will propose that the Member States become involve in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership . </s>
we be set up a medium plan and close contact with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament . </s>
I have indicate the condition under which the commissioner will play their part through public meeting and visit . </s>
we want to encourage debate among the people . </s>
without presume to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you , may I just point out that , when it be my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country , I see the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people ? </s>
each week , when engage in this dialogue in each region , I realise that there be a real need for the European Union to have a face . </s>
I therefore take a European Commissioner , and not just the French one , or ambassador post in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week . </s>
this make me realise that people have many intelligent question and that they need to be respect , listen to and inform . </s>
so this be what we be go to do . </s>
we will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for @card@ which you will hopefully approve . </s>
financing from the @card@ budget must also be negotiate as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both @card@ and @card@ . </s>
it will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process . </s>
we will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of @card@ young Commission stagiaires . </s>
your President , Mrs Fontaine , have agree to take part with Mr Prodi and several commissioner in this initial dialogue . </s>
I can assure you that , whenever a Commissioner intend to engage in dialogue , the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament . </s>
that be all I have to say for the moment . </s>
I welcome any question , suggestion or proposal from the member present . </s>
colleague , you know the rule . </s>
you be expect to ask question , not necessarily make lengthy statement . </s>
you have one minute each in which to ask your question . </s>
Mr President , I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair , in express my appreciation of this Commission initiative . </s>
moreover , this initiative be consistent with recommendation make by Parliament itself in its resolution of @card@ November . </s>
I have also hear Commissioner Barnier 's clarification of relation and link with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme . </s>
if I may make a suggestion , Commissioner Barnier , would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject , in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicate that it will be carry out in conjunction with the European Parliament ? </s>
it would be helpful to stress this convergence of intention and effort because I can see a particular problem with coordination , specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly do not only address member of national parliament , but also member of national parliament - and our committee 's programme . </s>
follow the work meeting of 1 February , which Commissioner Barnier refer to and which benefit from the weighty contribution of the Commission , the committee intend to take stock of development at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meeting . </s>
we therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of member of national parliament at all of our meeting , and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the one in the Commission 's initiative . </s>
thank you , Mr Napolitano . </s>
I can confirm that our proposal be completely within the spirit of the resolution of @card@ November . </s>
I also want at this stage to say that I be able to propose this initiative to the Commission thank to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague , Viviane Reding . </s>
this initiative be also establish in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involve all the major challenge of enlargement , both its opportunity and risk , and of institutional reform . </s>
these challenge must be explain to our citizen who be concern about them and question them . </s>
I understand your concern , Mr Napolitano , and an interinstitutional working group will be set up . </s>
its first meeting should take place in March . </s>
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry term of the Commission 's text and it will certainly be more a question of share the work than work in liaison with each other . </s>
I will also ensure that over the next two year we can coordinate the initiative take by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint . </s>
you realise that make a success of this dialogue mean work for everyone concern . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , it be music to my ear to hear you use the word ' citizen ' so often . </s>
we be increasingly concern in this house about public opinion . </s>
the fear of public opinion be a rather paternalistic concept but our house be what it be and we must do what we can with it . </s>
in term of the IGC issue , I have a specific question for you . </s>
I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg be currently look very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and Olaf . </s>
as you know , there be problem which not only concern this House but also the European official who be also European citizen . </s>
give the urgency surround this issue , have the Commission consider the possibility of completely change the structure of the anti-fraud office by move to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud , in the Member States and in the European institution , come under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice ? </s>
Mr Dupuis , first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word ' citizen ' . </s>
it be one of the most wonderful word in a democracy and must be use . </s>
we will conduct this dialogue with our citizen , include the most disadvantaged and those isolate from decision-making or information centre . </s>
with regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud , and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interest , we have retain the idea in our proposal of create a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor . </s>
we have do this in the spirit of this House 's work and perhaps by go down the same road . </s>
this public prosecutor would have the authority , recognise by the Eu Treaty and therefore by the Member States , to investigate thoroughly any case threaten the Community budget and interest . </s>
we can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation be now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originate from inside or outside the Community . </s>
this be why we have propose the creation of a European public prosecutor who could , have investigate a case from start to finish , then have this investigate and rule on by the most appropriate national court . </s>
in reply to your second point on the Court of Justice , we have not yet establish our position on the Court of Justice because we be wait for the Dur report which be publish a few day ago . </s>
the Commission , as I have promise , will complete its proposal on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few week . </s>
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the day before yesterday , there be a lead news item in the most popular Danish news programme , which I would ask you to comment on . </s>
the story go that an official in the Commission have apparently tell an Austrian businessman that , because he be Austrian , he would possibly be exclude from be able to participate in a scientific development project together with business in other country , include Denmark . </s>
I would ask you to confirm that , if an official have say that an Austrian company be in some way exclude from participate in joint development project , then this official have get the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he have not say this , then there be no story . </s>
Will you confirm what be the case ? </s>
Mr Haarder , to my knowledge no official have be authorise to say such a thing . </s>
my personal opinion be that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people , business and employee because of concern prompt by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition . </s>
therefore , subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sit , I can confirm what you have just say , that the Commission have never say or authorise anything of this sort . </s>
generally speak , there be other lesson to be learn from what be happen in Austria . </s>
I have myself suggest various possible response to this challenge which serve to remind us all once more what we have be do together since @card@ . </s>
this be an economic community , of course , but it be also , primarily , a community of value . </s>
this be why we be draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizen on an individual basis . </s>
this be why we have Article @card@ of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we propose , in our opinion of @card@ January even before the Austrian crisis , should be apply after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity . </s>
this be why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the Eu Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitor procedure a legal basis . </s>
finally , this be why we have public debate . </s>
the only way to eliminate misconceive idea be to offer alternative , which bring me back to the subject of our discussion . </s>
I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate , particularly to fight against demagoguery . </s>
Commissioner Barnier , you lay great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizen of Europe . </s>
with reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decision the Portuguese Presidency be give the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC . </s>
clearly , Parliament have its own representative present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos . </s>
but would you , Commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda be enlarge by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continue that dialogue with the citizen on which you have lay such stress ? </s>
Mr Beazley , my answer be clearly yes but that be no surprise . </s>
Mr Napolitano , the chairman , and many other member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that , on behalf of the Commission , I will be available to tell you how thing be go as they happen throughout these negotiation , in a spirit of transparency . </s>
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who be your direct representative but it be also probable that , in many case , we will say this together . </s>
it be very important that these negotiation be not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliament which , when all say and do , will have their opinion to give and their position to take in the ratification process . </s>
this be why I congratulate Mr Napolitano 's initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliament of the Fifteen and the European Parliament . </s>
have say that , the duty of transparency and debate start here with regard to the reform of the institution . </s>
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our position and the progress be make in these negotiation throughout this year . </s>
Mr President , firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach . </s>
I think it be extremely useful to open up the communication channel with the citizen at an early stage . </s>
this do not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this have only lead to a great deal of mistrust . </s>
I have two question . </s>
firstly , you mention that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizen and I be already make a start with the @card@ placement student at the European Commission . </s>
do you intend to address the citizen via the medium as well , that be to say via the television and Internet ? </s>
my second question be of a critical nature . </s>
the European Commission have just issue a proposal on transparency . </s>
if I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertain to legislation in the Netherlands , then the European model be vastly overshadow by the Dutch model , and that proposal have meet with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands . </s>
my question be really : how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC , because the present directive be not a good example of this . </s>
Mrs Maij-Weggen , give that we be talk about ensure transparency in the IGC , it be clear how business will be conduct and the negotiation be start right now . </s>
the group of representative be currently meet in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible . </s>
the document will in the main be open working document . </s>
although the negotiation session which will take place throughout the year between minister and the European Council will not be open to the medium , I be commit , as I must be at this stage , to ensure this transparency and report in the most appropriate arena on these negotiation and the Commission 's viewpoint . </s>
I can confirm , and thank you for have ask me about this , that we will use all the most modern mean , television in particular , to broadcast our public debate in each country and even across Europe . </s>
we will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forum . </s>
the commissioner will undertake to respond rapidly to any question raise . </s>
these be the modern mean to be use . </s>
however , I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people . </s>
although this may be a rather Utopian ideal , I want a Commissioner , when he can , an MEP , a minister to attend public debate in all the region of Europe . </s>
I have evidence that this be possible . </s>
the majority of you hold these debate in your constituency and region . </s>
although this may seem rather egotistical , I want the Commission , in the mind of the people , to have a face and for those people form the Commission to be able to meet our citizen as often as possible . </s>
Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier 's commitment to go to the region , both to explain and to listen to what citizen have to say . </s>
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire , a major European region that be a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding . </s>
he can come with both the hat that he wear as a Commissioner . </s>
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ? </s>
in some Member States it be not just a matter of provide information to a public that be not as well inform as it might be . </s>
that be certainly important but it be also a question of combat the misinformation that be put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisation that exist . </s>
the Commission will have to be very vigorous in the response that it put out to some of the comment that it will be receive as part of the campaign . </s>
Mr Corbett , thank you for your comment . </s>
I willingly accept your invitation . </s>
if I have understand you correctly , you want me , when I come to Yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the European institution but also the structural fund . </s>
I can perform this dual task . </s>
I forget to mention my intention to go before the national parliament , as I have already do , not only by meet their representative here but by go to see them in situ . </s>
Ten day ago I be in Westminster , so you can see , Mr Corbett , that I be not afraid of the difficulty . </s>
next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin . </s>
I have already appear before the French Senate . </s>
therefore , throughout this debate , whenever I can , I will go directly to see the national parliament too . </s>
with regard to the dialogue with our citizen , it be not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication . </s>
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue . </s>
so , after a short film objectively explain the challenge of institutional reform , those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion . </s>
I will say again that we be go to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States . </s>
I sincerely hope , with your support , that the government of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate . </s>
Mr President , I should like to join Mr Barnier 's study group with the @card@ trainee so that he have some people to discuss matter with . </s>
it be not much fun , of course , have to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conference with yourself . </s>
in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference , Mr Barnier say , during his presentation in Parliament , that social policy be not to be subject to majority decision-making but , when I look at page @card@ , I see that right of travel and of residence - that be to say , the Residence Directives - , combat discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No @card@ and , with a few exception , of arrangement in the socio-political sphere be to be subject to qualified majority voting . </s>
be not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrate the inner working of the Member States ' election process ? </s>
it be , of course , these issue which people go to the poll about and which lead to new majority in the Folketing and other parliament . </s>
Can such matter be control from Brussels ? </s>
be this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talk about this morning ? </s>
I be very glad to learn last week that the Commission be give close attention over a number of year to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference , not merely to relation between the Union and Member States , but also the Union , the Member States , region and city . </s>
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the region of Europe , Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hear . </s>
commissioner , I want to go back to one of your previous answer . </s>
in this you mention what I would refer to as the possibility of protect the Eu Treaty against any risk of deviation and , in particular , the variation of penalty which may be impose on a Member State , pursuant to Article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedom . </s>
do you believe that these proposal , or proposal of this type , form part of the mandate of the IGC as define in Helsinki ? </s>
I do not think so . </s>
be you not afraid that such penalty might get out of hand and serve to punish not violation of human right but simple difference of opinion , unpopular opinion or deviation from the dominant European thinking ? </s>
yes , Mr Bonde , we will be start this debate with @card@ young people in Brussel who be go to be work in the institution and with the Commission . </s>
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who be motivate . </s>
in term of social protection , I can confirm that we have make proposal about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these be regardless of ideology . </s>
in your country , Mr Bonde , like everywhere else , I believe people be keen for the internal market to work properly under the fair condition of competition and movement of good and people . </s>
this will therefore be our rule . </s>
we be propose that decision on certain policy or measure involve taxation or social protection and social security should be take by qualified majority voting when there be a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market . </s>
our proposal be not general or systematic . </s>
I be well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issue . </s>
I do not believe that all the national system of social protection should be make identical . </s>
this have never be the case . </s>
we be simply try to ensure , in a Europe with @card@ or @card@ Member States , the good condition for the operation of the internal market without one country be able to block the other @card@ or @card@ . </s>
Mr MacCormick , I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capital . </s>
it must get as close as possible to the people , where they live and where they have their root . </s>
if I say anything different I would be contradict myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which be one of the most specific and most visible policy for increase employment and improve the quality of life of people in their region . </s>
you will often hear me say that this policy do not just have one main objective of achieve cohesion and solidarity between the region but that it be intend in addition to help people , where they live , to preserve their root , tradition , soul and identity . </s>
we will therefore conduct this dialogue with the town and region . </s>
Mr Berthu , the Helsinki mandate be clear and we be work within this . </s>
it specify that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issue which be leave out in Amsterdam . </s>
it also add related institutional question and issue which may be include in the negotiation depend on the Portuguese and French presidency . </s>
the Commission be act correctly if , on a particular point , it believe it must add to its opinion which cover many institutional question . </s>
I be not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7 . </s>
however , if we do , this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which be sufficiently serious that the fourteen government of the Union must mobilise together to give their response . </s>
we will also do this with regard for the future in general . </s>
we will use all the mean available to permanently strengthen the community of value which we have be build together since the founding of the Union in @card@ , and even before that , on the rubble of the Second World War . </s>
Everything which can be do will be useful . </s>
I be sure that you and I , Mr Berthu , can at least agree on this . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
you have answer the question precisely and also open the dialogue for Europe that you refer to . </s>
you have set a very good example of time-keeping today . </s>
that conclude the debate . </s>
question Time ( Commission ) the next item be Question Time ( B5-0009 / @card@ ) . </s>
we will examine question to the Commission . </s>
first part question no @card@ by ( H-0025 / @card@ ) : subject : high infant mortality in Kosovo accord to the late UN datum receive from the World Health Organisation , Kosovo have the high rate of infant mortality in Europe ; almost @card@ % of baby bear prematurely die , while the war have produce a steep rise in miscarriage and child who manage to go to term be small than the norm . </s>
in the context of the humanitarian aid provide by the Union and the effort of its envoy Bernard Kouchner , will the Commission say what measure have be take to safeguard the woman of Kosovo 's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant woman , woman in childbirth and baby ? </s>
Mr President , the Commission be conscious of the very difficult situation concern health and health facility in Kosovo , not just for pregnant woman but across the board . </s>
this result both from the recent conflict and from the year of neglect and lack of maintenance that precede it . </s>
the statistic quote on child mortality speak for themselves and be wholly unacceptable . </s>
however , the situation be hardly good for other part of the population . </s>
the Commission 's response have be as follow : firstly , the health sector have be a significant beneficiary of Echo funding . </s>
echo be currently focus on the provision of medical supply and emergency health care , on support to institution as well as vaccination . </s>
however , effort be increasingly orient towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province . </s>
UNMIK have already take a significant role in this field . </s>
secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica have already be initiate with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme . </s>
progress be slow due to the tense relation between the ethnic group of this divide city . </s>
however , the Commission be maintain its effort with the support of UNMIK for this project . </s>
we hope that one day it may become a symbol promote the benefit of ethnic reconciliation . </s>
under the European Community 's damage assessment , estimate cost of the reconstruction of healthcare facility and provision of equipment to dispensary and health house amount to EUR 4 million . </s>
the Commission be now turn to the programming of @card@ fund . </s>
we expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improve the healthcare system . </s>
the emphasis will be on long-term reform cover health financing as well as training and procurement . </s>
work be already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise . </s>
Commissioner , this morning President Prodi , among other , stress that the Balkans be test our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the European Union be on trial , and the gap between word and deed must finally be close . </s>
Commissioner , do you really think that the fact we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the high in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevail in Kosovo , be not already damage our credibility and cast doubt on our ability to live up to our promise ? </s>
besides , Commissioner , be so-called humanitarian military intervention justify by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo ? </s>
do you think that so much inaction be excusable when , on the continent of Europe itself , the right to life be at risk ? </s>
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have be work incredibly hard in Kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their labour to suggest that they have be stand idly by . </s>
I be sure the honourable Member do not mean that . </s>
of course , she be entirely correct in say that the Union 's credibility be on the line with what happen , not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole . </s>
I be very concern that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance . </s>
I would just make two point about the situation in Kosovo which we be address as enthusiastically as we can along who line . </s>
first of all , I be sure that the honourable Member recognise that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfund the health service in Kosovo , and many Albanian find that they be not really receive any health care at all . </s>
as a result of that , a parallel health care system be put in place through the Mother Teresa Society . </s>
so what we be deal with be not just the consequence of conflict but the consequence of year of neglect and chronic under-investment . </s>
secondly , and I be sure that the honourable Member recognise this as well , some of the tragic storey to come out of Kosovo in recent week have not be about child mortality during carriage of a baby , but child mortality after a healthy baby have be bear . </s>
those be case in which woman who during the hostility , or before the hostility , tragically kill their own child . </s>
we be deal with a horrific story in Kosovo . </s>
we have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in other to restore something approach civilised standard and civilised behaviour , but it be not go to be easy . </s>
commissioner , I would like to thank you for your response to the Member 's first question and the supplementary question . </s>
however , I still have some contact in Kosovo who have inform me that food package which be distribute by Echo , among other , be often of inferior quality . </s>
in some case , there have be incident of food contain insect and such like . </s>
be you aware of this ? </s>
be you prepare to act upon it ? </s>
this be my first additional question . </s>
my second question pertain to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica . </s>
you be perhaps aware that this hospital be locate in the northern part of the city and that , give the tense situation , Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all . </s>
What do the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital ? </s>
on the first question , I be go myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation make by the honourable Member about the Echo food package . </s>
I have not hear that suggestion before , but it be an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I be there . </s>
secondly , I do understand exactly what the honourable Member be say about Mitrovica . </s>
I be in Mitrovica a couple of month ago , I see the situation there for myself . </s>
I have discussion with municipal leader from both community , include the leader of the Albanian side who have himself in the past be a doctor and be generally recognise for the medical work he have do during the hostility and subsequently . </s>
so I know the very serious problem that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be do all that we can to see that adequate health facility be available for everybody in Kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from . </s>
the particular difficulty in Mitrovica - for example , it be not just a question of Albanian patient have difficulty get to hospital , Albanian staff have have difficulty work there - be particularly acute problem . </s>
we will try to address them , but it be not easy . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0029 / @card@ ) : subject : Turkish blockade of Armenia give that the European Union be actively promote social , economic and political relation with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement sign on @card@ October @card@ , what step be the Commission take to persuade the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ? </s>
the Commission support any effort aim at the settlement of the dispute between Turkey and Armenia and regret that there have not yet be any normalisation of relation between these two country . </s>
in the present political circumstance it be however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey , as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be open without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict . </s>
Mr President , the Commission will be hold negotiation in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union . </s>
Will it make it a condition that negotiation can only start if the blockade be lift because , in the final analysis , we be all neighbour and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relation inside the European Union ? </s>
my question therefore be this : will the Commission make this one of the condition in order to improve future discussion ? </s>
the key issue be to support the effort of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can . </s>
we have also be substantial contributor of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia . </s>
let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union . </s>
the situation of Turkey 's relation with its neighbour will , as the honourable Member ask , be closely examine in the framework of the pre-accession strategy . </s>
as state in Agenda @card@ - and I quote : &quot; enlargement should not mean import border conflict &quot; . </s>
that statement could not be much clear . </s>
but I repeat that the most important contribution we can make be to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which have have such harmful economic and humanitarian result . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0040 / @card@ ) : subject : implication for human right of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey give that Turkey have recently be grant applicant country status , what be the Commission 's view of the implication for human right of the construction of the Ilisu Dam , give the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result ? </s>
the Commission have no information regard the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region . </s>
we will , however , consider raise the matter with the Turkish authority , together with other issue concern regional development policy in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey . </s>
I have a related point . </s>
it concern the implication of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole . </s>
as you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular . </s>
give the extreme volatility of this region and give the very real concern of many commentator that we will see an increase incidence of conflict , of so-called &quot; water war &quot; , in the come decade , what be the Commission 's view about the potential destabilisation , both in Turkey and in the wide region , that will be cause by this dam ? </s>
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ? </s>
we will certainly raise the point make by the honourable Member . </s>
we have hear anxiety express on that point and I will ensure it be take up . </s>
There have also be considerable anxiety express about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area . </s>
we will raise that , too , in the representation we make . </s>
a number of other hydro-electric scheme plan over the last @card@ year in Turkey have raise matter of concern , such as the effect on displace farmer . </s>
on the whole those seem to have be deal with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - be not a project in which the Commission be participate in any form . </s>
we thank Mr Patten for have reply on behalf of the Commission . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0036 / @card@ ) : subject : draft of Charter of Fundamental Rights the general public welcome the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights be to be draw up . </s>
it be also to be hope that it will meet the challenge of Europe in the 21st century . </s>
What be the Commission 's view on the substance of the Charter ? </s>
What type of right will the Charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ? </s>
which citizen will it cover ( those of the European Union or the citizen of all European country with a view to enlargement ? </s>
Will it cover immigrant etc . </s>
? </s>
) Will it set out established social right in the European Union or will it set a broad agenda ? </s>
What mean will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantee equality between the sex ? </s>
What be the Commission 's view on incorporate the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ? </s>
like the honourable Member , the Commission welcome the decision take by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
in the conclusion of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even establish the broad outline of the Charter 's content . </s>
accord to these conclusion , the Charter must contain three category of right . </s>
the first category be right of freedom and equality and procedural right , as guarantee by the European convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental freedom . </s>
the second be the right reserve for citizen of the European Union . </s>
the third be economic and social right , as contain in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers , insofar as they do not merely establish objective for action by the Union . </s>
the Commission consider that the convention responsible for draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate give by the Cologne European Council . </s>
have say that , this do not mean that the convention should be limit to a codify role of simply compile the exist right from various source . </s>
as I have say before in this House , the Commission be convince that the convention must be able , if necessary , to adapt and develop these right in view of current circumstance , particularly technological and social change . </s>
however , give the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submit to the Heads of State and Government , this power must be exercise with caution and on a case-by-case basis . </s>
the right confer by this Charter will have at least two type of beneficiary . </s>
some right will apply to anyone present in the Eu territory while other will benefit only citizen of the European Union . </s>
it may also be envisage that some economic and social right could be guarantee only for citizen of the European Union and third-country national meet certain condition . </s>
it be not possible at this initial stage of the process of draw up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail . </s>
however , I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between man and woman will certainly be include among the right guarantee by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
this be because this principle already figure among the right guarantee by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitute a common constitutional tradition in the Member States . </s>
as I have also say before to this House , the Commission be favourable to insert the Charter in the Eu Treaty . </s>
however , we be fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government . </s>
the difficult part , which will fall to the convention , be therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrate as such into the treaty . </s>
in its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the treaty , the Commission note that the European Council must decide during the year @card@ on the inclusion of certain item on the IGC agenda , in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
commissioner , it be quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe , man and woman , be be call upon to redefine their right and obligation . </s>
we hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality . </s>
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those right . </s>
Seattle be a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a waste meeting . </s>
but if we be to secure the public 's participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the European body and specifically the Commission be propose as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century . </s>
I listen to your general guideline and I would like to ask you what be the position of child , as entity in their own right , in the Commission 's plan for the new model of society in the twenty-first century . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , in my opinion , and as Mr Prodi say this morning , the draw up of the Charter be an exercise with great political significance . </s>
this be because it show that the Union place the fundamental right of citizen at the top of the political concern for the future of our common project . </s>
in this context , the criterion by which these right be to be choose must be clearly indicate . </s>
the essential criterion be the right of citizen with regard to the European institution , as contain in the European project enshrine in the treaty of the European Union . </s>
I understand your concern about the right of child . </s>
Many element of our work , and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs , involve protect the right of child . </s>
this be an area in which the principle of subsidiarity apply fully . </s>
each Member State be principally responsible for define its responsibility towards child . </s>
as for the Eu 's responsibility , the right of child must be recognise in the Charter accord to the area in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broad sense , of child . </s>
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member have pose for the Commission and the whole convention . </s>
Mr President , I have have the privilege of hear the Commissioner a number of time on this issue and I very much agree with his approach . </s>
however , I should like to ask a slightly different question . </s>
we have just hear Commissioner Barnier say that he be anxious to communicate good with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issue that the Community be deal with this year . </s>
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards inform and consult the citizen on this issue of a Citizens Charter ? </s>
it be very important that the people feel engage in this process . </s>
I know that the convention itself will do much in this area but it do not have the resource that the Commission have . </s>
Will the Commission look at use its information budget to ensure people be engage in this debate ? </s>
it be the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights , not only with non-governmental organisation but also with the citizen in a project as far-reaching as the Charter be . </s>
I can assure you that the Commission will do its good to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
we can achieve the good of both world by have a clear text , a text that can be easily read by the citizen , and at the same time a text that can be use as a legal instrument . </s>
There be no contradiction between the two . </s>
the challenge we have be to bring them together in the final version of the Charter . </s>
I be very glad to know that I can count on your support here . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0095 / @card@ ) : subject : article @card@ , @card@ and @card@ of the Treaty on European Union Article @card@ of the Treaty state that the Union be base on principle of liberty , democracy , respect for human right and fundamental freedom . </s>
it be clear from statement over the past year that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human right and fundamental freedom with respect to third country national and minority group live in Austria . </s>
therefore , will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article @card@ that there be ' the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principle mention in Article @card@ . </s>
' , and urge the Council act by qualified majority to suspend certain right derive from the application of this Treaty to Austria include the voting right of the representative of Austria in the Council ? </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to begin my answer by remind you of the position adopt by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian government . </s>
this be reiterate this morning in President Romano Prodi 's speech on that government which include Ministers from Jörg Haider 's Freedom Party . </s>
I be refer , of course , to the statement make by the Commission on 1 February @card@ , the basic element of which I would like to restate . </s>
the Commission confirm then , as it do today , that it share the concern underlie the Portuguese Presidency 's statement of 1 February @card@ . </s>
these concern be legitimate and there be good reason for them . </s>
There be no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider 's political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statement , which be also anti-European . </s>
the fact that an openly extremist , racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other state that be take part in the European project . </s>
the European Commission be certainly not indifferent to the matter either . </s>
secondly , the Commission reiterate and reiterate again its commitment to continue fulfill its duty as guardian of the treaty , specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union . </s>
One of the most important innovation provide by the Treaty of Amsterdam be to clarify the basic principle which represent the share heritage of the Member States . </s>
another innovation be the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principle be be fulfill , and which would react if any of them be violate . </s>
the Commission thereby give a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillar : that of the rule of law . </s>
this principle mean that the Commission must act within the limit lay down by the treaty and it be in this context that the statement of 1 February be make . </s>
the Commission be not a state . </s>
it can and must not act as if it be one . </s>
in order to give a precise answer to your question , Mr Ford , I must remind you that in order for the mechanism establish by Article @card@ of the Treaty on European Union to be apply , there must be proof of the existence and I quote , of a &quot; serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principle mention in Article 6 . </s>
&quot; I repeat , a &quot; serious and persistent breach &quot; be the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the council that measure be adopt against a Member State . </s>
I think that it be obvious that condition have not be meet which would apply to the current situation in Austria . </s>
as a matter of fact I think that I be right in say that we all hope that these condition of a serious and persistent breach of human right and of democracy be never fulfill , either in Austria or in any other Member State . </s>
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission , as state once again by President Prodi this morning , to do everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism state in Article 7 . </s>
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary . </s>
the value at stake be too central , too fundamental for us to accept dither or compromise . </s>
individual and government should be judge by what they do rather than by what they say . </s>
in Austria 's case , the statement be contradictory to say the least . </s>
on the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remark by the leader of the Freedom Party . </s>
on the other hand , the new Austrian Government 's programme reaffirm its commitment to defend democracy and human right . </s>
we will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two face of the Freedom Party be the real one . </s>
I be refer to the position the Austrian government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission 's proposal for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directive . </s>
one apply to the principle of treat people equally , without differentiate on the ground of race or ethnic origin . </s>
the other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the ground of ethnic or racial origin , religion , handicap or sexual persuasion . </s>
these be significant text , adopt in accordance with Article @card@ of the Treaty , which give the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the ground of race , ethnic origin , sex etc . </s>
lastly , I would like to assure you , Mr Ford , that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibility , should it prove necessary . </s>
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question . </s>
but be Commissioner Vitorino aware , not only of Mr Haider 's and the Freedom Party 's word , but also of their deed ? </s>
Mr Haider have actually be in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he have lead a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who be Austrian citizen , where he have attempt to abolish dual language education and where there have be clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant community . </s>
Could the Commissioner answer two question . </s>
firstly he talk about verification . </s>
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ? </s>
secondly , do he not agree that be the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policy that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursue at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human right and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action ? </s>
we be not talk about word here . </s>
we be talk about deed by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider . </s>
it be quite clear to me that it be the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States accord to the procedure and standard that be enshrine in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty . </s>
therefore I be fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria , as in any other Member State . </s>
if any concrete case of persistent violation of human right perpetrate by the government of one Member State occur , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly . </s>
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the member of the European Parliament , but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisation , which have always make an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission . </s>
regard the situation in Carinthia , we need to look at this in detail . </s>
the honourable Member raise the question . </s>
the protection of ethnic minority and of minority that speak a specific language be an element of the programme and of the two directive that the Commission have put before the Council . </s>
we should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question . </s>
that question call for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action . </s>
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directive that the Commission have present to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete term their approval for the action plan and for the directive and their commitment to fight against discrimination , racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur . </s>
thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this Question Time . </s>
second part question to Mrs Wallström Question no @card@ by ( H-0021 / @card@ ) : subject : surplus electrical and electronic equipment each year the European Union have to deal with a grow volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment ( 6 million tonne ' worth in @card@ ) , mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment become obsolescent . </s>
the environmental problem stem from the incineration and the dump of such waste be mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substance ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chrome , PVC and halogenate flame retarder ) . </s>
a preliminary draft directive intend to regulate the management of such waste have be through three successive version , the most recent of which date from July @card@ . </s>
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerge in its final form in @card@ ? </s>
be it true that the US Government be dispute most of the provision of the current draft and be even threaten to appeal to the World Trade Organisation ( for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2 ( 2 ) of the agreement on technical obstacle to trade ) if it be adopt ? </s>
the Commission agree with MEPs that the current method of dump electrical and electronic waste be cause major environmental problem . </s>
consequently , the Commission decide to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since @card@ , have be involve in discussion with the party concern . </s>
the outcome of the discussion , as well as of the in-depth investigation which be be carry out in this area , be now be examine by the Commission . </s>
some part of the proposal have be criticise , among them the phase out of some heavy metal and brominate flame retardant , as well as the application of the principle of make manufacturer responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste . </s>
the United States ' delegation to the European Union be concern about certain point in the last consultation paper , inter alia the phase out of the material already mention , as well as certain question arise from the principle of manufacturer ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste . </s>
the main argument put forward by the United States in this context be that the present provision be , they say , incompatible with international trade law . </s>
the Commission be currently carefully review the United States ' argument . </s>
I should just like to add that my intention be that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dump of electrical and electronic waste before Easter . </s>
my question specifically concern the reaction of the US government to the text of the preliminary draft . </s>
There have in fact be three preliminary draft text with the last one , to my knowledge , date from July @card@ . </s>
be this the text which you will be submit , or an amendment to the original version ? </s>
version 3 be already much weak than Version 2 follow the comment of US industry as relay by the US Government . </s>
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you be refer in fact to the rule of the World Trade Organisation . </s>
the argument of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substance in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rule . </s>
this worry me because this means that , when adopt text , we be go to be continually threaten by attack from the World Trade Organisation . </s>
this will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal . </s>
thank you for the follow-up question . </s>
it be important for me to have a chance to answer it . </s>
it be clear that in a process such as this , where we be discuss the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe , there be an on-going dialogue between the different party concern . </s>
the dialogue have be fruitful and have lead to our prepare a proposal . </s>
part of it have be strengthen , but other part may well contain too many compromise . </s>
we be still in the process of prepare a text , and the dialogue with the relevant party will continue up until the last moment . </s>
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our take insufficient account of environmental consideration . </s>
I strongly oppose use the WTO and trade rule as a pretext for prevent the Eu from introduce radical environmental standard . </s>
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these . </s>
however , I do want to listen to all the point of view . </s>
for example , I recently meet representative of the electronics industry who put forward suggestion - include practical one - for improve our own proposal . </s>
however , I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive . </s>
in fact , I believe that we should be show the way , an intention that will also characterise the final proposal . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0026 / @card@ ) : subject : gender and environment practically all the contributor involve in the Rio and Kyoto process - individual organisation , civic action group , government , the World Bank , the UN and relief organisation - believe that woman should take a great part in decision-making on the environment . </s>
more woman in decision-making position on various environmental body would extend the predominantly male term of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well . </s>
be the Commission prepare to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of woman in decision-making in the environmental field ? </s>
in @card@ , the Commission introduce an action plan to promote equal opportunity for woman and man . </s>
through the current programme , which cover the period @card@ to @card@ , we be endeavour to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both man and woman be integrate and where gender-specific need be take into consideration . </s>
One of the programme 's aim be to develop and supervise method , strategy and measure for promote gender equality in the decision-making process and in position of responsibility . </s>
within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general be to prepare its own programme of measure . </s>
One of the goal of those programme be to increase the number of woman in managerial position . </s>
the new Commission 's own objective be to double the number of woman manager before the end of its term of office . </s>
the same line be be pursue with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment , where nearly @card@ per cent of director and @card@ per cent of unit head be woman . </s>
our policy be to encourage the recruitment of woman to administrative post in order to create a reserve of suitable candidate for future promotion to managerial position . </s>
currently , woman hold @card@ per cent of our A-grade post , and we hope the number will increase steadily . </s>
moreover , we be try hard to attract qualified woman to participate in our consultation group . </s>
as regard our external partner , all we can do be set them a good example and encourage their effort to democratise their decision-making process . </s>
with respect to the general principle of incorporate a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle be include in the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
article 3 of the Treaty state that , in all the activity refer to in this Article , the Community shall aim to eliminate inequality , and to promote equality , between woman and man . </s>
the Commission give its full support to the effort be make in this area and be continue its investigation into whether specific measure can be implement in the environmental field . </s>
I should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role play by the European Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , particularly its chair . </s>
I should just like to recall that , during the lengthy process of approve the present Commission , every Commissioner be question by the Women 's Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field . </s>
we shall be monitor each Commissioner carefully , so the other commissioner have now be forewarn . </s>
thank you for your reply . </s>
I interpret it as say that you agree that what be need be an action plan to enable more woman to take part in specific environmental field . </s>
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasise the importance of have the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programme . </s>
environmental agency often do not have the require knowledge or procedure for incorporate such a perspective into their daily work . </s>
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner be willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programme . </s>
this be a crucial goal . </s>
in order for all policy to be similarly permeate by the concept of equality , it be especially important that people in key post should have the basic knowledge require . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) my understanding of mainstreaming be , of course , that this should characterise everything we do . </s>
in the action plan prepare by my Directorate-General , issue of equality play a very important role . </s>
for example , I be prepare to give seminar on leadership or other subject myself to encourage woman to take on further task within the Commission . </s>
if we be to be able to motivate everybody , I believe it be extremely important for this message to be send all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up . </s>
my impression of environment-related work , broadly speak , be that in many instance it be dominate by woman . </s>
this state of affair must be encourage so that woman have a chance to secure managerial post or reach high-ranking position in the environmental field . </s>
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflect that intention , but there be certainly room for improvement . </s>
I have some experience in draw up plan and follow them up . </s>
I hope that this will be of benefit . </s>

the harbour construction project be receive support from the structural fund and chiefly involve dredge the river Boyne Estuary and deposit the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan . </s>
the Boyne Estuary be designate a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive . </s>
that mean that any development that take place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that be likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criterion for the area lay down in the Community 's Habitats Directive . </s>
since @card@ , the Commission have receive a number of complaint allege that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan , which be now designate a part of the special protection area , and that the relevant protection criterion have not be observe . </s>
after investigate these complaint between @card@ and the beginning of @card@ - during which time the project do not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission become convince , in the summer of @card@ , that the relevant protection criterion have be observe during the building of the harbour . </s>
an in-depth environmental impact assessment have be carry out . </s>
the most serious harm cause by the project , the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats , be only to be temporary , and the developer be liable for completely restore the mudflats . </s>
at the Commission 's suggestion , the mudflats at Stegrennan be formally include in the Boyne Estuary special protection area , from which they have previously be exclude . </s>
furthermore , to compensate for the negative effect on the bird population cause by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention be that other habitat in the estuary should be improve . </s>
however , since last summer the measure just mention have be in dispute . </s>
firstly , the Irish authority withdraw their early commitment to carry out improvement . </s>
they then renew their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation begin a legal challenge in the Irish court . </s>
however , the new commitment include some minor change which , in turn , lead to a further complaint . </s>
in view of the fact that the Irish authority have undertake to make compensatory improvement and that other issue have already be resolve , the Commission will not , for the present , propose that financial support from the structural fund should be suspend . </s>
however , it wish to discuss the question of compensatory measure with respect to improve habitat with the Irish authority , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish court . </s>
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner say . </s>
the mudflat at Stregrennan , which be make a special protection area at the request of the Commission , have be completely destroy at this stage . </s>
it be clear that the activity that have take place there be in clear breach of Eu directive . </s>
you say there will be no further funding . </s>
I would like to know whether you be go to stop completely the funding at this stage until there be a proper investigation . </s>
if not , why not ? </s>
if you be , when exactly be you go to do it ? </s>
be it correct and proper that the department which own the company be also the authority which issue the licence , and also the authority which basically take the money from the Eu and give it to a company that it own @card@ % ? </s>
be this right and proper ? </s>
What be your opinion on that ? </s>
any Eu funding for the project must be stop because it be in clear breach of Eu directive . </s>
even the area designate by the commissioner as a special protection area have be destroy . </s>
compensation afterwards be not go to make up for the damage that be do . </s>
the first legal challenge follow the start of work on the port of development in early autumn @card@ without the compensatory habitat improvement be in place . </s>
as a result , the Irish authority agree to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical mean . </s>
the use of mechanical mean lead to a further legal challenge - that be what I refer to also in my first answer - base on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlie mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary . </s>
There be to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge . </s>
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measure be a matter for the national authority , and do not require prior Commission approval . </s>
the Commission 's role be to make sure that the standard require by the Birds Directive be fully meet , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measure which be themselves damaging . </s>
in this case , the Commission propose to seek further clarification from the Irish authority on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measure and possible problem with the mechanical removal of cord grass . </s>
we be not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the structural fund . </s>
Mr President , sadly , the specific case raise by Mrs McKenna be not an isolated one . </s>
There be other example of conservation in special scientific area be damage as a result of Eu funding . </s>
Will the Commission consider issue instruction to all Member States say that , if in future it discover that European environmental directive have be breach or proper environmental assessment have not be carry out , it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already grant , in other word , reclaim the money from the Member States ? </s>
it be only such action which will discourage this practice in the future . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) this be a very important question . </s>
as MEPs be well aware , in the course of last year a joint text be issue by our predecessor in the Commission , Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concern the relationship between the structural fund , money from the structural fund and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives . </s>
the message contain in the joint text be still valid . </s>
we can hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take country to court , where they may well be fine . </s>
it be therefore important that there be a coordination strategy . </s>
the result may , of course , be some difficult question of priority . </s>
in my view , the most important consequence , however , be that country should do some careful thinking and , above all , make sure they send in their list of Natura @card@ site . </s>
then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedure . </s>
in that respect , Ireland fall short , like other Member States , but we hope that the pressure we be exert will produce result . </s>
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still hold good . </s>
the Rules of Procedure do not allow this . </s>
you will have to discuss this outside the Chamber . </s>
question to Mr Barnier - Question No @card@ by ( H-0020 / @card@ ) : subject : partnership arrangement and the third community support framework for Greece the recent regulation ( EC ) @card@ / @card@ lay down general provision on the Structural Funds place great emphasis than the previous regulation on strong partnership , involve the regional and local authority and other public body , the economic and social partner and all other relevant body not only in the preparation but also in the funding , monitoring and assessment of the measure take . </s>
however , local authority have repeatedly express the view that ' partnership ' arrangement under the new CSF for Greece have remain unchanged and be singularly lack in substance . </s>
have the Greek government introduce any change so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangement to the local authority and other representative body ? </s>
in what way have the local authority be give a great say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what step will the Commission take to ensure great participation by the ' partner ' in all measure take under the new CSF ? </s>
May I quickly add something to the answer give just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin ? </s>
this be a joint letter between our two predecessor and I consider , as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies , that this letter be still valid . </s>
I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the project finance by the structural fund with the Eu environmental directive and policy . </s>
I be also say this as a former environment minister . </s>
turn now to the question pose by Mr Alavanos , who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the Commission have be monitor and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle . </s>
the involvement of regional and local authority in the Community 's action be , as you know , one of the essential element of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation . </s>
with regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece , the Commission have note that the public authority be largely involve during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the @card@ period . </s>
Mr Alavanos know that I have be to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstance of the earthquake disaster . </s>
during these visit , I hold discussion with the Greek government and raise this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement . </s>
as for subsequent phase , in other word the preparation of national and regional programme , it be not enough for this objective to be take into account at national and theoretical level . </s>
it must also be specifically include in the programme establish the CSF at national , regional and local level . </s>
as for the monitoring and management of these programme , I have not yet receive the national provision propose by the Greek government pursuant to Article 8 of the new regulation . </s>
in the current negotiation on this third Community support framework , I have ask for the provision on the partnership principle to be fully respect , with regard to both regional and local authority and to non-governmental organisation and association . </s>
within the third CSF , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partner in the monitoring committee . </s>
this be all I can say . </s>
I thank the Commissioner , and do not at all question his intention and intervention , which adopt a positive line . </s>
however , thing be really quite different . </s>
the operation of the Community Support Framework be rule by a centralise hand and indeed at this time we be experience state , government and party delirium as regard the European Union 's funding . </s>
I can show you the television programme here but I can show you the Greek newspaper from a few week before the election . </s>
in the Sunday paper all over Greece : the Ministry of Public Works concern the structural fund : the Minister 's work ; the Ministry of Agriculture : the Minister 's work - just a few week before the election - the Ministry of Telecommunications : the work of the Minister for Telecommunications ; the Ministry of Education : the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister ; the Ministry of Employment : the work of the Minister for Employment , a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary , and behind them all the symbol of the Community Support Framework . </s>
There be only a few week to go before the election . </s>
this be both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidate , finance by the European Union , the CSF . </s>
my question to the Commissioner be this : what be to be do ? </s>
Will the Commission remain silent ? </s>
Will it discuss the matter ? </s>
Will it bring it up with the Greek government or will we persist with the pathological situation we have with the previous Commission ? </s>
Mr Alavanos , I see that you have throw to your leave all the document which you have just cite . </s>
Would you let me have these document so that I can read them , after I have have them translate ? </s>
I can then determine what they contain in term of information and communication , which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy , and what be propaganda . </s>
then if it be really necessary for me to do this , I will make comment or recommendation to the Greek government . </s>
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these document or I will come and get them from you later on . </s>
have say that , I think your question relate more to the partnership issue . </s>
further to your question on the pre-electoral period , I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authority should be involve together with non-governmental organisation . </s>
I can only quote what be contain in the general structural fund regulation which specify that the Commission will work with the government of the Member States . </s>
it be therefore the Greek government which be my primary partner . </s>
subsequently , if I need to ensure that this partnership be disseminate and decentralise , then I will do this . </s>
I can do other than work with the Greek government . </s>
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be give all these particular to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really be propaganda and not just some way of promote Community programme . </s>
however , turn to the substance , I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the follow : that for all national and regional programme , Greece be regard as a region which express itself - at the level of its partnership relation with the European Union - via its central administration , its central government . </s>
from that point of view , neither local government and much less non-governmental organisation , for example the farming cooperative which would be interested in further development of the farming sector , have any involvement in the formulation of proposal for the third Community Support Framework , nor have they have any involvement in the previous CSF . </s>
What can the Commission do about that ? </s>
Mr Theonas , I can only repeat what I say to Mr Alavanos . </s>
I will monitor this situation very closely . </s>
if necessary , within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation , I will make comment on the use make , not of structural fund which be not yet commit , but of the negotiation prior to the allocation of these structural fund . </s>
however , I be oblige to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiation . </s>
have say this , I will look at the situation objectively . </s>
as for the rest , if you have any recommendation or suggestion on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you speak of a cooperative structure - I be ready and willing , on the basis of suggestion from MEPs - you will be act within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestion , provide that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation . </s>
why would I not say that we have notice in previous year , on the part of the Greek government , some shortcoming in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation in term of involve representative of civil society ? </s>
I be say this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming be note , this must be remedy . </s>
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework . </s>
- question no @card@ by ( H-0041 / @card@ ) : subject : structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period , @card@ , no assistance be grant to research in the nuclear fusion or fission area ? </s>
Can it also undertake to rule out any measure provide financing for research of this type during the negotiation in progress with the Member States on the plan and programme for the new @card@ period ? </s>
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ? </s>
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relate to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy source ? </s>
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission network ? </s>
on Mrs Isler Béguin 's first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacity of the region in order to increase their competitiveness be one of the Community 's priority during the previous programming period . </s>
the support allocate by the structural fund for technological cohesion , or research and technical development , within the Community support framework for that period be estimate at approximately EUR @card@ billion . </s>
this be about 6 % of the whole Community contribution . </s>
with regard to your specific concern , I can say that , as in the previous period , the Commission do not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission . </s>
however , it be still the responsibility of the Member States ' management authority to select the project to be implement within these CSF . </s>
consequently , even though this be not a Community priority , a Member State can decide to finance research and development project in the civil nuclear technology area , provide that these project contribute to regional development . </s>
the Commission do not have to be systematically inform of these . </s>
on your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , be of great interest to me , the Commission 's approach be give in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds . </s>
these fund specify that investment in the renewable energy sector must be encourage where they favour the development of local resource , where they contribute to reduce dependency on energy import and where they create job at local level . </s>
I be able to verify this , for example , during a visit I make to the Azore in Portugal a few day ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy . </s>
the Structural Funds contribution which have enable great penetration of the renewable energy market be also underline in the campaign to promote renewable energy source launch by the Transport and Energy Department . </s>
finally , on large-scale energy transmission network , the guideline also provide for financial participation from the fund to develop these network where this help to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effect of isolation . </s>
this be particularly valid for the region of the Azore which I have just mention and also for all most remote region . </s>
it be also valid for certain region handicap by their isolation due to mountain , for example . </s>
Commissioner , thank you for your answer . </s>
however , I ask this question because we be rightly concern that the report on the third framework programme for research contain a project entitle ' International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ' . </s>
this project amount to several billion ecus and area eligible for structural fund , such as those list in Objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation . </s>
we would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in term of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific ' nuclear research ' context . </s>
you do not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission network . </s>
Could you please give an answer on this issue ? </s>
you be concern about whether the structural fund will be use to finance the installation of nuclear plant anywhere . </s>
quite simply there be no question of this . </s>
I say that the selection of project remain the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation . </s>
as a result , the Commission service be not systematically inform of all project select . </s>
however , you be right to question me as this be your task , as mine be to answer you . </s>
as have happen in the past , the Member States be require to provide answer when the Commission question them or ask for clarification . </s>
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually share between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what be happen on this specific point . </s>
the Member State or States concerned will then be require to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible . </s>
I think I have answer your question on large-scale energy transmission network . </s>
the energy situation vary widely from region to region in the European Union . </s>
assistance from the structural fund could be justify in certain case and for certain region , particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy network be still underdeveloped . </s>
this be the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission network and the structural fund . </s>
- question no @card@ by ( H-0052 / @card@ ) : subject : structural fund and additionality in the light of the Commission 's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality , I wish to ask whether the Commission have any plan to seek amendment of the rule concern additionality . </s>
in particular , would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rule to ensure that additionality operate not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States , with regard to budgetary provision between central government and internally autonomous region or country ? </s>
Mr MacCormick , the Commission have no plan to amend the rule concern additionality which be stipulate , for the @card@ period , in Article @card@ of the general regulation on the fund . </s>
as in the past , these rule state that the additionality principle apply to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State . </s>
in this respect , it must be stress that it be the expenditure finance by the structural fund which must be additional . </s>
the cofinancing provide by the Member State do not need to be additional to its existing expenditure . </s>
provide that the Member State do not reduce all its own expenditure , the structural fund be add to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality be therefore respect . </s>
as for the budgetary provision within the Member States , between central government and internal autonomous region or country , these be determine accord to exclusively national consideration and be therefore not affect by additionality within the meaning define in the rule . </s>
Please excuse this very legal answer . </s>
however , after verification it be precisely in this legal manner and specifically accord to the post-Berlin Structural Funds regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle . </s>
- I be grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappoint by its content . </s>
we be leave with Article @card@ ( 1 ) which say that the appropriation of the fund may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States . </s>
very well : that be to be the unchanging rule . </s>
do section @card@ ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the follow practice . </s>
when an autonomous region 's or country 's funding from European structural fund increase , the state make a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region , so that the total funding package available match a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural fund grant by the Union . </s>
be that really authorise ? </s>
unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue . </s>
if Mr MacCormick would be satisfy with my partial agreement with his reasoning , I will give him a full answer in write by restate the legal base of both Article @card@ in general and Article @card@ ( 1 ) in particular . </s>
I be aware of the Member 's competence on these matter . </s>
I also know the particular problem in your constituency in Scotland where dispute and discussion be occur on these subject . </s>
however , on a general level , I would say that in all case it be the structural fund expenditure which must be additional . </s>
this be how , provide that the Member State do not reduce all its own expenditure , the structural fund can be add to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle be respect . </s>
I will go further in the written answer which I have promise in order to set thing out more objectively and precisely . </s>
- Additionality be a major issue too in Wales , which I represent . </s>
just last week it be one of the issue that bring about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales . </s>
as recently as @card@ and @card@ the Commission win a battle with the UK over additionality , at that time link to the RECHAR funding . </s>
this lead to an agreement be sign whereby the UK Government agree to introduce procedure to ensure that Eu spending reach the area for which be be intend and be actually additional . </s>
and yet we still have these problem in Wales and in Scotland . </s>
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that be sign with the UK Government ? </s>
I take this to mean that the debate of which I be aware in Scotland be also occur in Wales . </s>
I will verify this point and , if you wish , I will give you a write answer at the same time as the one I have promise to Mr MacCormick . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0088 / @card@ ) : subject : amount which Andalusia will receive from the structural fund for the @card@ period accord to the Commission 's estimate and on the basis of the criterion establish at the Berlin Summit ( which include per capita GDP , the unemployment rate and the population census update in accordance with the @card@ register of inhabitant ) , what amount be to be allocate to Andalusia from the structural fund for the @card@ period ? </s>
question to Mr Bolkestein Mr President , I will try to be brief in answer the Member 's question . </s>
the regional development plan submit by the Spanish authority on @card@ October do not indicate how the Community fund will be allocate among the Spanish Objective 1 region and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive . </s>
as I do not fully understand the plan , I contact the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs , Mr Rato , in a letter of @card@ December which I have here , to ask him for more information on the document submit . </s>
in the come week , the Commission will start negotiation with the Spanish authority with a view to draw up the Community support framework for the new period of @card@ . </s>
during these meeting I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarification require on the regional allocation . </s>
therefore , if you wish , as soon as I have this information by sector and region , I will personally send you the information on Andalusia . </s>
Mr Commissioner , the problem be that when Mr Aznar come to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia , he count all of them , but when he go to the Andalusia Council to pay for service , he fail to notice @card@ @card@ Andalusians , and this be very serious , because @card@ @card@ child be the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city large than Granada , full of child . </s>
this question be very important and I would like to know - since this be a kind of ' baby fraud ' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these fund be not take away from the Andalusians , so that the fund which the European Union be go to pay to Andalusia , base on the census , will take into account these @card@ @card@ child which Aznar do not count when it come to provide them with school and service . </s>
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matter . </s>
I know that these be very important issue in Spain and there be differ viewpoint . </s>
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar be the President of the Spanish government . </s>
you may answer the question . </s>
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I hear that you have a strong voice . </s>
I hope it be loud enough to be hear in Madrid for I realise that what you have say be not strictly intend for me . </s>
I have give you my answer . </s>
I be keen that the structural fund , particularly those in Objective 1 , be allocate where need . </s>
we have criterion which be apply and we know roughly what each of the region of Europe should or could receive . </s>
I can only say that I must discuss these matter with the national authority and government of each country . </s>
I be not avoid the issue but I must abide by the general regulation . </s>
it be the responsibility of these authority and government to allocate the fund as objectively and fairly as possible . </s>
I need to know about this allocation , however , and this be why I say that I could not answer today . </s>
as I do not have an answer , I write to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on @card@ December . </s>
I be about to lose patience at not have receive an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it . </s>
I regret that the Commissioner have once again become involve in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention . </s>
I would like to remind all of you that Spain be about to hold election , and in fact there be just @card@ day leave before the election . </s>
it should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these election will take place in @card@ day time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again . </s>
I do believe it be important to say that Andalusia be go to receive @card@ % more within the Community support framework and that Spain also hold the record for the use of the Structural Funds , which mean that the distribution be base strictly on the implement regulation and be decentralise by mean of the regional development plan and different Community support framework . </s>
lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question : do you consider it necessary to change the implement regulation for the structural fund or do you consider the current distribution criterion to be acceptable ? </s>
this be a fascinating debate which I realise be not totally Community-related . </s>
have say this , we must accept that election be always take place in the country of the European Union . </s>
I be please that the structural fund be the subject of discussion in Greece and Spain . </s>
we be talk a short while ago in this house about debate involve our citizen , about public debate . </s>
the more we talk about Europe and what Europe be do for daily life , even when we disagree , the good this will be , provide that we talk about this objectively . </s>
I be not go to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation . </s>
this regulation be adopt just last year in Berlin and I will be apply it for the next seven year . </s>
we will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for make an assessment with and before this House and for outline future prospect . </s>
the time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendment to be highlight . </s>
for the time be , please let me apply the regulation which have not yet be apply as it be only approve in Berlin . </s>
this be all I can say today . </s>
thank you very much for your reply , Mr Barnier . </s>
question Nos @card@ to @card@ will be reply to in writing . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0049 / @card@ ) : subject : new premise for the OHIM at present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market ( OHIM ) be still operate from the same temporary premise , even though its new building be open in June @card@ . </s>
in view of this unusual situation , will the Commission say why the OHIM have not yet move to its new premise ? </s>
the honourable Member ask a question on this topic in November @card@ and I would like to refer him to the answer give at the time . </s>
furthermore , I have ask the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market , that be to say the Office in Alicante , to comment further on this new question and I can , as a result , inform the honourable Member as follow , on behalf of the Office : the office be not yet ready to move into the new building . </s>
unfortunately , a number of deadline have be exceed . </s>
a number of technical provision need to be make , such as the installation of a computer network , archives , a canteen and furniture . </s>
the OHIM be now in the process of arrange this and be expect to move into the new premise by June . </s>
during the previous question , we be discuss electoral issue . </s>
I believe that this issue be relevant to my question . </s>
commissioner , you be not present at the extraordinarily name ' official opening ' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June , in the middle of an election campaign in Spain lead up to both the European election and the local and regional election . </s>
if you have be there , I be sure you would have be ashamed . </s>
the President of the Commission and some secretary be present . </s>
in the middle of an election campaign , a series of authority , all of them run by the party in government , make clearly electioneer speech which , furthermore , be broadcast live on television . </s>
it be bizarre to see the President of the region of Valencia praise the work of the Spanish government , as well as his own work , although it be irrelevant to that event . </s>
the opening of a building which be not finish , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight month after the opening can still not be occupy , make the Spanish government look ridiculous . </s>
I be not worry that the Spanish government should look foolish , because at the end of the day it be their responsibility , but it do worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorse , through its presence , this absurd event . </s>
I would therefore like to ask you , Mr Commissioner : do it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be open during an election campaign ? </s>
do it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organise by the Spanish government ? </s>
it do not fall within my remit to make statement about internal political situation within one Member State or another . </s>
as such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer have just describe . </s>
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony be hold in Spain . </s>
What I can say be that I hope that this building will now be occupy as soon as possible . </s>
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference . </s>
I hope that this building will then be occupy . </s>
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it be not an electoral question . </s>
as member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , we have follow the creation of that institution and it be clear that it be establish for electioneer reason . </s>
a year later , it be still not function , which mean that the Commission spend money on a false opening . </s>
we should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of fund be justify . </s>
I would like to reiterate that the Commission be unconcerned with the underlie motivation of Member State action . </s>
it be , however , interested in official statement and action . </s>
we do not intend to go in the direction of what be term in French un procès d 'intention . </s>
we be concern with public official action and event , rather than any possible underlie motivation . </s>
this be why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question . </s>
once again , the Commission do not speculate why something be happen earlier or later than plan . </s>
it only appreciate that a building for this Office be open and occupy as soon as possible . </s>
also , the Commission do not engage itself in find out whether certain expenditure be real or virtual . </s>
as far as I be concern , all expenditure be real . </s>
and any remain skeleton , I intend to leave them in the cupboard . </s>

question no @card@ by ( H-0117 / @card@ ) : subject : alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action do the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently be plan by Sweden , and the associate import restriction , and to ensure that the rule of the single market be apply ? </s>
I would like to answer these two question as follow . </s>
when Sweden join the European Union , it be allow to retain quantitative restriction on alcoholic beverage which traveller can bring into the country from other Member States . </s>
this derogation from the principle of the free movement of good lapse on @card@ June of this year . </s>
Sweden now want to extend this measure by another five year , as this would be necessary to protect public health . </s>
my position on this be clear . </s>
Sweden have now have sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policy to a situation where such import restriction do not exist . </s>
I can see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be propose . </s>
European citizen have the right to buy good for their own use , include taxis , in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without have to subject these good to control and without possibly have to pay another set of taxis on them . </s>
that be a basic principle govern the internal market and derogation from this principle must be exception and must be limit in time . </s>
we want to guarantee that Swedish citizen too can enjoy the benefit of the internal market , just like other citizen of the European Union . </s>
this certainly do not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surround the possible health problem which can be cause by alcohol abuse . </s>
a recent study , carry out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund , however , have show that abolish the restriction would not lead to a high alcohol consumption in Sweden . </s>
I have already have a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm , the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasion . </s>
I also discuss this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week . </s>
it be now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measure . </s>
thank you for your reply . </s>
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission . </s>
instead of @card@ , it should , of course , be 1 July @card@ . </s>
I have some sympathy with the Commission 's standpoint that derogation should only be grant occasionally . </s>
such a rule be only normal . </s>
nevertheless , I should like to ask two question : be you think of embark upon continued discussion with the Swedish government about extend the derogation , for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogation ? </s>
my second question concern the whole policy on alcohol . </s>
this may , of course , be see as an issue concern the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole Eu . </s>
What be the respective role of alcohol policy and public health consideration in the Commission 's work ? </s>
a Europe-wide policy on alcohol be not just an issue concern the internal market . </s>
it also have important implication for public health . </s>
if we have consider these aspect in their overall context , then it might have be easy to carry on a dialogue with Sweden . </s>
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follow ? </s>
firstly , Finland and Denmark be subject to exemption to the basic rule of the free movement of good until @card@ . </s>
these country be in the process of take measure in preparation of free access of alcoholic product in the year @card@ . </s>
however , in the case of Sweden , the situation be different . </s>
in @card@ , a five-year derogation period be decide upon , which be now lapse . </s>
I have as yet not hear any argument on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period . </s>
secondly , the Swedish government be be consult all the way . </s>
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday , 6 March , in order to talk to Minister Ringholm , to member of the Swedish parliament , and , if necessary , also to the Prime Minister or other minister , in order to continue discussion on this matter . </s>
I be fully aware that emotion be run high in the political arena in Sweden regard this issue . </s>
thirdly , I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter be naturally important . </s>
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University have state , namely that whatever happen in term of import restriction , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same . </s>
the question be then , of course , where do the volume of alcohol originate from which be not import by traveller ? </s>
the answer be that this be smuggle into the country or make by the Swede themselves , and as Mr Andersson know , this be an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity . </s>
well now , Mr Andersson seem to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol . </s>
but in that case , not only Sweden , but all Eu country , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol . </s>
we can cast our mind back to a similar situation in the United States . </s>
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what be term then ' prohibition ' . </s>
he will also be aware of the effect the ban have on Mafia activity within the United States , where , eventually , prohibition be withdraw . </s>
All this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by ban alcohol , because that do not work . </s>
Mr President , the question at issue be the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish government say that it must cover health cost , then this be proof of a distortion of competition because other country must cover their health cost themselves , with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal . </s>
my question refer to whether you too know of study which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer be good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget . </s>
I gather that Mr Posselt have hint at the fiscal aspect of this matter . </s>
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol product in Sweden go back to the year @card@ and that since then , the sale of alcohol product have account for a significant portion of the state 's tax revenue . </s>
as be know , this have lead to a state monopoly in Sweden which , in itself , be at odd with Union legislation . </s>
as to the healing effect of alcohol - to which , I believe , Mr Posselt also make reference - I could not agree more with him : I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and be also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps Mr Posselt , Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these day to share an aquavit . </s>
Mr President , I listen with interest to the Commissioner 's reply about the need to apply the law of the single market . </s>
I wonder whether he can say whether he consider his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France 's Loi et Vin , which effectively prevent single market rule apply to the sale of alcohol product in France ? </s>
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice ? </s>
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raise by the honourable Member , since this matter be now under active consideration by the Commission . </s>
the Commission have to take a decision on whether the matter be close or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice . </s>
my reply be perhaps not satisfactory right now , but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of week . </s>
I ask for the Member 's understanding for this small delay in the Commission 's decision . </s>
Commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health ground , for a difference in the taxation rate on , for example , Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague 's Bavarian beer ? </s>
Can you envisage apply an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe ? </s>
the matter of excise taxis , to which the honourable Member be refer , be the prerogative of the Member State concern . </s>
the Commission have no instrument to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxis on alcoholic product or on any other product . </s>
towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the difference in excise taxis between Member States . </s>
it will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affair , which indicate that there be quite a lot of difference in excise rate between Member States . </s>
for example - I believe the honourable Member refer to this - no excise taxis be apply on wine in France , whereas they be apply in the United Kingdom . </s>
that lead to a distortion of the internal market because wine be smuggle from France to the United Kingdom . </s>
the question specifically refer to the relation between excise taxis and the alcohol content of the good subject to excise tax . </s>
the Commission have no means of influence here . </s>
in the case of Sweden , the instrument of excise taxis be indeed use to reduce the consumption of alcohol . </s>
although this lead to a disparity in excise taxis between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increase cross-border smuggling of alcoholic product - it be a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol . </s>
There be , of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand . </s>
I be not sure exactly what it be , but it be not zero , therefore it must have some effect . </s>
my question would have be almost exactly the one raise by Mr Purvis , but I would like to press the point further . </s>
grant , as you say , that excise duty lie within the prerogative of Member States , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which be unfairly discriminatory against producer in one part of the Community versus other might still conflict with the single market principle . </s>
for example , if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be think of , the malt whisky produce part of the Highland - a very peripheral part of Europe , very hard-pressed , a whole farming community as well as a distil community dependent upon it - a general practice of tax the alcohol in Scotch whisky , Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seem to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which be admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States . </s>
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other member of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxis differ between Member States be indeed something which be not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market . </s>
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic product . </s>
if one look at petrol , for example , one see that excise taxis in Germany be different from those of Holland , and consequently Dutch motorist cross the border and fill up their tank in Germany . </s>
that be indeed distortion of the internal market . </s>
if I have my way , I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxis across Europe . </s>
as a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if product be intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another . </s>
but I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way . </s>
this be an area of unanimity , as Mr MacCormick know , and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxis , it will not happen . </s>
once again , towards the end of this year , the Commission will forward a report on the state of affair on excise taxis , and I be obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner . </s>
today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax be put on it , but I suppose it be a lot . </s>
since the time allot to question to the Commission have elapse , Questions @card@ to @card@ will be reply to in writing . </s>
that conclude question to the Commission . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at @card@ p. m. ) Community policy in the field of water ( continuation ) the next item be the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy . </s>
Mr President , the situation regard fresh water in Europe be not as serious as in other part of the world but , in general term , it be a fact that the demand for water have continue to grow and its quality have continue to decrease . </s>
To this we must add the water pollution problem which afflict the potential new Member States in the East . </s>
in fact , a reservoir contain cyanide have just burst its bank in Romania , threaten aquifer which supply the population of Yugoslavia . </s>
I understand that Mrs Wallström , whose presence here tonight I appreciate , be go to visit the area . </s>
I believe that no country , no government and , of course , no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measure for each river basin . </s>
the development of this directive have be difficult and complex , involve diverse interest and divide opinion . </s>
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , Mrs Lienemann , have make great effort and show great dedication in reconcile position , and have succeed to a large extent . </s>
however , it be almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situation and expectation . </s>
I come from a country whose southern half be on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depend on the whim of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain . </s>
the Mediterranean region have have to fight for its development by try to overcome this adversity , century after century , year after year , day after day , and be still do so today . </s>
therefore , it seem essential to us that the directive comply , in practice , with the obligation lay down in article @card@ of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its region . </s>
in accordance with this principle , the Spanish delegation of the European People 's Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 ( Recital @card@ ) , @card@ and @card@ ( Article @card@ ( d ) ) , since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States , that be , the regulation of water resource . </s>
it would be very difficult for the Community to determine the condition for the regulation of water in the different region , give the different internal balance which be always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different area and the relevant interest . </s>
we also reject the amendment which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for @card@ . </s>
we must clearly set water price which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the produce industry in the less-favoured region and do not hinder their legitimate development . </s>
I would lastly like to refer to the amendment on dangerous substance which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution . </s>
in no field of human activity have we ever discover a zero degree of pollution . </s>
we will be do a general disservice to the objective of this important directive if we be not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provision . </s>
I hope that , once again , this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity , seek a suitable balance between the environmental objective and economic and social consideration , the three essential element in achieve the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , this be a very important directive . </s>
its aim be to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage system . </s>
the public must have a right to clean water . </s>
it be important not only for the environment but also for public health . </s>
I be not speak so much for myself , as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home . </s>
we must make sure that we get start quickly with the programme to improve water quality . </s>
action must get under way immediately . </s>
we can afford to waste time . </s>
it be important that the timetable be an ambitious one . </s>
in my opinion , the timetable be not too ambitious if we believe that by @card@ we will no longer allow impurity in water and we aim at zero level quantity of impurity and toxic matter by then . </s>
it be a question of do what be technically possible ; obviously it be not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious . </s>
I would like to comment on one issue , which be speak about earlier . </s>
I believe the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy have restrict too tightly the debate on the transfer of water . </s>
this be not merely a problem for Spain ; it be one for the Nordic country , and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solution in these matter , when they be well for the environment and the economy than what be propose in the directive . </s>
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , congratulations , Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work . </s>
water and air surround us everywhere . </s>
we share them with everyone on this earth . </s>
water be a prerequisite for human life . </s>
and there be more and more of us in the world . </s>
Mrs Schleicher intimate early today that clean water be an unrealistic goal . </s>
nothing could be further from the truth ! </s>
it be unrealistic to go on cause the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the condition for life . </s>
it be especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which be most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resource . </s>
I would therefore appeal to member of Parliament to appreciate that tough demand for a clean environment be a sign of long-term realism of the high order . </s>
Mr President , we - myself include - support the report by Mrs Lienemann , the target it set and the directive under discussion . </s>
however , we should look a little more closely at some point . </s>
for example , a major problem in my country be the diversion of river and the consumption of water from lake , which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental argument , and which , of course , be a great risk to ground water , water table and surface water . </s>
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversion take place , the specification common to us all must be very stringent . </s>
but the key issue be , in my opinion , plan how to restore water table , the natural flow of river and the natural content of lake , which must be carry out within the ten year period we have in mind . </s>
I think such project ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy . </s>
Mr President , here we have what be basically a good measure . </s>
it set out achievable standard base on subsidiarity principle and the water basin management . </s>
its aim of good-quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purpose be right . </s>
the prevention of pollution and water deterioration have to be right as well as the ability to manage water in time of drought and flood . </s>
we have three outstanding problem . </s>
the first be the transfer of water between basin area . </s>
that be a matter which affect my colleague from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom . </s>
amendment Nos 4 . </s>
@card@ and @card@ would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it be in supply to where it be need , be that arid area or urban area . </s>
secondly , we have to have realistic target , but target nevertheless . </s>
look at Amendment No 7 , for example , which call for the complete elimination of naturally occur substance , you can see that some of the target set be unrealistic . </s>
also , some of the target which be set at close to zero - in English , that be quite a meaningless term . </s>
we need to look very carefully at those . </s>
the concept of continue reduction as in Amendment no @card@ be much good . </s>
thirdly , I raise the problem face by Scotch whisky . </s>
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which be the good - require water extraction which be use in some quantity and then return to the water stream . </s>
some of it end up in the bottle and be drunk . </s>
we must make sure that Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in &quot; high quality &quot; , which mean it must use good , Scottish peat water . </s>
that be my third request - that we look carefully at these measure before pass this measure as a whole . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the framework directive which we be consider today at second reading be a kind of constitutional charter for water which will apply across the European Union . </s>
this directive represent both a point of arrival and a point of departure . </s>
it be a point of arrival because it be develop from a range of directive which be fragmentary and diffuse , and apply a unified logic and systematic consistency to water legislation . </s>
it be also a point of departure because a new framework of reference have be create , into which future European legislation on water will converge and flow . </s>
the framework directive seek to be , and rightly so , both ambitious and realistic , both strong-minded and carefully think out , and it have , to a large extent , succeed . </s>
Thank to Mrs Lienemann 's excellent work , the amendment propose by the Commission will go some way towards strengthen the directive 's text and make it more rigorous . </s>
make it more rigorous do not mean make it more rigid , by ignore the stark difference in climate and geography across Europe . </s>
the rapporteur 's proposal be one which , on the whole , I would wish to support but I would like to express some praise for it and then two concern . </s>
I would first of all like to praise it because the directive 's demand for the integrated management of water basin be undeniably a step forward . </s>
this also apply to the demand that water only be transfer between basin when this be show to be absolutely necessary . </s>
this be a principle that will prove beneficial and instructive for the Iberian Peninsula for example . </s>
my first concern be about the timetable lay down in the directive : it may prove to be a straitjacket although I think that it also represent a powerful challenge . </s>
my second concern be easy to guess : it turn on the difficulty in establish water charge and in set price , particularly when take environmental cost into account . </s>
this be something that cause anxiety , particularly among farmer . </s>
pay a fair price for water may also result in injustice . </s>
this framework directive bank on a considerable gamble : that in @card@ European water will have return to their natural state , free of pollution and dangerous substance . </s>
be this a Utopian ideal ? </s>
be this a return to pre-industrial society ? </s>
I think not . </s>
I give this framework directive my vote of confidence and of optimism . </s>
the recent catastrophe on the Danube have illustrate , as in a nightmare , that a long-term policy and strategy for the ecological protection of our water , however much it may cost , be not a luxury of the rich but a necessity for civilisation . </s>
Mr President , first of all , we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concern about the environment and water , but whose criminal activity such as the attack against Yugoslavia , aside from leave thousand dead and wounded , have also bring about huge ecological disaster for water resource too , make them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous . </s>
turn to the report , we believe that implement the principle that the cost of water service should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weak stratum , or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmer because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation . </s>
we also wish to point out that especially in area with acute drought problem such as my own country , and especially on the island , funding must be provide for infrastructure for the saving of water , by increase not its cost but its quantity . </s>
this should mainly be carry out by collect the rainwater that now go to waste , run off into the sea and erode the soil , with all the problem that create . </s>
in that spirit , we support Amendment No @card@ by Mr Marset Campos . </s>
River water must also be use more effectively so as to preserve life in area that suffer chronic drought . </s>
finally , as regard the Council 's allegation , which the Commission echo , that there be no need for many specific reference and explanation because they be cover by the example give in the directive or contain elsewhere therein , this be chicanery . </s>
its purpose be to preserve a semi-transparent field of action , which during the directive 's first implementation period will allow critical choice to be finalise to the benefit of big business . </s>
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , be probably one of our most important duty of all . </s>
that be not only because it be about guarantee sufficient water resource but also because it be , to a large degree , about safeguard water resource against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future . </s>
we be all entitle to clean drinking water . </s>
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann 's work on this matter . </s>
it have be a huge task , and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann 's amendment . </s>
these be all improvement to the common position . </s>
moreover , I shall only highlight the most important one . </s>
first and foremost , I think it be important that we should establish some clear objective concern the condition we should have achieve for our water within a period of no more than @card@ year . </s>
I also think it be important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programme more quickly than be propose in the common position . </s>
and , finally , I want to say that I think that the tight arrangement which be be introduce in regard to payment scheme and pricing be quite proper if we , as consumer , be to be give an incentive to use water resource efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangement which can promote the achievement of those environmental goal about which , I believe , there be broad agreement . </s>
in this regard , too , I think that the @card@ deadline be appropriate . </s>
finally , I want to say that I attach great importance to make a start on phase out discharge , emission and leak of hazardous material and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year @card@ by which time we should hopefully have reduce such emission to zero . </s>
if this can be adopt as the objective , then I be naturally prepare to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieve level very close to zero by the year @card@ . </s>
I think that Mrs Lienemann 's proposal be a good basis for further negotiation with the Council . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in draft this important directive . </s>
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water be most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today 's discussion and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement . </s>
first of all we have to find and call to account those who be guilty of the act . </s>
the cyanide and heavy metal in the river be gruesome example of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterway for decade to come . </s>
the event prove that in some country apply for Eu membership the environmental norm and environmental thinking be still light year behind the Eu . </s>
the Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental project can be allocate in a good way in support of a sustainable policy on water . </s>
with regard to the proposal for the directive it be worry that the amendment table by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface water to increase the occurrence of clean , natural groundwater . </s>
in Finland surface water be very clean . </s>
the production of so-called artificial groundwater be an ecological means of filter a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserve . </s>
the process do not require a chemical sewage plant . </s>
the directive must not be allow to endanger this work . </s>
deviate from the Council 's common position , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy be also attempt to restrict further the facility for the transfer of water . </s>
this would cause problem for those country where reserve of water be unevenly distribute . </s>
the ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restrict by Union act . </s>
the work should , of course , be regulate and subject to license in the future too , but the same rule can apply to , for example , Finland and Greece , which suffer from drought . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , water be a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it be our duty to protect it . </s>
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improve the quality and proper management of water resource , and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the point of view . </s>
I must say , however , that , there be discrepancy between the country in the north and south concern water , and that be why the matter can be deal with in the same way . </s>
There be part of Europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be take into account by this directive . </s>
in recent year , climate change have compel Mediterranean country to face serious problem of flooding or lack of rain . </s>
we agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendment table , whose aim be to improve it . </s>
however , we can accept amendment such as those that refer to the issue of cost water , grant that in my country a high proportion of the user be farmer . </s>
in addition , amendment which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many area in my country to water shortage . </s>
the issue of eliminate hazardous substance ought , I think , to be make more realistic so that we can achieve it . </s>
as for the time scale demand for the directive 's implementation , it must be bear in mind that there be country where create the infrastructure for this directive 's implementation will take time and considerable resource . </s>
in spite of these remark however , I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resource can be maintain . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the measure contain in this directive range from draft water management plan , comprehensive information and hearing right , and close cooperation between the Member States , to combat water pollution cause by individual pollutant . </s>
and consider how long this Chamber have be try to introduce a framework directive of this kind , I be please to be present here today , and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on be in the happy position of present this report to us . </s>
however , it be also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for grant . </s>
I would still like to highlight this point though : this directive do not constitute any kind of legal basis for divert water from a Member State 's territory against its will . </s>
and by way of reaffirm this once again , I have introduce an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of member - and I would be very please if Parliament would endorse my propose amendment tomorrow . </s>
it be all about make it clear that water - and this be not the first time this have be mention today - be no ordinary commodity but a resource which belong to the individual Eu Member States and which must be protect and treat with the respect due to it . </s>
I be aware , and the previous speaker highlight this , that there be state in the European Union that have problem with water . </s>
I believe that every one of us , in every country , could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a clean way . </s>
this apply to every country . </s>
but only when each country have do its utmost to conserve its water resource , when literally everything have be do that could have be do in our own country , only then , in my view , should it be necessary to start think in term of harmonise water usage . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , we should be please that this directive have already reach second reading . </s>
however , I must say that I be not over-pleased because I believe that this directive be not of great quality , it be go to be very difficult to implement and have many shortcoming . </s>
firstly , I believe that this directive be excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist . </s>
in many case other existing directive on water have not be comply with and government and the Commission have often not impose discipline as they should have do , although I know that this be not pleasant . </s>
it be not a question of have much tough regulation , because in many case the problem concern management . </s>
it be not a question of exercise the relevant competence and not refer the big problem of the water system to the legislative , the complication of which we be all well aware of . </s>
this be a reductionist directive . </s>
we can lump country with navigable river together with country which lack water , where great crack open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperature of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun . </s>
I say this because the ball do not need to be in our court . </s>
this issue be in the hand of the government and the Commission . </s>
in the same way , this damage and these tragedy which be happen , as in Romania , be not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the government . </s>
furthermore , it be not a fair directive because it ignore the large uninhabited area , climatic diversity , desert area and arid area . </s>
that be how the common position have be word . </s>
the same can be say with regard to transfer . </s>
transfer be an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between people and territory , because unfortunately the earth be not perfect and some area have more and some have less . </s>
lastly , I be highly critical of the fact that the directive be not accompany by a study of its impact . </s>
it be very easy for us to demand that other assess its impact but , on environmental question , we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people , how many farmer , could be ruin by have to pay the cost . </s>
some kind of study have be do which have not even be read , and I believe we should carry out impact study by way of good political practice , rather than just lay down doctrine . </s>
Mr President , through the consolidation of exist directive this framework directive establish the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union . </s>
it be a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin district at national and , in our case in Ireland , cross-border level . </s>
Ireland be very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendment . </s>
a 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , be hardly acceptable . </s>
we have no difficulty with the &quot; polluter pay &quot; principle in relation to the recovery of cost on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level . </s>
however , I feel very strongly that as water be life and access to clean drinking water be a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , cooking and sanitation . </s>
we must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of cost can be balance accordingly . </s>
the introduction of water meter be view with great suspicion in Ireland where we have have no domestic water charge and hence no meter since @card@ . </s>
meter could be view as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin district , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirement . </s>
the whole purpose of this directive be to promote sustainable use of water in the Eu . </s>
Water be a scarce and precious natural resource . </s>
ideally , I would like Amendment no @card@ to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charge . </s>
that would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charge , with each Member States draw up its own scheme , so long as the principle of this directive on incentive for sustainable and efficient use of water be fully protect . </s>
if Amendment no @card@ do not fall , I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemption to the provision of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purpose before contribution to the recovery of cost of water service . </s>
all legislation must be enforceable and be base on the general principle of political acceptance . </s>
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge be a basic human right in the develop as well as the develop world . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , at this point in the debate I be go to insist on certain aspect which , from an agronomic point of view , and since I come from a southern country , I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive . </s>
these include , for example , cost and transfer . </s>
with regard to cost , I would like clarification of what cost we be talk about . </s>
be we talk about the distribution and source of water ? </s>
be we talk about the quality of the distribution network ? </s>
be we talk about the nature of the work require to provide water service ? </s>
or be we talk about large-scale hydraulic work and reservoir ? </s>
All these cost add together would be horrendous and would have repercussion for the agricultural sector . </s>
transfer be define as the transfer of surface water between different territorial area . </s>
be the Commissioner aware that our country have one of the old system of transfer in Europe ? </s>
they already exist in ancient time : they have them in Roman time , although on a small scale . </s>
One of the most significant transfer - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which have be in use for many year , almost @card@ year , have an allowance of @card@ hm3 per year . </s>
the large volume transfer in one year have be @card@ and the average volume over twenty year have be over @card@ . </s>
we can be accuse of bad management . </s>
be the Commissioner aware that , of this @card@ hm3 , we use @card@ for irrigation on the leave bank of the Levante , @card@ for water supply in the area of the Júcar , 7 for supply in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura , equally divide between supply and irrigation ? </s>
we be not do a bad job of management . </s>
we can be prohibit from carry out transfer when our economy and the development of our region depend on it . </s>
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the good available technology , because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive . </s>
take good note : in this diverse Europe , which we be build in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solution , not single solution . </s>
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission , the Council and this House so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different country of Europe in area where subsidiarity be require . </s>
Commissioner , Andalusia be not Lapland . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , I want , of course , to begin by thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and , above all , the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she have put into the present framework water directive . </s>
water be one of our most important natural resource , as many speaker have already say . </s>
an ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water be an important component of guarantee sustainable development for Europe . </s>
water be also one of the issue to which I shall be devote particular attention during my term of office . </s>
I be please about the spirit of agreement which permeate the amendment that have be submit to Parliament . </s>
Many of them be base upon the very constructive , informal discussion which have take place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading . </s>
most of Parliament 's propose amendment help improve the text and make it more ambitious . </s>
the Commission can approve @card@ of the @card@ amendment , either in their entirety , partially or in principle . </s>
Many of the amendment which Parliament have submit show that reconciliation will be necessary . </s>
with a view to these forthcoming negotiation , I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position . </s>
firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important argument . </s>
we now have the opportunity to put into practice those measure to which we agree under the OSPAR Convention . </s>
rather than make these objective legally bind , we must consider their political nature . </s>
this be also reflect in many of Parliament 's amendment . </s>
where water charge be concern , the present directive will constitute Europe 's water policy for the next three decade . </s>
it be our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provide the right incentive and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charge which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way . </s>
it sound good , say that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge . </s>
but water be not free of charge , any more than house or food be free of charge . </s>
it be only by mean of efficient instrument of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water be well manage and more carefully husband as a resource . </s>
I also want to add that , when it come to groundwater and to water which have be heavily modify by human activity , I support a tight timetable and a clarification of goal and of criterion for allow exception to the rule . </s>
I also support expressly mention radioactive substance . </s>
in the course of the debate , many speaker have point out how important it be to consult the general public and keep them inform . </s>
I just want to emphasise this further . </s>
it be absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keep them well inform and by proceed to consult them . </s>
this be also express in Recital @card@ . </s>
allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that , in common with my Scottish colleague , he need have no pang of conscience about continue to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again . </s>
we have not consider it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production . </s>
allow me now to comment on some of the area in a little more detail . </s>
limit discharge of hazardous substance into our water must be one of the most important objective . </s>
I be glad to see that Parliament 's amendment have focus upon this . </s>
the Commission fully support the proposal to introduce the commitment under the OSPAR Convention into the text . </s>
we must , however , keep to their precise scope and content . </s>
as I say , their purpose and the timetable for implement them be political in character . </s>
it would not be in keep with this to introduce a legally binding timetable . </s>
it must nonetheless be guarantee that the Member States and the Community be compel to take measure to achieve the relevant goal and comply with the timetable . </s>
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
the Commission can , on the other hand , approve Amendment No @card@ , in which hazardous substance be define differently than in OSPAR . </s>
the Commission 's proposal introduce a clear procedure for select substance , and so no definition be need . </s>
even if I too agree with the content of Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ , these go beyond the commitment under OSPAR , and I can therefore approve these amendment . </s>
the Commission can also , in principle , approve Amendment No @card@ , accord to which a timetable be require for implement the Commission 's proposal to limit discharge of prioritised substance . </s>
amendment no @card@ introduce requirement to the effect that the list of prioritised substance should continually be review . </s>
this would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and can , therefore , be approve . </s>
the desire express in Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ for a list of goal and a list of substance for which no adequate data be available can be approve . </s>
list of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedure for adopt the list of prioritised substance . </s>
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention do not in any way alter existing Community legislation concern nitrate from the agricultural sector . </s>
the Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influence by the present framework directive . </s>
I appreciate the fact that Parliament have prove to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of impose charge for water service . </s>
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which create incentive to use water resource in a sustainable way . </s>
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own cost . </s>
I can therefore partly , and in principle , approve Amendments Nos @card@ , together with Amendment No @card@ . </s>
I believe that we need legally binding requirement state that the financial cost of water service be to be cover by each economic sector . </s>
this would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measure . </s>
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No @card@ , which be in line with the Commission 's original proposal . </s>
I also support a gradual development in the direction of cover environmental cost and the cost of resource . </s>
we be aware of the fact that the price of water and water service be a complicated issue and that account must be take not only of environmental goal but also of social and economic goal . </s>
this must not , however , be an excuse for subsidise inefficient economic sector which cause pollution . </s>
we intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question . </s>
I agree with Parliament that the common position 's sixteen-year timeframe for implement these measure must be considerably reduce . </s>
the same also apply to the possibility which exist of extend the period of implementation by a further eighteen year . </s>
Amendment No @card@ , cancel the third extension period , be an important step in the right direction . </s>
this proposal can therefore be approve . </s>
a period of ten year , as propose in Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ , among other , be , on the other hand , too short . </s>
I believe that consideration ought to be give to wording the overall definition of the requirement under the proposal in such a way that it include a strict and explicit condition to the effect that cause deterioration of the environment must be avoid . </s>
the proposal must also include more stringent criterion for establish lesser environmental objective and for extend deadline in connection with heavily modified or artificial body of water . </s>
this apply to Amendments Nos 6 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
these Amendments may in large part be approve and will be support until such time as an overall solution can be find . </s>
To comply with the demand in Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ , to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension , would be go too far , and these can be approve . </s>
another important area be protection of the groundwater . </s>
we need both a start point and a final goal if we be to reverse the upward trend in pollution . </s>
we also need strict criterion for interpret the result of any monitoring . </s>
the most important part of Parliament 's Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ can therefore be approve in principle . </s>
the new definition in Amendment no @card@ be , however , too strict and can be apply for this purpose . </s>
I would propose that Amendment No @card@ should be incorporate into a broad solution . </s>
amendment no @card@ do not take account of seasonal variation and annual change in the level of the groundwater . </s>
the proposal can therefore be approve . </s>
the Commission consider it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standard guarantee that the least intensive water purification be adequate to ensure that surface water be of drink water quality . </s>
instead , we prefer an addition to those measure which be require in accordance with Article @card@ to promote activity in this area . </s>
the good status which be require under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality be fulfill . </s>
this part of Amendment no @card@ can , therefore , be approve . </s>
the Commission appreciate Parliament 's effort to guarantee that the so-called combined approach be give a central role . </s>
this approach and its scope , which the Commission can in principle approve , be define by Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ . </s>
in order to achieve the great possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to reformulate Amendment no @card@ and to add a de minimis provision . </s>
the transfer of water be already cover by control , but explicitly mention it make the text clear . </s>
these part of Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ can , therefore , be approve . </s>
it be nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measure for control demand should be adopt . </s>
the proposal already specify that water must be abstract in accordance with the ecological need in the river basin district concern . </s>
these part of Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ can , therefore , be approve . </s>
the Commission approve Amendment No @card@ to the effect that radioactive substance be explicitly to be include in the proposal . </s>
To summarise , the Commission be able to approve @card@ amendment , either in their entirety , partially or in principle . </s>
the follow amendment can be approve : 1 , 4 , 9 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
finally , I want to say that I welcome the effort which Parliament have make to try to solve the question on which the Council take other view . </s>
important progress have be make , and the constructive tone of the discussion create a good work climate for future discussion . </s>
a number of obstacle remain , but I be convince that , as the legislative work progress , we shall achieve our common goal of create a water policy we can be proud of . </s>
Parliament be adopt a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , European water policy for the next three decade . </s>
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No @card@ . </s>
I may have miss it in the list she give out . </s>
. </s>
I accept that . </s>
thank you , Mrs Wallström . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. Financial instrument for the environment ( Life ) the next item be the recommendation for second reading ( A4-0014 / @card@ ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopt by the Council with a view to adopt a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment ( Life ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Lienemann ) . </s>
rapporteur . </s>
( FR ) Mr President , we have already have the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and I be give to believe in committee that there be a broad consensus within this House . </s>
life be the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget , and one can help but note that it do not live up to our ambition since the amount allocate to it have be stagnate for year . </s>
despite the enlargement which have already take place , when we renew the first Life programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriation remain the same . </s>
and then we see that , increasingly , the region , the various operator , business , association , be submit LIFE project , both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT , project that be of excellent quality , which follow technical assessment by all the competent committee be unanimously find to be worthy of European Union support , but we still can fund them , for lack of budget appropriation . </s>
it must also be mention that this budget experience a rate of consumption of appropriation which be quite exceptional within the Community budget . </s>
patently we have here an instrument that be appropriate for the policy which we wish to implement . </s>
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular . </s>
we be well aware that , in the European Union , a whole raft of directive such as the directive on habitat and the directive on migratory bird encounter problem in implementation . </s>
with LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policy which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objective of these directive , and their capacity to be implement . </s>
and , for want of appropriation , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directive of ours be not reasonable and be not applicable to develop . </s>
and so the debate take place today focus on two major issue : firstly , comitology , an ongoing debate within this House , but Parliament wish to implement policy settle rather by management committee or advisory committee which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we be here to stand up for within the European Parliament . </s>
but we have these comitology debate with regard to most of the European Union 's financial programme and instrument . </s>
I would say that in my opinion - and the experience we have have in the past tend to show this - that reconcile opinion on comitology be rather easy than reconcile opinion on the budget . </s>
let me point out that Parliament be ask for @card@ million ecus in appropriation , not a vast sum in the Community budget , and that the current proposal be for @card@ million ecus . </s>
I feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of Life , at least , there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment . </s>
let me conclude with the matter of our institution ' way of work . </s>
this be the essence of how I understand the situation : we be be tell that it be essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly , that , basically , the member of Parliament should drop their claim , particularly claim on the budget , for if we do not soon , in line with the codecision procedure , get around to establish the framework of the regulation for Life , then its implementation for the year @card@ be go to suffer a delay , and in the meantime the NGOs and the operator at grass root level be wait for our appropriation . </s>
I would , however , like to point out that the Council have plenty of time to formulate its idea and that it be submit its proposal to us only a few month before the fateful date . </s>
as for us , we our bind by the term of the text : a maximum of four month . </s>
we meet our deadline and afterwards we be tell that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the other , because in the codecision procedure there be just not enough time . </s>
I think Parliament often protest about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council , and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affair , since , the truth be , it be something of a tradition , which the Council have keep go for a long time . </s>
but I should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue be a central one and Parliament can yield to the blackmail which require it to be the only reasonable party in the deal . </s>
I therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow member will support us in the conciliation - but vote on this area be always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other . </s>
Mr President , it be true that we be in open disagreement on some of the choice make by the Council and the Commission , and I will refer to this later on . </s>
it be equally true , however , that we should begin by say that this regulation be good than those cover Life I and Life II . </s>
it be well firstly because the framework proposal make Life I more rigorous , more transparent and more rational . </s>
secondly , it be good because the common position include some fundamental recommendation , which be advocate by the European Parliament at first reading . </s>
specifically , these be : to promote employment as a factor to be take into consideration when select candidate project , and to reduce the environmental impact of product at every stage from production to recycling and elimination . </s>
this be one of the aim that LIFE-Environment must achieve . </s>
thirdly , the fact that the common position have for the first time introduce upgrade and plan for coastal area as one of LIFE-Environment 's priority be an extremely positive step . </s>
in spite of all its virtue though , Life III 's regulation fail in what be obviously the most important aspect of determine a financial instrument 's impact , which be its budget . </s>
by persist with their proposal of EUR @card@ million as a reference amount for @card@ - @card@ , and by refuse to accept the European Parliament 's proposal of EUR @card@ million , the Commission and the Council be take a decision which we do not feel be base on the same criterion of rationality and justice that they introduce , and rightly so , for other measure in Life III . </s>
we want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up try to provide Life with the budget it deserve and which good guarantee the environmental result that we be seek to achieve with this kind of instrument . </s>
we have four very straightforward argument which we feel justify our choice . </s>
firstly , Life be the only direct financial instrument which be design to promote environmental policy within the European Union . </s>
There be no other such policy . </s>
secondly , Life be an instrument that have already produce good result , and have enable innovative method and technique to be develop and have an excellent rate of implementation . </s>
thirdly , the Life budget have be reduce in real term have not keep up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand . </s>
fourthly , as Parliament ascribe so much value to Life , it have allocate ever-greater appropriation to this project in its annual budget . </s>
this mean that approve the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend . </s>
our concern do not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however . </s>
climate change and water policy be subject that be of great concern to the European public and which have deserve considerable attention from this House . </s>
we therefore feel it be crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objective which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reduce greenhouse gas , they should be adopt . </s>
lastly , I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be vote in favour of her amendment on comitology even though , as be make clear in the Committee on the Environment , we would prefer Life to have be monitor by an advisory committee , we do want to contribute to allow the solution propose by the Council to be accept as quite frankly , it be worse . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , you be right , Commissioner , to bring pressure to bear on those Member States who have fail to transpose the flora and fauna directive , and that include the Member State I come from . </s>
you be right to do so because demand be be make on our natural habitat , and we must transpose these Natura @card@ region at long last . </s>
however , if that happen then of course we will have a huge need for LIFE-Natura funding , because of course we will also have to finance conservation measure in these area , which be ultimately to be designate , and that at a time when we can even stabilise the thing we have achieve with Life I and Life II . </s>
give this situation , i. e. that flora and fauna area now have to be transpose with a vengeance , we will definitely need more money for Life as well . </s>
this bring me on to the subject of the Council , which be a past master when it come to decision on expenditure , particularly in the sphere of foreign policy , which we then have to find the money for in our budget . </s>
I need only mention the aid for Bosnia - we be cut back on all front there . </s>
on the other hand , the Council refuse to take a more long-term view and increase the Life budget by what be in fact a derisory amount in the context of the overall budget , for an area which , when all be say and do , be all about us create sustainable development . </s>
I can fathom this at all and expressly call upon all my fellow MEPs to support Mrs Lienemann 's motion on raise the funding to EUR @card@ million . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , Life be the European Union 's most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicate exclusively to the environment . </s>
that explain why this instrument must live up to our ambition , ambition for which , of course , there be a price . </s>
obviously , the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for Life III . </s>
the common position stipulate a total appropriation of EUR @card@ million for the period @card@ . </s>
this be not enough . </s>
the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party be in favour of increase this amount to EUR @card@ million . </s>
we therefore support Mrs Lienemann 's amendment which observe that the allocation for Life be not increase when the Union be last enlarge , without even mention the next batch of new arrival . </s>
the amount that we be ask for be no great mountain of useless expenditure . </s>
Quite the opposite , it be still fairly modest in relation to the requirement to be fund . </s>
a drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe 's structural policy . </s>
the environment be still the poor relation in the European budget , even though it be primarily an investment . </s>
an investment in natural resource , of course , but also in employment , since it have be demonstrate that an active environmental policy generate new job , as show particularly by the great success of Life , a success with NGOs , business , local authority and third country . </s>
more than one third of the @card@ request receive meet the require condition and it have be possible to cofinance approximately @card@ project between @card@ and @card@ . </s>
a success which Parliament wish and intend to see perpetuated , and this be why we also support amendment @card@ outline the fourth phase of the Life project . </s>
in matter of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of form , and indeed must come in a variety of form in the long term . </s>
this be the price of the future of generation to come . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I be probably go to repeat thing my fellow member have say but I believe that , as far as the Council be concern , the thing be to repeat over and over what we think of Life . </s>
I shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur have already say quite clearly , Life be the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union 's policy on the environment . </s>
this instrument be absolutely essential since it provide the impetus for truly innovative action in favour of nature and the environment in Europe , which be adopt and expand upon by the Member States . </s>
this financial instrument be , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it be accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisation . </s>
that be why , lady and gentleman , I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendment which have no appreciation of the spirit of Life . </s>
through the association , then , Life be a facility that can be use by the European citizen directly , and for the benefit of action in the interest of the community . </s>
several million Ngo member - million , I say - recognise in Life the Union 's determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage . </s>
life be , moreover , the fundamental instrument of the Natura @card@ network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot , pursuant to Community directive on the habitat of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory bird , and which make it possible to set up the protection of site of high biological value in our state . </s>
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstruct European nature conservation policy . </s>
this be a pity because everyone within this Chamber know that Life be a financial instrument which be not sufficient to carry out the project submit by Member States , a good many of which be turn down due to lack of fund . </s>
let us not forget that , to date , Life amount to only EUR @card@ million per annum , I. E. scarcely @card@ % of the budget of the European Union . </s>
for the record , the budget for agriculture , which have a real impact on the environment , amount , as we all know , to EUR @card@ billion . </s>
against this background , my group think it essential to increase the allocation to Life and unreservedly support Mrs Lienemann 's proposal to increase the budget to EUR @card@ million , since we know , and I think it bear say , how high the expectation of our fellow citizen on environmental matter be and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council 's compromise regard the budget for Life be , especially as the Life programme show exceptional implementation rate and have demonstrate the extent to which they make it possible to bring about new environmental practice . </s>
the first sustainable development project be unquestionably those . </s>
Mr President , the European Union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount ( EUR @card@ million ) have be allocate , give rise to many question regard the proper use of public fund . </s>
a financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective , and this be not the case for the follow reason : poorly define selection criterion , dubious uncoordinated operation , assessment not make public and the lack of any assessment policy . </s>
we be therefore propose to amend the regulation as follow . </s>
firstly , to reserve the acquisition make thank to Life fund exclusively to public body , subsequently , follow invitation to tender , to entrust the management of these site to authorise nature conservation association . </s>
it be a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisition , since private law association may disappear or resell acquisition . </s>
it be shocking in philosophical term and dubious in legal term for @card@ % public money to be use to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection . </s>
secondly , to define the criterion for the eligibility and allocation of Life fund , in order to rule our any suspicion of clientelism or ostracism . </s>
thirdly , to make prior coordination with the user and community concern a prerequisite . </s>
for example , the LIFE-Nature project in France , at Grand-Lieu Lake , plan without any coordination , lead to a real ecological disaster , the de-silting operation which be carry out without regard for French law on the subject cause significant silting of the Acheneau , a water course locate downstream , destroy spawn bed , fill wetland , and who know what else . </s>
the silt be in fact shift 3 kilometre , at a cost of FF 6 million , the cure be bad than the disease , and a consequence that be foreseeable and actually predict by the party involve with the site . </s>
result : a court action and repair cost great than the cost of the programme itself . </s>
this be the sort of thing that we want to avoid . </s>
Four , to include representative of Parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one Member per political group . </s>
What could be fair than for member of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriation they vote for ? </s>
fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of Life operation carry out . </s>
Six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programme on a regular basis . </s>
Seven , to make it possible for these fund to be use in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation follow storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment follow an oil slick , etc . </s>
here , Mrs Lienemann , Mr President , we be put forward here a practical proposal , a common sense proposal , easy to implement , likely to limit local conflict and to vindicate the proper use of public monies , before increase the Life budget line by as much as @card@ % ! </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she have carry out , and also the Commission - why not ? </s>
- because this report , this position , generally improve on the text in force . </s>
furthermore , it contain more acceptable systematics and be clear and more transparent . </s>
I would also like to congratulate the service of the Commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the Life programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of project . </s>
however , I would like to insist on certain point . </s>
firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I be not question . </s>
secondly , the financial contribution . </s>
sadly , only @card@ % of the project request receive fund . </s>
of the EUR 1 @card@ million request , only EUR @card@ million have be grant . </s>
now the financial statement show only EUR @card@ million to cover more country and competence . </s>
Parliament have propose EUR @card@ million , but the document repeat the initial proposal of EUR @card@ million . </s>
Commissioner , our environmental commitment be increase in all area , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicate to the environment be decrease . </s>
be this not a contradiction ? </s>
let us not demand from other what we be not prepare to give ourselves ? </s>
why do we all go on about the environment and be then not prepare to pay for it amongst all of us , but rather expect the usual people , the one who live there all year , to pay for it and maintain it ? </s>
commissioner , we must be consistent . </s>
the cost of maintain the environment , which we all enjoy , must be meet by all of us , and the Life programme be the only financial instrument aim exclusively at the environment and whose project have generally be effective . </s>
Mr President , Life have be the principal instrument available to the Community since @card@ for support and develop environmental policy , both within the Community and in the surround third country . </s>
on the basis of the experience gain over the past eight year , an attempt be be make to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument . </s>
the funding of activity for the implementation , adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policy , particularly one that contribute towards sustainable development , be central element of the regulation we be to vote upon . </s>
an important element of LIFE-Nature , which mainly concern the realisation of the Natura @card@ network , be the introduction of a multinational approach to formulate plan for international project and activity , so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotope and to offer good protection of biodiversity . </s>
in the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which be more concern with project involve small and medium-sized enterprise and local government agency , the incorporation of the environment in other policy be express very clearly indeed . </s>
as regard the financing package for the implementation of Life over the next five year , I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR @card@ million to EUR @card@ million propose by the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann . </s>
unless the necessary mean be secure to pursue environmental protection , there be no point on the one hand in continue to raise the environmental awareness achieve in recent year , and on the other hand in incorporate the environmental dimension in other policy . </s>
besides , we can remain indifferent towards the increase challenge in area around the Union or towards address very acute environmental protection problem in the applicant country . </s>
What have happen over the past few day with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary have be instructive . </s>
consequently , I consider that support for environmental action under the Life financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfill the Community 's mission of achieve a high level of environmental protection and improvement . </s>
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrate in the two report we have discuss this evening . </s>
Two minute be certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic . </s>
so I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue . </s>
for five year , I have be the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly do not have Parliament 's broad perspective . </s>
the environment be in a parlous state . </s>
like a number of previous speaker , I , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of find funding for project , which , in my view , should be incorporate into the pubic domain . </s>
as regard funding , EUR @card@ million be not enough . </s>
even EUR @card@ million be not enough . </s>
at the end of August @card@ , I take part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it be say that EUR 2 million , or ITL 4 @card@ billion , should go towards eliminate or , at any rate , reduce smoking . </s>
however , the environment constitute a far big and more serious problem than smoking . </s>
EUR @card@ million - assume that such a figure be actually agree - believe me , be not enough , in practical term , to allow any type of project to be carry out . </s>
in many area the park which be a fundamental element in the Life programme have be establish . </s>
but create park with very limit financial resource , without any system of sign be inefficient and ineffectual . </s>
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , ever since the beginning of @card@ , discussion have take place between the institution on the subject of the propose regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment know as Life . </s>
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have have on this matter . </s>
as a result of this , I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approve nine of the fourteen amendment which have be adopt by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . </s>
the Commission welcome , above all , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , which apply to the Committee procedure . </s>
in these case , Parliament have fully take account of the objection which the Commission have to the common position . </s>
the Commission can , in principle , also approve Amendment no 4 which ought , however , to be introduce into another place in the text . </s>
with regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6 , I want to emphasise that project for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with project for reduce form of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , be to a large degree cover by Life . </s>
the Commission nonetheless consider that , if this be state separately , then that be to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority area . </s>
There be also a risk of overlap with other Community programme such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research , Technical Development and Demonstration . </s>
the present programme 's key measure - water quality , tomorrow 's city and innovative product and process - to a certain degree cover the same question . </s>
where the question of the budget be concern , I be please about the confidence show by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . </s>
Amendment no @card@ require a large budget than that state in the common position . </s>
I be also convince that Life have great potential . </s>
this instrument could finance good project with a high amount of money than that quote in the propose budget . </s>
the amount quote in Amendment no @card@ do not , however , tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda @card@ . </s>
allow me also to add that , if the budget be increase , great demand be obviously go to be make upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increase number of project be go to be deal with . </s>
account will also have to be take of other programme where decision be to be make within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure . </s>
at this stage , the Commission be keep to the amount which have be set in the common position . </s>
with regard to Amendment No 3 , which we do not approve at first reading , I want to emphasise that each programme have its own objective , condition under which it may be apply for and cost which make it eligible for aid . </s>
it be therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer project from Life to other instrument . </s>
if other source of finance be to be investigate for each project , more resource would , moreover , be require than be available in the present situation . </s>
now that the Commission have to consider carefully what resource be require for each activity , this be an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid : one that be inessential but demand in term of resource . </s>
nor can the Commission approve Amendment No @card@ , which be contrary to the Commission 's right of initiative . </s>
with regard to the discussion concern the deadline , I want to say that the final date for begin to implement Life - @card@ March @card@ , as set in the common position - must now be move forward . </s>
the date will be fix as soon as the present regulation have be adopt . </s>
finally , I want to repeat that I be convince that Life will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community 's environmental policy . </s>
Parliament have contribute greatly to improve this instrument . </s>
I be convince that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there be great expectation in the Member States and in other country , especially among the applicant state which be now be give the opportunity to participate in Life . </s>
thank you , Mrs Wallström . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ a. M. Modernising social protection the next item be the report ( A5-0033 / @card@ ) , by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernise social protection [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0253 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] . </s>
Mr President , the issue of social security system be an important one . </s>
this be a natural consequence of cooperation within the Eu . </s>
the basis be monetary cooperation , which have since be follow up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy . </s>
it be now a natural consequence to move on to social security system . </s>
these area be mutually dependent upon one another . </s>
economic stability be a reason for growth and can provide high employment . </s>
it also provide the opportunity to develop welfare provision . </s>
but the reverse be also the case : a well-develop policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increase growth . </s>
in other word , social security be a factor of production . </s>
social security system differ from one Eu country to another . </s>
this be largely due to historical factor . </s>
we be now face with a number of common challenge , however ; demographic development , for example , which have to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the low birth rate . </s>
the labour market be also change . </s>
woman be venture into the labour market in ever great number . </s>
another challenge be present by technical development . </s>
we must meet these challenge together . </s>
the Commission 's communication recommend that experience should be more widely share , a high-level group form and benchmarking introduce . </s>
What be more , the report on social security should be publish annually and examine in conjunction with the report on employment . </s>
this be good , but it be not enough . </s>
we propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process . </s>
clear guideline and indicator be require . </s>
at the same time , the Member States be to formulate the relevant method in national action plan . </s>
we be create a common model , but retain the principle of subsidiarity . </s>
this social convergence be a process which will continue for a long period . </s>
Parliament must therefore be involve in the work - not by be part of the high-level group , but by enable parliamentary representative to track the work of the latter and come up with proposal as to how the process be to be carry on . </s>
like the work on employment , the Commission 's proposal be found upon four pillar . </s>
these be : to make the system employment-friendly ; to make the pension system sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high-quality health and medical care . </s>
All this be important . </s>
in our report , we have highlight the importance of combat poverty within the Eu and of find indicator as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area . </s>
equality have no pillar of its own . </s>
there , it be mainstreaming which apply . </s>
all four pillar should reflect aspect of equality . </s>
this be something we have bear in mind . </s>
we be submit a wide range of proposal to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to individualise social security system ; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefit under the social security system ; that there should be good opportunity to combine family and work life ; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living . </s>
these proposal favour woman especially . </s>
parallel to this European strategy of social convergence , a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere be require , together with proposal for framework agreement in the context of the dialogue between employer and employee , accompany by a concrete timetable . </s>
we expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme . </s>
social convergence be also need before the enlargement of the Union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dump . </s>
the Commission ought to consider devise a special action programme concern social policy in connection with enlargement . </s>
we have have a constructive discussion in the Committee . </s>
we have a lot of amendment , but succeed in agree upon a report . </s>
now , the amendment which be to be vote on at the plenary sit have be reduce in number to only fifteen . </s>
this indicate that we have a broad consensus . </s>
a number of these amendment have come back from the Committee reading , and these I shall reject . </s>
I shall also reject those amendment which have be table by the Technical Group of Independent Members , because I do not think that these add anything to the report . </s>
on the other hand , my group will applaud Amendment no @card@ from the group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party . </s>
I think this proposal be a good one . </s>
certainly , it resemble Amendment No 1 , but Amendment no @card@ be good . </s>
finally , I want to say that the Eu be not only concern with cooperation on trade . </s>
the Eu be also a union for employment and social justice . </s>
in create a citizen ' Europe , social policy have an important role to play . </s>
by mean of this report , Parliament wish to make its contribution to reinforce the social dimension of European society . </s>
we hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy . </s>
the Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , a long-term , workable social protection system in which man and woman 's particular lifestyle be safeguard on the basis of equality , be indispensable to social cohesion and stability for our society . </s>
the mutual interdependence of issue pertain to the national economy , employment policy , and social protection in the internal market call for there to be joint deliberation at Community level in this respect . </s>
we have not achieve equal right for man and woman either in the sphere of work or that of social protection . </s>
the unemployment rate for woman be considerably high than that for man . </s>
it be still much more difficult for woman to gain access to certain profession and there be far more woman than man in precarious and part-time job . </s>
wage level for woman be still way below those for man . </s>
as a result , they have a low level of social protection or none whatsoever , for pay employment serve as the basis for this accord to system currently in force . </s>
Many woman be only accord derive right , which reinforce their economic dependence . </s>
in view of the fact that economic and social condition have change , we should aim to achieve individualise social protection , with people be treat independently of their partner , and guarantee lasting security . </s>
however , it must still be worth an individual 's while to work , notwithstanding all the necessary contribution . </s>
reform social protection must encompass support for and recognition of , in insurance law term , the time it take to bring up child , as well as care of needy family member . </s>
it be shocking that an ever-increase number of elderly woman live in poverty . </s>
they be unable to contribute to the social security system because of the time they invest in bring up their family , but they too must be afford protection . </s>
an individual 's entitlement to high-quality health care must be assure , irrespective of their contribution to the economy . </s>
as before , in principle it be the Member States that be responsible for frame and finance their social protection system . </s>
nevertheless , cooperation within the Eu on the part of the expert work group , in which woman must be suitably represent , could be instrumental in bring about convergence of the social system in the long term . </s>
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Andersson , very warmly on his report on modernise social protection which be now under discussion . </s>
in the capacity of coordinator of the European People 's Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I be very please with the compromise which be reach and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into . </s>
I be also delighted that he base the report on a report which be write by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and have partly follow the gist of this old report . </s>
the goal of the Commission 's notification of June @card@ , on which the Andersson report be base , be to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the Eu in term of social protection . </s>
Key sub-goals be : promote employment and ensure that work secure a fix income ; secondly , safeguard old-age pension and make these affordable ; thirdly , promote social integration and fourthly , guarantee affordable , first-rate health protection . </s>
Gender-related aspect must feature prominently in all these goal . </s>
I believe that congratulation be also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification , for these four point be , in fact , to a very large number of Eu citizen extremely important - if not the most important point which merit further thought . </s>
the Commission 's communication be an important strategic document for bring about European social convergence . </s>
macro-economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this be why they should be bring more closely together . </s>
the Commission have recognise this interrelatedness . </s>
it be our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which be , of course , underpin by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy . </s>
these aspect be very much interconnect . </s>
it be , therefore , surprise that this topic have , to date , not be incorporate in a strategy and this be why the Commission 's notification constitute a break-through in a way . </s>
it bring me great joy to witness that the Council now seem to accept this break-through and also want to bring it to the fore in Lisbon . </s>
we should , of course , not get overly excited about it . </s>
it mark the beginning , rather than the end , of a process . </s>
some people have wonder whether our demand be too low or whether there should be more dialogue . </s>
but it be extremely significant for the process to be set in motion . </s>
the issue involve be extremely important but the system in the European Union be quite different from one another . </s>
the challenge be different . </s>
the level of employment be different and this be why it be very important to set the ball roll gently but to make steady progress nonetheless . </s>
in this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenge . </s>
the majority within my group be of the opinion that something like this need to happen . </s>
the funny thing about the Andersson report be that it do not get bog down with too many detail of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it be not a pie-in-the-sky report . </s>
it be a report which try to give direction . </s>
There be , however , one or two aspect about which I have doubt as to whether or not we be be too specific . </s>
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this . </s>
but that do not take away from the fact that the report 's importance mainly lie in the fact that we be develop a strategy and that there be a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon . </s>
I believe that if it be to be adopt in Lisbon in this way , Lisbon will turn out to be a success . </s>
if it be not adopt , Lisbon will not add much to what have already be say in the past . </s>
as far as this be concern , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of Lisbon , because it be really innovative , while many other thing be merely a rumination of what have be say before . </s>
all in all , I be indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report . </s>
I hope that Europe , in term of social protection , will make a step forward , take into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible . </s>
commissioner , lady and gentleman , like my fellow MEP , Bartho Pronk , please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he have put into this report . </s>
Commissioner , the fact that this report be no longer controversial within Parliament do not mean that it have lose any of its crucial importance . </s>
There have be time within this Parliament when such discussion on social security be actually quite awkward . </s>
it be also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk say just a moment ago - at a time when preparation be in full swing for the Lisbon Summit , which intend to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society . </s>
within my group , it speak for itself that social protection form an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be add to the agenda in Lisbon . </s>
my group be please that the Social Affairs Council give the go-ahead for a good cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high-ranking official have already be commission to submit to the Council an initial report by June @card@ . </s>
however , we , the Parliament and , in particular , the group of the Social Democrats , want Lisbon to go one step further now . </s>
it be of great importance that , in our fellow MEP 's report , this European Parliament advocate a true European strategy of social convergence , base on what provision have be make for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy , that be to say it should encompass common goal , guideline , national action plan and performance evaluation . </s>
we believe that this course of action be ambitious , yet achievable . </s>
needless to say , it be clear that harmonisation of social security be not viable at European level . </s>
the financial and organisational system vary too greatly for this , and this be also an important reason why social protection have only just be put on the European agenda , and why , in fact , scenario such as Danny Peters ' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely get off the ground . </s>
but this new course of action be very exciting . </s>
the employment strategy have prove that it can function well and social convergence be also necessary , for our social security system be face the same challenge , and in an EMU era , social security system would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition . </s>
but let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategy should not be an alternative to social legislation . </s>
they can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we be develop and expect from the Commission in term of social legislation . </s>
I think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the European Parliament try to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty level no later than at the beginning of @card@ . </s>
I be please about the fact that the European Parliament support my group 's idea and we hope , Commissioner , that we can also count on your support . </s>
finally , we urge the European Parliament , both side of industry and social NGOs to be closely involve in this process . </s>
the success of this strategy hinge on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support . </s>
Mr President , the four chief objective which the Eu country ' government endorse in November of last year and which be mention earlier here today be as follow : that care should be take to ensure that it be worthwhile work and guarantee oneself a secure income ; that pension should be guarantee and pension arrangement make sustainable ; that social integration should be promote ; and that sustainable , high-quality health care should be guarantee . </s>
these be four goal which have be word in such broad term that everyone must be able to support them . </s>
have a group of high-ranking official as the focal point for the pool of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the way in which social and labour market policy be be develop be also something we can all benefit from . </s>
the Commission 's communication , which we be discuss today and which be put by for a decision by the Council in November , be a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenge face by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few year when we have age population and be experience the effect of the enlargement of the Union . </s>
we now already have major social problem and major social cost to find from the public budget , which be a problem for many Member States . </s>
if reform be not get under way , we be in danger of erode the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy be now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security . </s>
it be therefore only reasonable to put these subject on the agenda . </s>
in the debate about coordination of social policy in the Eu , we often use the expression social convergence . </s>
as liberal , we can support this concept when it mean that we in the Eu be to establish broad common objective with which the individual country then seek to comply by mean of their own national social policy . </s>
it be not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objective . </s>
it be , of course , a fact that the Eu country have different way of organise social policy . </s>
we have different tradition and there be difference in culture and , in spite of there be many point of similarity , there be also major difference between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problem concern . </s>
it be therefore important to emphasise that social policy be a national concern . </s>
national policy be , of course , subject to a number of common parameter . </s>
that be the case with minimum social entitlement , which be establish by treaty . </s>
it be true in regard to guarantee the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlement . </s>
it apply to the fact of our have to coordinate our economy ; and it apply in the case of economic cooperation . </s>
so coordination and cooperation be fact of life . </s>
but convergence should be about goal , not mean . </s>
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Jan Andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different position and to secure support for his report . </s>
I can support the report , but there be a few point which be not completely to my taste . </s>
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what be refer to as unfair competition between social and tax system , if interference of this kind be to be use to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of make our social system more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many Eu country . </s>
I be sceptical about the detailed regulation that might result from the Commission be have to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and I be sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold . </s>
dialogue and the coordination of social policy be to be commend , but we should not lump all nation together as if they be the same . </s>
There should be room for a multiplicity of solution . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , with regard to the strategy which have be set out here on modernise social security , I would like to point out some positive thing as well as raise some question that have come up for me . </s>
I feel positive about the movement which be very gradually take place in the dossier . </s>
this seem to be a good thing and useful . </s>
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach . </s>
we therefore hope that the four objective which be mention in it can reasonably be achieve . </s>
we would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy be handle . </s>
on the one hand , it would be useful to have guideline and a process style on Luxembourg , but we also think it be important , as be already mention by Mrs Van Lancker , that guideline be draft to accommodate less typical work scenario , such as sole trader , etc . </s>
we nonetheless foresee two problem for which solution will need to be find . </s>
the first problem be that concern the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replace by high-level convergence . </s>
I can illustrate this with example from a study which be carry out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reform within the European Union . </s>
it appear from this study that adjustment be rife but most of these adjustment , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustment , the remainder be improvement . </s>
the lion 's share of these adjustment pertain to pension plan : eleven restriction and two improvement . </s>
in the case of unemployment benefit , we come across six restriction and five improvement . </s>
the reason for adjustment be , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but be also due to policy competition and EMU criterion . </s>
policy competition mainly occur in the northern country . </s>
the high level of stability and even improvement of social security can be find in the southern country . </s>
all in all , both side of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole . </s>
this be nothing to write home about and mean that the convergence strategy must focus on the good approach . </s>
To use a figure of speech , cappuccino be not always good for us . </s>
Mr President , I come from the same country and the same region as the rapporteur , Mr Andersson . </s>
in my constituency , there be deep scepticism about the Commission 's attempt at direction and control . </s>
if those who vote for Mr Andersson know that he be propose that social policy throughout Europe should be coordinate , that taxis should be harmonise and that the welfare system should be subordinate to the process of European Monetary Union , then they would protest vociferously and in no uncertain term . </s>
I be certain that most of them would vote for another party next time . </s>
certainly , Mr Andersson 's report contain many good concrete proposal , which I can entirely support . </s>
but I be critical of the global perspective on social security which characterise both the Commission 's communication and Mr Andersson 's report . </s>
they seem to believe that it be the commission which be the engine , centre and drive force of the process of change in Europe . </s>
just as Mr Prodi describe himself this morning as someone who bear the responsibility of the world on his shoulder , what we be encounter here be a top-down perspective upon social issue , from which the talk be of convergence and harmonisation . </s>
There be even an attempt to make us believe that social integration can be consider a common pan-European process . </s>
the reality be quite different . </s>
a socially integrate Europe be a distant Utopia which not even an all-powerful Commission can turn into a reality . </s>
great step have be take towards economic integration , and the process of political integration be now under way . </s>
but social integration be an entirely different type of process which presuppose cultural community and direct communication between people . </s>
the concept of a social Europe be a drawing-board product which be far remove from the real world . </s>
social policy be chiefly a national process . </s>
in my own country , we have learn that large part of the social security system have to be create locally within the framework of the municipality . </s>
decentralisation and closeness to the people they serve be important factor for promote quality and efficiency within health care , education and social service . </s>
the municipality have responsibility for deliver almost all welfare service . </s>
local democracy provide the framework for social security . </s>
now that we have economic coordination , I certainly believe we need to increase the degree of coordination of social policy , too , at European level . </s>
but a European strategy for coordination must be base upon local initiative and upon diversity . </s>
it must have democratic support and respect the principle of closeness to the people . </s>
I belong to a party which , once upon a time , believe in central control , five-year plan and far-reaching convergence requirement . </s>
we be horribly wrong , and history force us to ask question of ourselves , to reconsider , and to revise our idea about democracy . </s>
I do not believe that the chief responsibility can lie with Mr Prodi and his Commission . </s>
I be convince that this must be bear by those people who be directly affect by the social problem concern . </s>
Mr President , I would , in turn , like to congratulate both the Commission , for make another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he have compile . </s>
the European Union 's policy encompass social policy in addition to economic and employment policy . </s>
so far , social policy have remain limited in term of set-up and resource . </s>
but under the influence of the free movement of employee , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour market be actually begin to become integrated . </s>
this have undeniable repercussion on social protection which be tie in with labour to a large extent . </s>
cross-border worker , employee on secondment and migrate employee , as well as job-seeker , student on placement and other student , experience hindrance in exercise the right of free movement . </s>
this be due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in term of social protection . </s>
in fact , the same phenomenon occur in tax law . </s>
in order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dump , the Commission have , in my opinion , develop a well-balanced approach which steer a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention . </s>
on the one hand , binding and enforceable rule apply to equal pay or additional old-age pension and on the other hand , programme be use to offer incentive with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion . </s>
base on a number of recommendation , report and communication , the Commission have make another step in the convergence process by set out objective and by set up a work party of high-ranking official . </s>
both proposal have already be accept by the Council and it be thus a matter of endorse this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time , with knowledge of all fact and / or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union . </s>
indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the age population , individualisation and change in family situation render such reorganisation inevitable . </s>
deny that such shift take place be tantamount to surrender social protection . </s>
with regard to eurosceptics and nationalist , I would say that social protection within the boundary of a Member State be not social and offer no protection . </s>
indeed , if social protection be to be phase out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor . </s>
and less social protection mean less purchasing power , few healthy employee and few happy employee . </s>
in respect of the super-Europeans , I would say that European social protection be neither attainable nor desirable . </s>
the discrepancy between the Member States be too immense in term of provision , rightful claimant , revenue or benefit , etc . </s>
it be thus impossible to bring all States into line . </s>
the path which the Commission be walk be , in fact , obvious . </s>
it have the advantage of clarity , and it can collect datum and exchange experience in order to agree on objective and finely tune solid , comparative indicator and put forward recommendation . </s>
I endorse this view . </s>
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter . </s>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent contribution , which add great value to the Commission 's initiative . </s>
in spite of the scepticism of some people , there be consensus on the need for a concerted strategy for modernise social protection . </s>
the discussion that be hold in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrate the importance of social transfer . </s>
more than @card@ % of people in the Union receive benefit that be not part of pension . </s>
Denmark and the Netherlands be positive example of the effort for cohesion that we must all make . </s>
in those two country , over @card@ % of people at risk live above the poverty line , whereas in the Southern country , only 7 % to15 % of poor people manage to do so . </s>
this fact create the imbalance in society and in competition that have already be highlight . </s>
the convergence criterion have create the temptation to reduce public spending , a phenomenon which have lead to anti-European feeling . </s>
the truth be that high level of protection coexist well with the good indicator of productivity . </s>
nevertheless , where social policy be concern too , a strategy for convergence which the report be advocate will benefit both the public and the success of the internal market . </s>
all system face new problem and these be identify in the report . </s>
the demographic issue be central , but the follow be not minor issue : new form of work , mobility within the Union and a short working life - young people start work later now and although the legal age for retirement be @card@ , in practice , people be retire between the age of @card@ and @card@ , due to restructuring in industry . </s>
in addition to this , poverty be an ever-present phenomenon , particularly for retire woman because their salary and contribution have be low . </s>
these challenge must be respond to as a matter of urgency . </s>
we be happy to welcome the Portuguese Presidency 's initiative , which be to establish a high-level group which we want to be the preparation for action for legislation and for programming , not just another postponement or a simple diagnosis of the problem . </s>
we need common objective with a realistic timetable . </s>
Mr President , Mr Andersson 's report contain a lot that be of interest . </s>
unfortunately , what be most interesting be that the report , which purport to be concern with a combined strategy for modernise social policy , instead propose an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere . </s>
social policy need to be renew in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States . </s>
even though the socialist , now that there be so many social democratic government , talk much less about unemployment than they use to , the unemployment in question be still high , and this in spite of the trade boom . </s>
something must be do so that unemployment do not turn the so-called European model into a parody . </s>
social policy must facilitate employment , create incentive for employer and employee to , respectively , provide and accept job . </s>
Mr Andersson 's report demand social convergence , that be to say that system should be increasingly standardise within and throughout the Eu . </s>
the Eu should apparently adopt what be call real convergence criterion , which would be binding and of real effect . </s>
Mr Andersson also want to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination , that be to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere . </s>
the Eu should also , on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty threshold , table recommendation concern what be call the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States . </s>
the Eu should devise guideline govern the quality of the job opportunity which be to be create , whatever that may mean . </s>
it be certainly not go to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulation and form of interference . </s>
those structural problem which make unemployment high in Europe than in the United States will become even great . </s>
There be no need at all for supranationalism in this area . </s>
the Member States can devise their own system in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resource and political preference . </s>
it be most especially important not to create unnecessary problem before the enlargement of the Eu . </s>
Mr Andersson think that the less wealthy eastern country should be remind that social convergence be to apply to them too . </s>
it be obvious , however , that these country , impoverish within a communist economic system , can cope with a social policy like , for example , Sweden 's . </s>
talk of minimum regulation and poverty threshold be meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant state be concern . </s>
Mr President , as other have do , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he have produce . </s>
he have do a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in produce a wide-ranging consensus on what be , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State . </s>
I also welcome the Commission 's communication . </s>
it be slow in come but well worth wait for . </s>
it could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , provide we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the step that must be take to implement it . </s>
we can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which be globalising fast . </s>
I be afraid the proposal that be be put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world . </s>
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broad sense , be integrate and that we deal with them as a whole . </s>
we have to ensure that our ECOFIN minister and our employment minister acknowledge that social affair minister have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which be creative , have initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizen . </s>
this be not an option for us any more . </s>
it be an imperative . </s>
European citizen will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befit them as human being . </s>
we do not want the US model - a model which have spectacularly fail to create the employment that be necessary to provide a decent quality of life . </s>
What it have do be increase dramatically the number of work poor in the United States . </s>
that be not what we want to do in Europe . </s>
we have the tradition of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a good way of do thing . </s>
but we have to grasp the tool to do that . </s>
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as propose by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , this be one of the social area to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention . </s>
macroeconomic policy , the stability pact and the criterion for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernise social protection which would improve the quality of people 's life , specifically by mean of a significant increase in pension and pension scheme , particularly of the minimum pension , and through fight social exclusion . </s>
this situation be particularly serious in country such as Portugal where the minimum pension and pension scheme be barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , be the low in the whole of Europe . </s>
therefore , while the Commission do not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policy to create more job of quality , with employee right , which be a fundamental basis for maintain and modernise a solid , public social protection system , we harbour serious doubt as to its position . </s>
although the Andersson report have gather some positive proposal , include some that we put forward ourselves , we be still critical of some of the base for the Commission 's proposal and we still have concern about the strategy for modernise social protection . </s>
Mr President , in my previous life I run two manufacturing business , one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands . </s>
as the UK business grow , we invest in more people , as the Dutch business grow we invest in more machinery . </s>
the simple reason for this be that social cost in the Netherlands be just too high in comparison . </s>
I be in favour of social protection , I be in favour of the original Commission document , but I do not want to see people price out of job because social protection cost become unrealistically high . </s>
that be why in committee I propose some form of business impact assessment , so that cost and risk to job could be take into account , and the EPP-DE Group support this amendment . </s>
but I must record that other group , lead by the PSE Group , guide by my countryman , Stephen Hughes , vote this out . </s>
I accept that Mr Andersson 's report be very well-intentioned , and I respect him for the work he have do , but in my view the way the report define and promote social convergence would drive social cost high throughout the Eu . </s>
this would put more job at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by show how remote we be from the real world . </s>
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal , which be very well-balanced , stand unamended . </s>
Mr President , we be unable to vote for this report . </s>
the European Union should actually place social issue at the heart of the building of Europe . </s>
social right should determine economic choice , and not the other way around . </s>
this be why , when it come to social protection , we be oppose to scheme copy from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale : broad economic guideline , then convergence criterion and , finally , social issue , deal with as the last resort . </s>
the European Union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social right acquire in Member States may not be restrict . </s>
any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantee accord to the high common denominator . </s>
in order to strengthen the funding of social security system , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State . </s>
in order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment be inalienable right . </s>
finally , in order to avoid health be treat in any way as a commodity , the European Union should declare itself clearly oppose to pension fund and to a situation where private insurance company have access to the health system . </s>
I sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social Europe can be satisfy with mere word and pious hope . </s>
for million of people the situation be too tragic for that . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the aim of develop a coordinate strategy for modernise social protection in the European Union be certainly an admirable one . </s>
just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policy at the Luxembourg Summit be commendable . </s>
the labour market and social protection be , in fact , two side of the same coin , that require harmonise policy and rule . </s>
if the labour market function by mean of certain level of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it be impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa . </s>
until recently , the European country fix , it could be say in an autarkic way , the rule govern the functioning and financing of the two market . </s>
budgetary and exchange rate policy be responsible for maintain internal and external stability . </s>
with the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline become tight and recourse to devaluation cease as a means of endeavour to restore marginal competitiveness . </s>
the structural and economic difference of the various country can , therefore , be rebalance through budget deficit and trade . </s>
that be the case , in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union , and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level , it be leave to the labour market and welfare system to provide what degree of flexibility there be to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria , the so-called exogenous asymmetric shock . </s>
and therein lie the paradox . </s>
political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entail convergence of the respective rule of the game in the labour market and welfare system . </s>
but , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non-convergence in term of salary and welfare , in order to compensate for the difference in marginal productivity at national and regional level . </s>
hypocrisy and fine-sounding word such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action be not go to extricate us from those contradiction . </s>
either the European Union become a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resource , genuine free movement of worker and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regime , or it would be well not to deceive and be deceive by hopeless path to convergence which sound impressive but which , in reality , only cause harm , above all to the most vulnerable . </s>
that be something we would do well to recognise . </s>
Mr President , unlike several of those who have speak in today 's debate , I be incline to endorse the Andersson report , one of the reason for this being that I can see clear difference between the report and the Commission 's communication . </s>
in particular , I be refer to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defend the European social model 's approach , which be one base on solidarity . </s>
I would like to highlight the clear position adopt against social dump , together with the right to a basic level of social security , the goal of social convergence , and , in particular , the quite specific point that have be make about equal opportunity for woman be the primary objective of this social policy . </s>
I can certainly see that it have its shortcoming in fail to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union , and it be this policy which stand in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state , model . </s>
all in all , though , I deem this report to be worthwhile . </s>
Mr President , I have take the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which be much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe . </s>
this message be contain in the excellent report by Mr Andersson . </s>
Europe , the European Union , although it be very strong in economic and political term , will remain shaky , weak and limited , perhaps inadequate , if we be not able to strengthen it from a social point of view . </s>
I believe that the latter mean the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged . </s>
bear in mind that everybody have the right to social protection and a minimum guarantee social income , I believe that we must not forget about those people who be not bear in the European Union . </s>
let us not forget that , in @card@ , @card@ people come here to compensate for our low birth rate . </s>
in social term , it be therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as President Gutierres recently state in Spain . </s>
we must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospect of find work be threaten or reduce by economic change , merger , take-overs , new technology etc . </s>
What be require here be a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new job , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film state , the postman always ring twice . </s>
in my humble opinion , it be the responsibility of all European , national and regional government to ensure that he ring on more than one occasion . </s>
it seem to me , Commissioner , that the Commission have the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunity . </s>
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work , which be the reason why there be broad agreement , and I also thank the member of Parliament involve for their contribution . </s>
I would like to make a number of comment about what have be say . </s>
first , I must stress that the debate about social protection issue begin several year ago among the European body and since @card@ there have be the first statement entitle : &quot; the future of social protection &quot; and there have be statement from the European Parliament , those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk . </s>
today , we have the statement by Mr Andersson . </s>
I believe we have make considerable progress since we be now talk about the modernisation of social protection . </s>
the second point be that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate . </s>
you know very well that the Treaty provide no legal basis for policy at European level , but there be the agreement express at the last council , there be agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience , as well as the exchange of successful programme between the Member States . </s>
the third observation be that as regard the four issue on which the specific statement focus , which relate to pay work , the sustainability of pension system , social convergence and lastly quality in health care , there be a horizontal approach to the issue of woman because in each of these category - as the speaker say - there be special problem relate to woman and those problem should in many case be address by separate policy . </s>
the next point concern the specific action we have undertake . </s>
as you know , a high-level group have already be set up by the Portuguese Presidency , which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency have focus on two thing : sustainable pension system and social accession . </s>
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at parliamentary level be very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the say high-level group . </s>
concern some remark about the role of social protection system , the cost of social protection and the part play by those system in the competitiveness of the Member States , I should like to say that in Europe policy strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion . </s>
of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be plan in a way that make it a factor of economic growth and employment . </s>
I think the statement 's content make this clear . </s>
lady and gentleman , the aim be that in the next year , and after a unanimous decision by the Council , we should progress to a first level of coordination , exchange of view , list of social problem and creation of a datum base for the good coordination of policy . </s>
as many of the speaker have say , I believe a first important step have be take . </s>
already at the Intergovernmental Conference , social policy issue be be address more broadly and I believe we be in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a European policy . </s>
thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ a. m. WIPO treaty the next item be the recommendation ( A5-0008 / @card@ ) by Mrs Cederschiöld , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval , on behalf of the European Community , of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0222 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( AVC ) ] . </s>
Mr President , we be now take a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospect for prosperity of many Member States . </s>
in my own country , Sweden , one of our big export industry be affect , namely the music and sound recording industry . </s>
it be about artist ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic product . </s>
it be about the WCT ( World Copyright Treaty ) and the WPPT ( World Performance and Phonograms Treaty ) . </s>
without protection under intellectual property law , creativity be inhibit and financial incentive obstruct . </s>
forgery be big business . </s>
it be estimate that , in Europe alone , income of EUR @card@ billion be lose because of piracy . </s>
the problem affect a lot of job in the entertainment industry . </s>
this be an historic agreement because the Eu be the contracting party . </s>
this be the case , in spite of the fact that it be not the Eu , but only the Member States , which belong to the organisation . </s>
There exist a special clause which require Parliament 's assent in two case . </s>
with regard to the present agreement , both these condition be fulfill . </s>
a new institution be be create , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequence . </s>
the agreement also concern question deal with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure . </s>
Parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concern its sphere of competence . </s>
the future will show whether it be right , by mean of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the Commission 's power regard these issue . </s>
Parliament can , in any case , at present do anything about the matter . </s>
the agreement complement the Berne Convention in regard to literary work . </s>
it create international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the make available of work . </s>
it also create protection for software and database . </s>
There be problem regard the term &quot; author &quot; . </s>
for example , it have not be define . </s>
another issue , which be somewhat problematic , be that of intermediate storage . </s>
this too have not be solve . </s>
it be deal with by mean of a general clause which do not provide any definition . </s>
if no definition be provide in question such as this , it can lead to their be deal with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach . </s>
that would not be a good thing . </s>
the question of arbitration procedure be still to be resolve , too . </s>
Parliament can change these detail . </s>
we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stand . </s>
yes or no to an agreement which contain deficiency . </s>
both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes . </s>
we have here an agreement which , in spite of its defect , constitute a significant step forward for the issue of copyright . </s>
we have of course discuss at length whether Parliament and whether the Eu should have power in regard to patent under intellectual property law . </s>
I think they should have . </s>
however , there be still no Community legislation in the area of patent law and protection of design , and there need to be . </s>
a European patent be in the offing , and that be a good thing . </s>
now , the Union and the Member States be combine to take the first step in the area of intellectual property law . </s>
it be good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we be not completely satisfy . </s>
in that way , we can act as a model for the applicant state . </s>
we have a direct financial interest in these issue be settle before enlargement . </s>
I want to thank the Commission for its effort in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission 's official , which have be quite excellent . </s>
finally , I also want to thank this Chamber for be so good as to listen to these word at this late hour . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Cederschiöld , on her very serious work . </s>
she have clearly identify the problem create by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation 's treaty . </s>
their approval be undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union be participate as a contracting party in an international treaty that govern the field of intellectual property . </s>
it be a fact that the road have be a long one , mainly because of the legal problem that arise in connection with the extent to which the Community could be consider to have absolute competence in matter of intellectual property . </s>
the problem have be overcome . </s>
today we be ask to give our assent in effect to two treaty : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretation , performance and phonogram . </s>
as regard the first of these , it seem to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demand by the creator of artistic and literary work , while at the same time create a framework of protection in relation to issue such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their work to the public . </s>
as regard the second treaty on performance and phonogram , it must be stress that for the first time an international treaty sign by the Community as well recognise exclusive right for performer , interpreter and artist for reproduction , distribution and rental to the public , and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcast . </s>
in that context a noteworthy and important step forward be the treaty 's treatment of the right of reproduction . </s>
even though , as the Commission say , the text of the treaty do not contain special provision to regulate all the respective issue raise by technological development , it can nevertheless be say that within the legislative framework create , perform or interpret artist enjoy broad protection than that accord by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directive . </s>
interpret Article 7 of the Treaty , we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction do not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretation or performance themselves as such that be embody in recording , but also protection against copying , whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary , and protection against any other form of production . </s>
it would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some point which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conference . </s>
first , there be the right of distribution as refer to in Article 8 ( 1 ) . </s>
the option accord to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right be dangerous and be one of the Treaty 's most negative point , since there be nothing to prevent state from enact special condition for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artist . </s>
as regard rental right , on interpretation of Article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belong to artist , interpreter or performer , only if this be lay down by national legislation . </s>
I think this conflict with Article @card@ . </s>
To conclude , I want to say that ratification of these treaty open a horizon for property right . </s>
in the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many case , be more important than traditional property . </s>
we be at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be create , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in term of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur . </s>
I believe she have touch on a few important point , which I intend to raise again myself very shortly . </s>
first and foremost , we be discuss Parliament 's assent to the aforementioned WIPO treaty . </s>
nothing be in force yet and so this time Parliament 's decision will carry some weight . </s>
in sign up , the Eu be act in accordance with its intention to arrogate all internal and international power , but it be unclear as to where the power withdraw from national control , be to end up . </s>
therefore assent will only be the order of the day here if the EP be involve in the development of WIPO law every step of the way , from start to finish , and have the right of codecision . </s>
this be not provide for in the Treaty of Amsterdam . </s>
What do the Commission have to say to that ? </s>
crucial aspect have remain unclear in the draft treaty , and the rapporteur say the same . </s>
To quote one example : the concept &quot; author &quot; be not define in any way in the Treaty , which would make the situation ripe for litigation amongst party to the Treaty . </s>
I would like to ask the Commission at this point if it intend to go into this with its eye shut ? </s>
do it intend to impose its own definition of copyright on other party to the Treaty ? </s>
in addition , the WIPO approach be base on the concept of individual right . </s>
this will lead to problem for indigenous people such as the Sami , for they have a different notion of right : that of collective right . </s>
however , there be also public interest at stake . </s>
for example , it be unclear as to whether public library will even be allow to loan book , video and cassette at no charge in the future . </s>
this would directly affect the individual 's right to equality of opportunity with regard to access to education . </s>
why do the Commission say nothing about this ? </s>
do it in fact want to privatise education ? </s>
economic interest be there in the large print of the treaty ; public interest , on the other hand , be there in very small print indeed . </s>
we have be conjure up image of the penniless poet , but what we be talk about here be the total marketing of the soundtrack of Titanic . </s>
furthermore , the relationship between WIPO and TRIPS have not be clarify , particularly as part of the two treaty overlap . </s>
one could now say : &quot; fine , trip , the difference be trade-related intellectual property , but WIPO be mainly about relevance to trade . </s>
therefore , how do we distinguish between these two treaty and ought there to be cooperation ? </s>
if so , what form should this take ? </s>
Should we set a precedent with WIPO so as to give the Eu complete control over trip too ? </s>
all in all , there be still a huge amount of room for improvement and clarification as far as the draft be concern . </s>
I expect the Commission to provide some information on the question that have be raise so that I can at least give an explanation of vote for my group . </s>
Mr President , I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , conclude that , as a Community , our accession to these two WIPO treaty must not boil down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i. e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together . </s>
this ratification be also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe . </s>
however , an objective be emerge behind this issue of Community accession , one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States , nonetheless , find too offensive . </s>
this be the affirmation of a European cultural policy . </s>
in this connection , I expect our three institution , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , to be in agreement . </s>
cultural policy mean , in particular , defend the role of the art , recognise the role of author and set high cultural standard . </s>
in addition , at a time when Europe face the task of define a new policy on copyright and neighbour right , there be an urgent need - as have just be point out several time - to define and redefine what exactly an author be . </s>
our definition be still too vague and new technology now make it essential for us to clarify them . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the adoption of the WIPO agreement be a very positive step in the direction of the global information society . </s>
the agreement crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely consider and balance solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbour right . </s>
the entry into force of the treaty and their final form be , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the party themselves . </s>
in the United States the WIPO Treaty have already enter into force , have be enact into law by mean of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have manage to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by mean of this legislation . </s>
the Eu too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what be agree in the WIPO . </s>
it be worry that the position adopt by the previous Parliament do not support this balanced WIPO system . </s>
the opinion on the copyright directive at first reading be very distort , and , furthermore , the balance be move in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans . </s>
the recommendation that have be make will not improve the status of culture in Europe , on the contrary . </s>
Parliament 's amendment would mainly improve opportunity for the medium enterprise that be well establish in the market to move their old , in excess of @card@ % market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulation . </s>
I be not now speak of Charlotte Cederschiöld 's recommendation , which be an excellent paper , but of the matter of copyright that the previous Parliament discuss . </s>
on one point of detail , I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for have clarify , for example , the concept of so-called temporary copy in her opinion . </s>
There be no consciously adopt position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copy . </s>
if these , which technically speak be copy , be cover by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly state - expensive and complicate for no good reason . </s>
it would be as if the deliveryman have to pay a copyright fee whenever he carry a book to be read by the purchaser . </s>
the real benefit of culture be that art and knowledge can be transfer safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer . </s>
the new operational environment be , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before . </s>
it be essential that the interest of all party be take into account . </s>
Parliament have try to take account of this in its own recommendation . </s>
Mr President , with regard to the protection of intellectual property right , the reality always seem to be ahead of the regulation . </s>
the evolution of the economy , the appearance of new form of contract and technological innovation be phenomenon which mean frequent and rapid change which must be take into account when draw up regulation . </s>
in this field , the process of produce regulation be slow , too slow , give the speed of the actual change which that legislation be intend to regulate . </s>
if this be the case , it be all the more obvious when the process involve multinational or supranational organisation , such as the WIPO , which have debate the treaty which we be propose to rectify . </s>
in consider whether we be in favour of the ratification of these treaty , we may wonder whether they meet the most current need in that field . </s>
it would be difficult to reply in the affirmative . </s>
There be no doubt that these treaty update the regulation in this field , but neither be there any doubt that there be currently many problem which they do not resolve . </s>
the recent inclusion of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the Internet and the appearance of virtual library have demonstrate that there be still many problem to be resolve . </s>
for example , the solution adopt by one of the most significant virtual library - which , by the way , belong to my own university , the University of Alicante - which consist of not include work still protect by copyright , imply a considerable limitation to the development of this type of virtual library . </s>
moreover , ratify these treaty now be go to be of little relevance . </s>
on the one hand , the problem which it aim to resolve have already be resolve to a large extent by mean of the directive on the harmonisation of certain aspect of copyright and related right in the information society . </s>
on the other hand , the majority of the Member States have already adapt their legislation to the treaty which be now be ratify . </s>
I must finally point out that the legislative amendment introduce in a number of country , such as Spain , have resolve some conflict but have lead to other which be commonly find when it come to put a price on right and material . </s>
in such a sensitive field , we must find solution which balance the different interest involve . </s>
only in this way will the regulation be accept . </s>
. </s>
( NL ) Mr President , I would like to start by congratulate the rapporteur on the work that she have carry out . </s>
the Commission be under the impression that she have work fast and effectively . </s>
this be important . </s>
it befit the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur . </s>
I would like to present the Commission 's conclusion to you without any further ado : it agree with the conclusion of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this Parliament . </s>
I would like to stress the importance of both treaty . </s>
both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbour right and be , as such , a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome . </s>
both treaty contribute towards a high level of protection for work and other matter , but offer the public access to the content of these via electronic network . </s>
the two treaty explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the treaty and to play an important role in manage them . </s>
consequently , approval of the treaty by the Community be of major importance , because it illustrate that the Community set great store by intellectual property right . </s>
in addition , assent lead to more widespread international recognition of the European Union 's role in term of copyright . </s>
at international level , there be a great deal of support for treaty enter into force more swiftly . </s>
these have now be ratify by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States , include the United States . </s>
the entry into force of treaty largely depend on the European Union , because thirty ratification act be require in order for treaty to enter into effect , and these act that be sign by the European Union and the Member States , include associate country , be of vital importance in order to reach this number . </s>
the develop country , too , expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide . </s>
in this context , Parliament have already play a key role in the discussion on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society , which lead to the approval of the Barzanti report in February @card@ . </s>
this directive be the necessary counterpart of the propose decision and largely embrace the key principle of the WIPO Treaties . </s>
the European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article @card@ ( 3 ) . </s>
it be vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world , in the form of this recommendation . </s>
in a nutshell , I would like to reiterate the Commission 's conclusion here : it support the draft recommendation and hope that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a . </s>
M. ( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) adoption of the Minutes of the previous sit the Minutes of yesterday be sit have be distribute . </s>
be there any comment ? </s>
Mr President , I see in the Minutes that two member speak yesterday about delayed flight to Strasbourg on Monday . </s>
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam 's Schipol airport be also delay and then cancel . </s>
we be divert to Basel-Mulhouse Airport . </s>
we be tell that a bus would meet us there on arrival . </s>
in fact , it take @card@ minute after we arrive before the bus appear at the airport . </s>
we finally get here , on Monday at @card@ p. m. , after some of us have spend more than @card@ hour travel . </s>
this sort of service and difficulty in get to Strasbourg on a Monday be quite hopeless . </s>
if the French government insist that we continue to meet in Strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flight be divert to Basle , that bus arrive on time to meet the divert passenger , otherwise it be quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business . </s>
I wonder if that could be add to the Minutes . </s>
Mr President , I be book on the same flight and I be rather embarrass to admit that the airline be KLM , our national airline company . </s>
I hope that next time , also if any other airline company be involve , thing will run more smoothly . </s>
( the Minutes be approve ) Mr President , I would just like to draw your attention to something that concern today 's agenda . </s>
we decide on Monday that the Council 's statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention be to be postpone . </s>
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talk about the other item on this agenda today , and not about the Geneva Convention . </s>
this item have be postpone until the next part-session in March . </s>
it be erroneously include in today 's agenda . </s>
Mr Swoboda , I can confirm what you have just say and there be , in fact , a printing error . </s>
the document that have be distribute contain inaccuracy , because the decision have be take to postpone the debate . </s>
Mr President , I just want to say that , as I be walk in this morning , I notice two people smoke outside the hemicycle . </s>
the smell be absolutely disgusting ! </s>
Can you please do something about it ? </s>
I can do anything about it myself , but you be quite right . </s>
we need a quick way of educate people , include those who do not obey the rule decide upon in this House . </s>
regard the problem cause by air travel delay , perhaps everybody who have have difficulty reach Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I be not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problem encounter . </s>
coherence of Eu policy with development the next item be the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of Eu policy with development . </s>
Mr President , it be a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament be bind to play in the near future , give the need to strengthen development policy at European Union level . </s>
the subject of the statement that I have the honour of present to you today , be the coherence of different Union policy with development policy . </s>
I shall , of course , give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observation that I shall be make . </s>
I would like to start by emphasise the need we all feel , at Eu level , to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have see in many area of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent year , which have benefit people in all walk of life , throughout the world , in term of well-being and improvement in live condition - with the fact that , at the same time , there have be a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalance between some region and geopolitical area of the world . </s>
this endanger the stability of the international system and jeopardise peace . </s>
we be all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policy good to this objective of achieve great stability and great balance in the various part of our planet . </s>
the consequence of all this be a reassessment of development policy in response to the globalisation of economic and financial market . </s>
a serious imbalance in the functioning of these market have emerge , which have of course make it necessary to make important adjustment , which in turn inevitably mean new option as regard development policy . </s>
we will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policy which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential area : firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international player , by which I mean donor , require great coordination , great coherence and improve link between humanitarian aid and development policy ; it will also require strengthen of the multilateral system and great attention be pay to indebtedness and to financing and development problem . </s>
at the same time , however , there will have to be some change in the framework within which those country now receive aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principle in develop their political system , together with a need to focus special attention on these country ' own policy for reduce poverty . </s>
the second aspect of this new model for development policy relate to the need for a more integrated approach to development . </s>
this mean not just an approach limit to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly take account of the role of other policy in the sphere of finance , trade and investment . </s>
furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approach both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor country ' own policy . </s>
a third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise be a policy aim at achieve our objective . </s>
since @card@ , follow a concerted international effort between the main donor state , involve in particular a reflection paper produce by the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee , it have be possible to establish some important objective by way of guideline for development policy , both at national and international level . </s>
as you will know , the aim of these objective be to cut poverty by @card@ % by @card@ , by increase compulsory schooling , by significantly reduce child mortality rate , and by implement a raft of social welfare measure with a view to effectively achieve this objective . </s>
this would mean move away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world 's population life , and move away from the extremely poor living condition suffer by over a billion people . </s>
this be an extraordinary state of affair , which certainly mean that if this objective be to be achieve the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively . </s>
and that bring me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise . </s>
particularly in recent year , development policy have be regard as an increasingly global matter , and yet there be apparently a lack of strong international leadership . </s>
the concerted action of the United Nations institution have play an important role here , as have the Bretton Woods system . </s>
I have in mind , in particular , the important impetus give to this debate by the World Bank , especially through its Comprehensive Framework document , and by the International Monetary Fund , where , for the first time , an institution of this kind have put the problem of reduce poverty at the centre of its policy guideline and have forge a hitherto unimaginable link , for a body of this type , between debt relief and poverty . </s>
this new role for international organisation on development issue be also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European union in this context . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency have highlight the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a lead role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policy , and to create great scope for coordination , in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system . </s>
if we be to strengthen the European Union 's role in international development policy , we believe that it be basically necessary to take three kind of action . </s>
firstly , we need to make the Eu 's development policy more effective . </s>
as you know , an exercise be carry out in @card@ involve an overall assessment of development policy , and the result of this overall assessment exercise be present during the German Presidency . </s>
the main conclusion emphasise the need for a more coherent Eu policy and a more strategic overall Eu approach to development issue . </s>
the key aspect be the need for great coordination and great complementarity between policy , the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union 's present cooperation policy , the need to make the Eu 's aid management more efficient and , in particular , to review its mechanism for intervention , and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce great transparency into the process for grant aid . </s>
a second aspect worth highlight underscore the need for Eu policy and the policy of the Member States to complement each other more . </s>
it be widely know that a significant proportion of aid be today grant under the Member States ' national policy , which be not always complementary or well coordinate . </s>
a great deal of the waste and inefficiency associate with aid from the European Union and its Member States be the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the action of individual Member States and the proposal and action of the European institution . </s>
in this respect it be also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create strong mechanism for ensure that the policy adopt by the Member States and European Union policy be coordinate and complementary . </s>
the third aspect I would like to highlight be the strengthening and coherence of Eu policy , the central theme of today 's debate . </s>
firstly , we be all aware that it be not enough just to improve aid condition and that there be a need for good coordination with other European Union policy , so that development objective can be achieve , not merely through aid and support , but also , first and foremost , through a more integrated approach to the various different policy that contribute to the objective of development . </s>
as you know , a Council Resolution be approve , in June @card@ , under which the Commission be require to present evaluation report . </s>
the first such report be present to the Council in May @card@ , and it refer to certain aspect of policy coordination , notably in the field of peace building , food safety , fishery and migration . </s>
but as you will also be aware , we be wait for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy . </s>
over the come month , that be to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enrich by the contribution that the Commission have undertake to present to us . </s>
it be evident that the scope for achieve coherence between policy will always be limit and it be only natural for there to be some contradiction between policy as these be mean of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interest within the European Union . </s>
only in this way be it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policy . </s>
but , quite apart from this , we would like to emphasise that , if we be to strengthen the coherence of European Union policy in the present circumstance and in the economic situation currently face the Union , we need to give serious consideration to various issue associate with the dynamics of the European Union itself . </s>
by this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union . </s>
we know that the European Union have its own dynamics , which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam , which have reinforce its political dimension . </s>
this inevitably have important consequence for the proposal for coherence in policy relate to development . </s>
we will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regard enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union be direct towards increase the coherence of its policy , and , as regard development in particular , to what extent it also contribute to appropriate institutional arrangement for achieve this objective . </s>
the second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policy , be development policy in the context of the Union 's foreign policy . </s>
we know that the Union have enter a new era as regard its foreign policy , and we know that , with the creation of the High Representative , of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity , there be a whole trend towards confirm the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policy . </s>
we also know that there be issue associate with political dialogue , with the adoption of common position or joint action , with the preparation of joint strategy , with preventive diplomacy , and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management . </s>
There can be no doubt that implement and develop all these aspect will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthen the role of development policy in the context of the European Union 's foreign policy . </s>
it have to be say that , in approach development policy in the context of foreign policy , the European Union be bind to go down the same road as many Member States have do with their own development policy in the context of their individual foreign policy . </s>
the success of this be bind to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanism and institutional structure relate to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure good coordination between instrument of development policy and instrument of foreign policy . </s>
in this context , we be convince that we need to move away from the post ­ colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid . </s>
I say this because we know that , in Europe , development policy have be very much shape by the policy of certain Member States , in view of the post-colonial concern of those state . </s>
the third aspect that need to be consider be European Union policy and Member States ' policy . </s>
coherence of policy at European level certainly mean good coordination of Member States ' policy with the European Union 's development policy . </s>
if we do not establish improve mechanism to ensure coherence between national policy , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of great coherence in European Union development policy . </s>
lady and gentleman , the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention , regard development policy , be , of course , the Development Council . </s>
There have be discussion , especially in recent month , about the role the Development Council could play in relation to Eu policy . </s>
as you know , there be a glaring difference between the status of development policy and other Eu policy - you only have to look at the difficult circumstance surround the EDF 's financing , or rather lack of financing . </s>
it be difficult to imagine achieve great coherence in the European Union 's policy without the Development Council play a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decision , which clearly come under the development banner and which be be deal with in other council , in other decision-making forum , range from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council . </s>
up to now , the Development Council have not have any opportunity to make its voice hear or to intervene in relation to these decision . </s>
so without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impact on the European Union 's development policy , be largely be deal with outside this decision-making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objective . </s>
the view of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome . </s>
. </s>
let me start by say something about the successfully conclude negotiation between the Eu and ACP country . </s>
I would like to remark that it be a very positive experience take part in those negotiation . </s>
I see Member States work as a team , which be indeed a wonderful experience . </s>
There be also deep satisfaction on both side when this be over , not just because it be over , but because we all know that we have achieve something together , the Eu and the @card@ ACP country . </s>
that be something that the world need and be a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation . </s>
I shall outline some of the major innovation in the new agreement . </s>
we explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for deal with the problem of immigration for the first time ever . </s>
we promote participatory approach , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reform and policy to be support by the Eu . </s>
we refocus development policy on poverty reduction strategy . </s>
we base the allocation of fund not only on an assessment of each country 's need , but also of its policy performance . </s>
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector . </s>
we rationalise instrument and introduce a new system of roll programming , allow the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme . </s>
we decentralise administrative and , in some case , financial responsibility to local level with the aim of make cooperation more effective . </s>
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development . </s>
we enhance cooperation in all area important to trade , include new issue such as labour standard and the linkage between environment and trade . </s>
after Seattle I be sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreement . </s>
let me turn to some of the more important point . </s>
firstly the agreement on political issue . </s>
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both side to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoy active Community support . </s>
secondly , a new procedure have be draw up for case of violation of human right , democratic principle and the rule of law . </s>
in comparison with the current procedure , the new one put more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concern and allow for great flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conduct an effective dialogue lead to measure to be take to redress the situation . </s>
in case of special urgency involve serious violation of one of these essential element , measure will be take immediately and the other party will be notify . </s>
thirdly , the Eu and the ACP have also agree on a new specific procedure to be launch in serious case of corruption . </s>
this be a real innovation , both in the EU / ACP context and in international relation in general . </s>
this procedure will be apply , not only in case of corruption involve EDF money , but also more widely in any country where the EC be financially involve and where corruption constitute an obstacle to development . </s>
it be thus not confine to EC activity . </s>
this be a very important aspect , take into account the fundability of public finance . </s>
by adopt such a provision in the partnership agreement , the Eu and the ACP States be together send a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciate by European taxpayer and hopefully also by European investor . </s>
another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement be migration . </s>
we have reach a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area . </s>
this new dimension to the partnership agreement reflect the guideline espouse by the Eu in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusion of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October @card@ . </s>
the European Union undertake to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy found on the principle of partnership with the originate country and region . </s>
the agreement conclude with the ACP country pave the way for new initiative , in particular on the right of third country citizen within the Eu , and measure facilitate their integration . </s>
we also agree on provision to address question relate to illegal immigration . </s>
the Eu and the ACP state will initiate the process aim ultimately at define , within a framework to be negotiate with each and every ACP country , the way and mean of repatriate immigrant illegally present on the territory of each party . </s>
this also cover person from third country and stateless person . </s>
these very innovative approach provide a good opportunity to improve governance . </s>
the agreement also offer a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforce effect of trade cooperation and development aid . </s>
we have agree on a process to establish new trading arrangement that will pursue trade liberalisation between the party and to formulate provision on trade-related matter . </s>
we have meet the concern of the ACP state as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiation be concern . </s>
negotiation will start no later than @card@ . </s>
this two-year preparatory period will be use to strengthen regional integration process and the ACP country ' capacity to conduct trade negotiation . </s>
a six-year period be programme for these negotiation . </s>
we will take account of the economic and social constraint of the ACP country in two way : firstly , through human and social development policy to accompany economic and trade reform and , secondly , by help the ACP state to become active player in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forum . </s>
this approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime . </s>
economic operator will be more incline to establish close relation with their ACP partner . </s>
domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transfer , all of which will boost the ACP country ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy . </s>
in addition , the agreement with the Eu will act as an anchor . </s>
they will lock in the economic reform , just as national and economic reform will be stabilise by both party ' commitment under the agreement . </s>
the rationale behind this new approach be also base on the idea that open trade policy combine with social development policy will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction . </s>
another important aspect be the improvement of the Eu 's trade regime for all least-developed country , @card@ of which be actually in the ACP group . </s>
this process will take place in the come five year so that , by @card@ , the LDC ' exporter will have free access for essentially all their product on the Eu market . </s>
as regard the volume of the next EDF , the Eu have make its financial proposal . </s>
it be base on the principle of reconcile the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resource in a period of limited official development assistance budget with the need to make Community aid more effective . </s>
today about EUR @card@ billion of previous EDF resource be uncommitted . </s>
the Eu be commit to mobilise these remain balance , plus the new EDF resource , over a seven-year period , that be to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol . </s>
this will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flow of commitment and payment during this period . </s>
we be thus not move into a period in the come year of reduce activity , we be move into a period of increase activity . </s>
such a commitment entail an in-depth reform of procedure and implementation modality on both side . </s>
There be a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which be the basis of the deal with the ACP country . </s>
turn to our development policy , I would say that the global context have change drastically . </s>
the marginalisation of many economy , increase poverty in the world , the need for good management of environmental interdependence , the destabilising effect of migration and the worry consequence of armed conflict and pandemic disease be all major concern . </s>
it be within this change global framework that we have to position ourselves . </s>
fortunately evaluation of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we be do and also hopefully to meet the challenge I have just mention . </s>
To focus on the input come from the evaluation , I would mention the follow problem : the objection of Community policy be too numerous and too vague and this adversely affect coherence . </s>
this be due to the complexity of our own structure , but also to very real inconsistency between sector policy and interest in the Member States . </s>
the Commission have an aid system that be too complex and fragmented in term of instrument , procedure and institutional mechanism . </s>
often policy be more determine by the instrument available , than by policy objective and clearly-defined priority . </s>
human resource be too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we be suppose to manage . </s>
on average , to manage $ US @card@ million of aid there be @card@ staff at the Commission , compare with @card@ at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States . </s>
this be a real problem : there be too many different financial instrument , each with its own characteristic and in particular a series of different budget heading . </s>
this be difficult to reconcile with the need of an effective management system . </s>
in order to face and solve these problem the community need to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament . </s>
it be absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which mean hold the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that be , the Council and Parliament . </s>
the lack of concerted action among the @card@ Member state themselves and between them and the Community also need to be address . </s>
by focus the Community 's development policy on internationally agree target and strategy we will pave the way for good complementarity with the Member States . </s>
this be very much the line also just present by Minister Amado . </s>
when we talk policy nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence . </s>
this be part of the solution . </s>
we be in the process of formulate new policy guideline and we need to identify priority area for Community action . </s>
Everything have become more and more complex . </s>
this be also true of development cooperation . </s>
no single donor be in a position to address the whole spectrum of theme , range from macro-economic issue to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policy to a variety of new cross-cutting theme such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reform . </s>
it be important to find flexible mechanism that accommodate a division of labour accord to the expertise and capacity of the various donor in each develop country . </s>
this should be do at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policy for Community action . </s>
this be where we want to go . </s>
To identify the EC 's priority area of support , account have to be take of the Community 's specific feature in relation to the Member States and to international institution . </s>
I will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergy between aid and economic cooperation ; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interest ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and be able to do relatively large job compare to what individual Member States can normally do . </s>
also , our presence on the ground : basically , I find the big value we represent be the very fact that be a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we be see as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be . </s>
it be vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework . </s>
it be this dual challenge that the Commission have to take up , by frame in the month ahead a proposal for a general policy statement . </s>
we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the view of all the different party interested . </s>
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resource into participate actively and we invite everybody to participate . </s>
parallel to this we have also embark on the process of improve coherence and clarify and bring to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problem we be have in this respect . </s>
this will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we be do . </s>
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson . </s>
I be please that Mr Amado talk about the EDF . </s>
the problem , however , should not be seek within this Parliament or the Commission ; it be the council that need to make a decision on the EDF budget . </s>
this sermon , therefore , really belong in the Council . </s>
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson . </s>
he have talk extensively about the new Lomé Convention , although this be not really the topic of this morning 's meeting . </s>
we want to talk about coherence . </s>
this be the topic . </s>
ever since the early ninety , the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognise that this coherence of European policy be leave something to be desire , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other Eu policy . </s>
this problem have be highlight on several occasion , to whit in @card@ , in @card@ and @card@ . </s>
the example be all quote in a resolution which lie before us . </s>
I have raise question regard this issue for year now . </s>
in fact , the obligation for coherence of policy be even include in the Treaty of Amsterdam in @card@ . </s>
in @card@ , it be agree that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlight any improvement . </s>
but what have we see since then ? </s>
fine word , as be the case again today , but no report . </s>
it be too crazy for word , really . </s>
it be a fact that we be deal with contradictory policy . </s>
time and time again , good intention be formulate but nothing be implement . </s>
it be , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today . </s>
I would like to give you a few example to illustrate these contradiction . </s>
a number of develop country grow sugar cane for sugar production . </s>
in the Union , sugar be produce from sugar beet . </s>
in order to prevent this cheap sugar from the develop country from compete with the more expensive Eu sugar , a considerable import levy be impose on cane sugar . </s>
the result be that the export of cane sugar from the relevant country to the Union be significantly restrict . </s>
at the same time , we give these country an enormous amount of development aid . </s>
a Minister from one of the Caribbean island which produce sugar cane once tell me : if you just allow our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all . </s>
another example be cacao . </s>
the European Union intend to permit 5 % of alternative fat in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market . </s>
this could just as well be 0 % - the internal market would still be harmonise . </s>
by pitch the percentage level at 5 % , which be now likely to be the case , it be almost certain that hundred of thousand of small cacao farmer in develop country will be put at a disadvantage . </s>
it seem to be head this way nevertheless . </s>
What be we actually do then ? </s>
this be also typical of a policy which make citizen wonder what Brussels actually do ? </s>
it seem that European industry be more important here than our own principle , our own coherence and the interest of the develop country . </s>
There be also shocking example in term of sanction and embargo . </s>
why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma , where an elect President be imprison , parliament have be send home and some of the MP have be put in jail or even murder ? </s>
why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan , where a great deal of the fighting be still go on , with weapon , no less , fund by the oil company which be base in the same area where the refugee be ? </s>
the inconsistency be astonishing . </s>
here too , Mr Nielson mention another good example regard the new Lomé Convention . </s>
if the new Lomé Convention be simply put into operation , without eradicate all these inconsistency from the policy , the policy will then be build on shift sand - to use a biblical expression . </s>
the Council have quote example of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operation , in the fishery sector , migration and environment . </s>
Mr Nielson , what we be wait for be a good report on these inconsistency and a number of specific proposal to eliminate these from the policy . </s>
once again , all your fine example , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be build on shift sand and will not really come off the ground . </s>
this be also at the request of the citizen . </s>
we have be say this ourselves since back in @card@ : this be the topic of this debate . </s>
I hope the message strike home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contain measure . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , follow the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen , I believe that we have a number of representative here who all feel passionate about contribute to this debate . </s>
the topic touch the very core of the European Union . </s>
let me begin by specify precisely what we be debate . </s>
article @card@ , Title XX of the consolidated treaty of the European Union read as follow : &quot; the Community shall take account of the objective refer to in Article @card@ in the policy that it implement which be likely to affect develop country &quot; . </s>
What be the objective which each Eu policy need to take into account ? </s>
article @card@ specify these objective as &quot; sustainable economic and social development of the develop country , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them &quot; , the &quot; smooth and gradual integration of the develop country into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the develop country &quot; . </s>
Mr President , these be no arbitrary objective . </s>
these be article , statutory article , which form part of the European acquis establish by law with which the European institution and Member States must comply . </s>
every statutory article should , of course , not just be judge on its regularity , but also on the importance of its content . </s>
I be of the opinion - and luckily I be not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence be essential to every government which aim to be a credible servant of its citizen . </s>
the interest of the citizen be only serve by a credible and reliable government . </s>
this be important if the government want to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence be require in order to use the restricted mean efficiently . </s>
we should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really be . </s>
reality be obstinate . </s>
it be up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness . </s>
the government be oblige to show up any of its dilemma , and to show where , when and why , problem occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweep it all under the carpet . </s>
What we be talk about here today be not an issue which can be toy with at leisure . </s>
poverty in the third world be a harrow problem that demand urgent attention . </s>
it be only natural that we in Parliament guard the interest of our citizen , but it be also in the interest of our citizen to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety be pursue . </s>
this be a moral interest , a safety interest and be , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy . </s>
in whose interest be it really if European taxpayer ' money be use to support economic development in Namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmer in the same country be drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidy , finance by the same tax payer ? </s>
we be all act as if this be not really happen , but we all know that it be . </s>
it be not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our head in the sand . </s>
the general interest of policy coherence be , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament . </s>
this responsibility can only be bear by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation . </s>
What we need here be an integral approach . </s>
after the lucid and closely reason explanation of this approach present by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson , I would like to note that we be very much look forward to the proposal , not only by Mr Nielson , but by the entire Commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole . </s>
this be why we urge the Commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instrument . </s>
we need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem area for coherence . </s>
we need to make it evident which problem we be solve and which we have not yet solve . </s>
this be why I advocate a monitor centre for coherence which make this apparent . </s>
this be why we need to set up inter-service task group in the Commission , in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , if our neighbour 's roof be leak , we can lend him pot and pan to collect the water , but it be , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof . </s>
the crisis in last year 's Commission have be solve today , but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution . </s>
I would wish the Commissioner all the good in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council . </s>
Mr President , let us be clear from the outset : when it come to cooperation , coherence be far from be the watchword . </s>
the treaty provide for the European Union to help develop country to develop but , as the previous speaker have explain so well , there be various distortion to these declaration . </s>
the first area of incoherence be the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policy . </s>
this give rise to serious malfunction , because some Community programme duplicate national programme , whereas they might have help other project about which nothing be do . </s>
and let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States do nothing to help the country which they be supposedly help to develop . </s>
the second area of incoherence be aid to authoritarian regime . </s>
we state that good governance and an end to corruption be mandatory but we continue to pour hundred of thousand of euros into Swiss bank account via the portfolio of a number of Heads of State . </s>
the third area of incoherence be human right . </s>
we say that we want to protect human right . </s>
we encourage develop country to respect human right . </s>
we even adopt numerous resolution condemn every violation of human right . </s>
we ally ourselves with demonstration and international campaign . </s>
and yet , at the same time , we allow the arm trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious form of arm such as anti-personnel mine . </s>
nor do we do much to really prevent human right violation . </s>
the fourth area of incoherence in the European Union 's cooperation policy be this : how do you expect to help development by pillage the natural resource of the people you be help . </s>
the European Union must leave fish for local fisherman to feed local population instead of systematically destroy maritime resource through intensive fishery . </s>
we must leave raw material so that local manufacturer can process them . </s>
I will not even mention oil ; we be all aware of the policy of group such as Elf and Total in Africa . </s>
furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seed and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this be apparent during recent negotiation , we force ACP country to sign trip agreement . </s>
these agreement risk be extend to live organism , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmer in the south , at the hand of the multinational . </s>
and yet , and this be the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current treaty . </s>
on the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licence within the framework of the very same trip , despite the fact that this would allow develop country to produce their own medicine and halt the AIDS massacre . </s>
similarly , during the WTO negotiation , at a time when , to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report , &quot; the current trade liberalisation process have not yet bring significant benefit for large part of the population of develop country , especially the poor &quot; , the European Union continue to defend the liberalisation of trade and intend to put an end to the system of favour ACP country , albeit with a transitional period of several year , instead of strengthen it , especially for the poor country . </s>
the eighth area of incoherence be of a political and practical nature . </s>
we be always say think globally , act locally . </s>
and yet we disregard local development agency and prefer to negotiate with national government and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programme and southern NGOs . </s>
and what about agriculture and the environment ? </s>
still more problem , still more area of incoherence which I might have highlight , not to mention research , emigration or health . </s>
in short , we claim that we want to help develop country and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge run counter to that very objective . </s>
I say it again , the European Union 's cooperation and development policy be not coherent . </s>
and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament , the institution and the Commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy . </s>
Mr President , I feel that this debate be particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development be in general an important issue , but because it be also a topical one . </s>
Seattle be a failure , and north-south relation be in the spotlight for all the wrong reason . </s>
the meeting hold in that North American city demonstrate that globalisation be have seriously unbalanced and negative effect on poor country . </s>
the Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development be be hold right now in Bangkok , and be suffer the consequence of that failure . </s>
in the meantime , however , as have already be mention , the negotiation on the future of the Lomé Convention have be conclude . </s>
this go to show just how topical this subject be . </s>
we could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it have finally be agree to hold in Cairo in April . </s>
however , I would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably lead us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - be amiss with north-south relation , include those between the European Union and the less develop country . </s>
you only have to realise that the category of &quot; least develop country &quot; have grow from @card@ to @card@ country over the last @card@ year , and now represent @card@ % of the world 's population , yet this category only account for @card@ % of world export and @card@ % of world import or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich country have fall by around @card@ % since @card@ . </s>
furthermore , the recent Community budget cut in this area , for the present financial year , be part of this trend , as well as send an undesirable and misguided political message . </s>
Michel Camdessus , a fair man who be still director of the International Monetary Fund , say in his speech at the opening of the Unctad conference , and I be now quote , that the international community give with one hand and take away with the other . </s>
he be of course talk about the aid grant by develop country to less develop country . </s>
it may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he do indeed say this , and I hear it with my own ear . </s>
this comment certainly seem to me to reflect the current situation , and I accordingly wish to stress that it be vital to rethink north-south relation and break the mould . </s>
in particular , we need to reconsider the role of the European union in this area , as I be certain that one of the Union 's strategic objective must be to promote a new and more equitable world order . </s>
it be therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bear in mind the underlie approach and dominant interest on which it be base , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it be have on the less develop country , particularly in this context . </s>
a new agreement have be reach with the ACP country . </s>
this be a positive development in itself , especially give the pressure to terminate it and the fact that various Member States do not wish it to continue . </s>
we will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact term of this agreement in great depth , but meanwhile there be no doubt that the European negotiator be more timid and fail to live up to the proposal that we formulate at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement do include some new and innovative point . </s>
certain politically important aspect of the new partnership agreement will have contribute to these . </s>
this be without a doubt the result of a complex negotiate process in which both party make major concession , and this be certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade . </s>
but it be above all the result of a strong ACP group , which obviously find new courage follow the event in Seattle . </s>
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of look at these issue seem to be emerge , especially as regard trade , and it be certainly necessary to tackle this area . </s>
lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policy towards develop country . </s>
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspect , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive area such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health-related issue , and also field such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technology . </s>
this also apply to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policy and other Community policy , and also between both type of policy and corresponding policy originate in the Member States . </s>
we can simply forge ahead with something that in the past have show itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed . </s>
Mr President , have listen to the Council and the Commission today , I just have to look at my agenda . </s>
yes , it do say : ' coherence of different Union policy with development policy ' . </s>
but we have not hear a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing . </s>
we have be wait for a report on coherence for year . </s>
it ought to have be here in write today and , after have hear Mr Nielson 's speech , I can well imagine that he be up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission . </s>
I know that the Commissioner himself have some strong and extremely reasonable opinion on coherence , and these be what I should like to have hear express here today . </s>
because the joint motion for a resolution propose a range of effective mechanism for ensure coherence , I shall use the very short time allot to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely oblige the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect . </s>
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the Eu 's common agricultural policy have have on develop country : dump of beef in Sahel and South Africa , tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica . </s>
the example be , I hope , all well know . </s>
in any case , they be know all too well to the producer in the ACP country who be affect by these measure and who have to destroy their product because they can compete with EU-subsidised product . </s>
European taxpayer contribute EUR @card@ billion per year in support of agriculture in the Eu . </s>
this be money which be help to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the develop country , which account for @card@ % of the total work force there compare with @card@ % in the Eu . </s>
add to this the fact that the agricultural sector account for @card@ % of the develop country ' gross national product , compare with @card@ % in the Eu . </s>
There be neither coherence nor human decency here . </s>
why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ? </s>
Mr President , how policy decision be arrive at be surely fundamental . </s>
the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his foreign Secretary yesterday make statement on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council . </s>
they point out that the UK , France and Germany far exceed the other country of the European union at present in term of population . </s>
they then draw the conclusion that population size should be reflect in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto . </s>
be the council discuss this issue ? </s>
be it prepare to maintain a democratic veto base on population strength or be it still move towards a simple majority vote of Council member , rather than a vote reflect the population in Europe which they democratically represent ? </s>
have the UK representative indicate to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration have be give to it ? </s>
as this voting matter be vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration . </s>
How decision be make be all-important . </s>
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly . </s>
Mr President , I thank the Council and the Commission for their statement this morning , but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that be what the agenda say we be talk about . </s>
much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policy and development policy , I question whether today be the time to be hold it . </s>
however , the Council statement give me hope for the future . </s>
it be quite obvious to me , as someone who specialise in development policy , that there be many area where lack of coherence be dramatically affect develop nation . </s>
I will give some example shortly . </s>
however , I remind this house that , back in June @card@ , a Council resolution acknowledge the fact that there be a serious lack of coherence in some of the Eu policy in relation to its development cooperation policy . </s>
this be follow by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report , the first of which be to be discuss in @card@ . </s>
we still await the first report , and that be why I believe this debate be premature , as the Commission have little to say on coherence this morning . </s>
the area identify by the Council be specific area where policy coherence be particularly important , such as peace-building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fishery and immigration . </s>
some of these issue have be discuss in depth . </s>
I personally feel that issue such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution be very much the domain of African Heads of State , with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU act as arbiter . </s>
the issue that be really affect by lack of coherence be in area such agriculture , trade , environment and biodiversity , but herein lie the real problem : these be the highly sensitive area of policy within the European union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular . </s>
member of this House will have differ view , even within the same political party , depend on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on . </s>
There be area of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the member of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries . </s>
as a lack of coherence , one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk do , the export of milk product to Jamaica at price far below production cost there which have almost ruin the Jamaican dairy industry . </s>
we have beef export to southern Africa , to Namibia and South Africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland , so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union . </s>
remember too , some country block an agreement with South African trade for four year . </s>
if we simply import raw material from these develop country , rather than allow them the add-on value of produce their finished article in their own country , we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in help develop nation . </s>
I be not surprise the Commission be have trouble produce a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development . </s>
There be a natural resistance in the develop world to anything that would lower standard of living and create further unemployment . </s>
I wish the Commission well in its task of produce that basic document . </s>
Mr President , this morning 's debate be very important . </s>
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for have make a statement on the coherence of Community policy in relation to development , because this demonstrate a will to make policy in this area more effective . </s>
however , if we be simply carry out a diagnosis of the incoherence in our policy , we will end up totally frustrate and , furthermore , the result will be negative . </s>
as with the system of force which be study in basic physic , it make no sense to implement policy which will cancel each other out . </s>
the result of this absurd game be not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resource throw away in a pointless enterprise . </s>
with regard to policy , this minus number be multiply by the number of result which be not achieve each time one measure cancel out the intend effect of another . </s>
in today 's globalised world , this fact be all the more obvious . </s>
There be no boundary for Community policy . </s>
I be therefore glad that the Commission and the Council be once again take an interest in the coherence of Community policy , and that , together with complementarity between national and community policy and coordination between the service of the Commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union . </s>
both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state , in their respective working programme , that they wish to give coherence to those policy which have a very important impact on the develop country , but they do not specify concrete measure aim at introduce this coherence . </s>
both institution identify the most important area where this idea should be apply . </s>
for example , the Commission , in its long term guideline , say that the objective of sustainable development must be base on a strong sense of solidarity , support by a commercial policy which take common interest into account . </s>
the Commission be address a very important area , that be , commercial policy . </s>
however , this Parliament wish to add policy to aid development , agriculture , fishery policy , immigration , our position in international financial institution , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform . </s>
the Council - and Mr Luis Amado have say this this morning - have speak on different occasion of the need for coherence - the last time , it be true , being in November @card@ , and also on other occasion , such as the Development Councils of May @card@ and June @card@ - but with no concrete result . </s>
since the Development Council be in agreement with what he say - and this be very significant - there be little we can say , as some previous speaker have point out . </s>
however , as Parliament , we wish to propose - as other have say and as the resolution state - the creation of an inter-service work group consist of the people responsible for all the policy mention and the establishment of a monitor centre for the coherence of the different Community policy , which be capable of anticipate the effect of each policy on the develop country and amongst themselves . </s>
What we really want , however , be to be realist and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objective of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we be discuss at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union . </s>
let us hope - and we do hope - to be guide by the wind of change create by the Intergovernmental Conference , the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development service - , this new legislature and the prospect for enlargement , to perfect a more coherent political union . </s>
we therefore hope that the Commission , in the report it be go to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resource and the specific management of public interest . </s>
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their report and , in common with other , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy have not be give more prominence . </s>
but we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason be . </s>
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figure . </s>
at the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world 's rich country be three time high than in the poor country . </s>
in @card@ it be ten time high and in the year @card@ it be @card@ time higher . </s>
and there be no sign of this trend be be reverse . </s>
on the contrary , it look as if we have enter an exponential curve which be widen the gap still further . </s>
this be show by the follow figure : the income gap between the rich and poor fifth be @card@ : 1 in @card@ , @card@ : 1 in @card@ and @card@ : 1 in @card@ . </s>
these figure be from before the Internet revolution take off . </s>
in other word , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich country , include the Eu country , be not to surround themselves with barrier to prevent immigration on a massive scale . </s>
in a global village , major discrepancy in the world will not , in the long term , be tolerate by the poor section of the village . </s>
at some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justify . </s>
I would therefore urge the Council 's Presidency to set the promise debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , include the people of Europe , realise what globalisation mean and understand that a central element will have to be radical change in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide . </s>
the Eu on average be far from provide the pledge @card@ % . </s>
it may well be that other be bad , but that do not place us in any well a light . </s>
above all , however , we should give the country concern the opportunity to trade with us . </s>
as far as I could hear - but I may have miss something - the President-in-Office of the Council do not mention the word &quot; trade &quot; at all . </s>
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopt by the Commission and the Member States . </s>
I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete example of sectoral interest which be hold matter up , not only in the Commission but also in the Member States . </s>
I should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposal from , respectively , the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development . </s>
in that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receive proposal from all the government and from all over the Commission , which be scarcely likely to produce result . </s>
I shall conclude with a few word about the Internet revolution . </s>
as Commissioner Liikanen keep say on his travel , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunication . </s>
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own population but also for that of the develop country . </s>
this technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I refer and , in this connection , the Eu can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibility . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Nielson , if we do not have coherence in the various Eu policy area , then there be no chance , as it be , of development policy actually prove successful . </s>
for we can build something up on the one hand , only to tear down the product of our labour soon thereafter on the other ! </s>
unfortunately , it have to be say that , for the most part , Eu policy be far from coherent . </s>
this be particularly true of agricultural policy . </s>
for the European Union continue , on account of its aggressive export policy and market intervention tactic , to impede both the independent agricultural development of develop country and their endeavour to see their product adequately represent in our market . </s>
this kind of agricultural policy do not just harm the small and medium-sized producer in these country but have the self-same effect on producer in the European Union . </s>
they be be play off against each other . </s>
it be time that someone make this perfectly plain here . </s>
when I see , Mr President-in-Office of the Council Amado , that a country such as Brazil , which have a surface area of over 8 million square kilometre , now have to import basic foodstuff , and that almost @card@ million people be still undernourish and starve , then I be bind to say that this also have something to do with the way we pursue our agricultural policy , inasmuch as we produce our beef mountain with the soya from this country , only to store them in cold-storage again ! </s>
it be therefore quite clear that the policy must change , and of course that the develop country must also implement change that will benefit regional structure . </s>
What will also be of decisive importance in the future be the kind of policy the European Union intend to pursue , which will be of benefit to the country of the south in the World Trade Organisation in particular , how it intend to set about give these country a voice , an appropriate amount of say , and of course , how the European Union intend to open up its market to these country . </s>
for it will not do for us to ask the develop country , of all country , to open their market up to us , while we carry on building fortress Europe over here . </s>
the trip regulation also fail miserably to accommodate the resource in these country , for under its term they would have to pay dearly again for their basic product , which will have be patent by us beforehand . </s>
allow me to make another point on coherence within Parliament . </s>
vote be often take in the most diverse committee , as well as here in plenary sit , which in itself be not coherent and do not accord with the tenet of development policy . </s>
therefore , as a sector , development policy ought to cut across all committee , and it should not just be discuss once a year , like today , when it happen to be convenient . </s>
the policy of the @card@ Eu country must also be coordinate accordingly , for it will not do for us to carry on make development policy foot the bill for national interest and attach condition to development aid such as , &quot; if you buy our arm , you will get more development aid ! </s>
&quot; this situation can be allow to continue in the future . </s>
There be an urgent need for more coherence , and this do not just apply to the European Commission , and to the Union , but to us here in this Chamber too ! </s>
Mr President , the report call to account , however they also testify to the grow inconsistency between the development policy of the Union and that of its Member States . </s>
people may say that the elimination of poverty be the common denominator but that be more of a pipedream than reality . </s>
the fact be that over the past @card@ year the number of poverty-stricken people have not fall , rather it have increase to @card@ billion . </s>
an honest appraisal of North-South policy can get away from the fact that the gulf between the rich and poor country have grow wide . </s>
instead of describe this as a direct consequence of neoliberal politics , emphasis be place on the need to define the concept of &quot; good governance &quot; more clearly , where development aid be concern . </s>
nevertheless , I ask myself what moral right or claim we have to do so , when the necessary criterion , those of democracy and rule of law , be take a few knock themselves in the Eu Member States ? </s>
corruption be flourishing , party coffer be be plunder , and Eu fund be presumably be divert into election campaign coffer . </s>
we need to take a long , hard look at ourselves before we be in a position to establish realistic criterion . </s>
nor should we forget that the Eu Member States be not get closer to make @card@ % of GNP available for development aid , on the contrary , they be get ever further away from this goal . </s>
it also seem to me to be regrettable that the report do not say a word about the arm trade - other have already mention this . </s>
in ply this trade , not only do the industrialise country , in conjunction with the ruling caste in many ACP country , stand to make huge profit , but a vicious circle be also set in train that we ought not to forget . </s>
firstly , weapon be deliver , then violent conflict break out until , ultimately , troop from the state supply the arm be deploy , and then everything start all over again . </s>
I would particularly like to support the observation Mr Corrie make in his report to the effect that we have good reason to see that Cuba be give a fair hearing regard its application to join the ACP state . </s>
the report underline the change that be begin to take place there . </s>
we should not take our cue from the USA on this issue , rather we should rely on our own instinct more , and not create new and high hurdle . </s>
commissioner , it be a good thing to demand and achieve coherence of policy . </s>
however , we will also create coherence if the Commission do its policy work in conjunction with Parliament , and this , to my mind , be where there be major task in store for us , which I intend to involve myself with . </s>
Mr President , &quot; the Eu 's development cooperation leave a great deal to be desire &quot; . </s>
this be just a quote from a newspaper article which appear last week , comment on the Union 's development policy . </s>
this be not new . </s>
ever since we have attempt to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have be call into question . </s>
hope of improvement threaten to be nip in the bud if the Commission keep refuse to look into the mirror . </s>
why be the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminate externally ? </s>
One of the major conclusion of this report concern the European policy 's internal conflict . </s>
in term of trade and agriculture , in particular , the European policy be in conflict with the development policy . </s>
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed country . </s>
this have everything to do with the difference of opinion which exist among various country within the Union regard development cooperation . </s>
we should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relation , but as a policy in its own right . </s>
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy . </s>
as long as the European approach to the development issue create more inefficiency and waste more money , it remain appropriate to apportion a large role to the Member States . </s>
finally , I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I refer to to the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solution in a constructive way . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that this be an appropriate initiative and that it make very good sense . </s>
as various member have already comment , we often encounter situation where there be an enormous contradiction between our intention in term of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policy , whose objective run counter to development in those country . </s>
and we be not just talk about the concrete impact of our common policy , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fishery and industry . </s>
we be talk in general term - and this be more serious - about contradiction between our economic and trade policy and our defence policy . </s>
so there be a whole raft of contradiction . </s>
in my opinion , these contradiction be not all that serious in term of Community policy . </s>
they be , if anything , more serious as regard certain objective and industry in some Member States . </s>
we have to be aware of this . </s>
we often adopt resolution on peace process in other part of the world , as be recently the case with Indonesia , when we protest at the top of our voice only to discover subsequently that some European country have be supply them with arm and military equipment . </s>
for me , these be the most serious contradiction in all this , more serious than the contradiction inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policy . </s>
we obviously know that , even within any one country , there be always contradiction between various policy . </s>
that be a fact of life . </s>
and we must also be aware that there will be contradiction between the various Community policy , in this case development policy . </s>
we have to be aware that these contradiction exist and that we need to minimise them . </s>
the underlie reason for present this resolution be that the objective of minimise these contradiction be a fair and wise one . </s>
I believe that it be both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitor this coherence between Community policy and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre 's sphere of activity should not be limit just to Community policy , but should also cover Member States ' action and policy , include the action of economic group , which I think be also important . </s>
this monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on development in these policy and on their impact and interaction . </s>
I have leave to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think need to be note and approve by this House . </s>
our objective of minimise contradiction between development and cooperation policy and other policy have to be a valid objective , not merely within the European Union , but also at world level , give the increase globalisation of the economy . </s>
if we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiation , because it would be contradictory if the European Union impose a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the United States and the other major power to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint . </s>
that be why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principle to be establish at the next WTO round . </s>
Mr President , the Director-General of the DG for Development have say that to produce a report on coherence of Eu policy with development policy , before this spring 's paper on development policy itself , be like put the cart before the horse . </s>
never mind that the Commission 's requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the Council resolution , have produce only one &quot; non-paper &quot; , the real problem here be that at the time of rise world poverty this particular horse be climb uphill and the cart of other Eu policy be so heavy that development policy be actually be pull slowly backwards . </s>
time after time development policy be forget or be an afterthought when the major policy of this European Union be consider . </s>
take the new chocolate directive , which show that Eu country spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid . </s>
There have be no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer country , @card@ % of which be our ACP partner , estimate could cut income to cacao farmer by at least @card@ % . </s>
take the fishing agreement , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practice within the Eu water . </s>
we be , at the same time , negotiate joint venture allow increase access for Europe 's large-scale fishing vessel in develop country water at the expense of @card@ million small-scale fish worker in those country world-wide . </s>
take the trade agreement . </s>
as Mr Nielson say this morning with regard to Lomé , preferential access be only for &quot; essentially all the product of the least-developed country &quot; . </s>
in other word , when Eu commercial interest be concern , poverty consideration go out of the window . </s>
in the stance that we take at Seattle , why such a silence on the Eu 's failure to implement the trade concession for develop country already agree in the GATT , include for the crucial textile sector ? </s>
on the common agricultural policy , the big culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda @card@ Cap reform . </s>
Everyone now know of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dump @card@ @card@ tonne of excess subsidise beef on West African market , slash price for local cattle farmer by half . </s>
today beef stock stand at @card@ @card@ tonne . </s>
who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ? </s>
I welcome Mr Amadeus ' statement this morning , which acknowledge the difficulty of non-budgetisation of the EDF , which call for a more active role for the Development Council and which call for development priority to be central to the Eu 's emerge common foreign and security policy . </s>
I welcome too the Council declaration of @card@ , its resolution of @card@ and successive change in the Treaty of European Union . </s>
Action simply have not be take . </s>
that be why we want annual report , we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaint procedure , to make sure action be actually take . </s>
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing-up , to directly address those point in the resolution . </s>
Mr President , I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture . </s>
over the past couple of year , a considerable share of the fund have be channel towards the development of agriculture and cattle breed in the develop country and , more especially , the Lomé country . </s>
the result be certainly not what we expect . </s>
What could be the cause of this ? </s>
I think that the cause should first and foremost be seek in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various develop country , bar a few exception . </s>
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop . </s>
no farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if price be too low . </s>
the government in the develop country be always face with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmer or the people in the large city who want cheap food ? </s>
this fine balance must be strike in conjunction with the Commission , and not by the Commission on its own . </s>
in most country where the Commission be active , development aid be also grant by the Member States themselves . </s>
it should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravene that of the Commission . </s>
it be up to the Commission 's delegation in the develop country to assume a lead role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all country follow this line of approach . </s>
special attention be also require for the cost of the means of production . </s>
far too often , artificial fertiliser , veterinary medication and a host of other item be provide to farmer free of charge . </s>
once the project come to an end after five year , the policy of free gift also end . </s>
I think , therefore , that the cost element should be build in right from the outset in the policy of all project , and as far as I know , this be not the case by any stretch of the imagination . </s>
finally , I wonder whether the fund could not be put to good use . </s>
every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they be far behind in spend the fund . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , we be in actual fact hold a debate amongst the convert , which be a pity . </s>
we should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi , for example , who have miss a great chance right from the outset , for he have allow the development cooperation policy to fragment over three commissioner - and this be good than four , I have to admit - but this do not really make for a coherent policy . </s>
we also note that , as before , there be still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedure and argument . </s>
the President-in-Office of the Council come up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the European Development Fund . </s>
Parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arm . </s>
if this be possible , it would be a huge , historic victory . </s>
since Amsterdam , three term have take centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion . </s>
I believe that very little have be achieve in these three field . </s>
if a request be make for a report on the progress make on cohesion , if a request be make at all , then draft such a report can be very difficult , unless one simply admit that there be no cohesion at all . </s>
I would prefer it if a report be to be write on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy be to be develop to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it be a long way off yet . </s>
One thing shock me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council . </s>
he state : &quot; contradiction in policy can lead to balance . </s>
&quot; it be indeed the case that what one hand give can be take away by the other hand , and vice versa . </s>
but this lead to status-quo and self-deceit , and globalisation as a whole have so far only lead to change , indeed , but change which have only make poverty worse . </s>
this be suppose to be our priority , would you believe . </s>
I know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect . </s>
Mr President , we have already note that there be no report from the Commission , but I intend to discuss three matter in the light of the objective which the Council present in its @card@ opinion . </s>
the first be concern with conflict resolution . </s>
for many year , I have try , through the Council and the Commission , to find out why none of the institution be actively participate in , and work for , conflict resolution in the Western Sahara , which be occupy by Morocco . </s>
the UN have a peace plan . </s>
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end . </s>
I also want to take up the subject of migration . </s>
I be anxious about the new stipulation in the partnership agreement with the ACP country , which might make it easy to expel immigrant , asylum seeker and refugee on flimsy ground . </s>
I really also want to see the Eu pioneer patent on live organism . </s>
we now know that at least one person in the world die of hunger every four second . </s>
Three quarter of those who die be child under five year of age . </s>
this be not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talk a lot about today , namely increase poverty . </s>
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interest . </s>
I believe that patent on live organism be design only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purpose and for no other reason . </s>
I also want to see something about woman in the report I hope the Commission will produce . </s>
woman appear to be completely absent from all area , especially development policy when , of course , we be not in reality absent at all . </s>
Mr President , the debate we be hold today strongly underline the need to discuss development policy in much broad term than be involve in simply measure the flow of aid . </s>
the level of aid be naturally important , and the level of aid contribute by the rich country as a whole ought to be increase . </s>
this ought to be do with , in particular , a view to combat poverty and through invest in the development of capacity . </s>
however , the level of aid be only one of many instrument which significantly influence the development of poor country . </s>
a number of colleague have today point to area in addition to aid which be important and where contrast and conflict between different policy area be very serious indeed . </s>
the latter include trade , agricultural and fishery policy . </s>
other important area be , of course , the flow of private investment , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deal with , and finance solution to , a variety of global problem which affect us all . </s>
these problem include question of climate , health issue , biodiversity etc , and the problem be clearly exacerbate by globalisation , that be to say the new economy which be develop . </s>
in this economy , the connection between different policy area be that much more marked . </s>
in my opinion , what we be discuss here today be partly the Eu 's contribution to the debate about the opportunity and risk of globalisation and about the rule there must be in order to give poor country a decent chance . </s>
the report , or survey , which Mrs Maij-Weggen have demand , show how the various policy area fit together and what the aforementioned conflict appear to be , be naturally quite crucial . </s>
I can help but wonder why the Commission have not do more . </s>
the Commission be new and have to be give time , but the absence of such a survey suggest that there be powerful tension within the Commission . </s>
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussion within the Commission . </s>
in addition to a report of this kind , I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character . </s>
an analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different type of aid and transfer of resource which influence poor country . </s>
these include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc . </s>
it should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we be conduct . </s>
finally , Parliament recommend , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a work party should be establish in order to bring about coherence . </s>
I believe it be only a coincidence , but the Commissioner for the Environment be also , of course , to participate in this group . </s>
let us hope that the debate in which we be now engage will prove to have be a watershed . </s>
policy so far have be characterise far too much by a process of give with the one hand and take away with the other . </s>
There be a lot of people who will be watch further development with great interest . </s>
Mr President , the Seattle demonstrator argue that free trade be bad for the less- and least-developed country , it be purely a rich country selfish interest . </s>
yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminate poverty in country such as India and Tanzania over the @card@ or @card@ year since they become independent . </s>
there the theory go that protectionism and state intervention would preserve job , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain . </s>
it do not work ; poverty become bad than ever . </s>
the medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but open one 's economy to competition at home and abroad force optimal application of resource and lead to a high standard and quality of life in the not so long term . </s>
be that not the lesson of the European union itself and of the single market in particular ? </s>
as Mr Nielson say , this be a fine example to those country and region aspire to great prosperity . </s>
yet preach the benefit of free trade to the develop country be not enough . </s>
we also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for import from these country . </s>
Parliament 's resolution on the WTO negotiation advocate a free import policy by the Eu . </s>
eliminate all remain barrier to import , tariff barrier and quota and , just as important , non-tariff barrier , such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mention in her speech - eliminate these barrier would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for develop country the economic progress which both we and they desire . </s>
it be quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminish our development effort and must also diminish the political regard of the develop country for Europe and our fine word . </s>
Mr President , in the last couple of day we have hear fine word about the need for great coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programme of the Community and of the Member States . </s>
There be one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union 's ability to match word with action . </s>
I be refer to the continue tragedy of anti-personnel landmine which present an obstacle to so many development programme , to post-conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the life of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poor part of the world , particularly in develop country . </s>
over recent year the Community have spend some EUR @card@ million in mine clearance , assistance to victim and related activity . </s>
the Member States have spend similar amount . </s>
but there be still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agree with other member of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span . </s>
Mr Nielson identify the problem of lack of concerted action and the need for good complementarity with Member States . </s>
this have be talk about for year . </s>
the Commission need to carry out internal organisational change , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its action , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell . </s>
it would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedure and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improve management of its programme . </s>
a proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programme need to take place in each of the country seriously afflict by landmine . </s>
it seem to me that the landmine issue encapsulate so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulty which have afflict the Commission and the Union . </s>
be these affliction of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union be still unable to meet its aspiration ? </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention be an important step towards great coherence . </s>
and it be to be welcome that criterion such as human right , democracy , rule of law , and good governance be more firmly anchor in this new treaty than they be previously , and that earlier colonial relation no longer shape most of our relation to quite the same extent , rather , we now set great store by these political criterion in this respect . </s>
for these be prerequisite to any development . </s>
if these criterion be not adhere to , then development do not stand a chance the same go for Cuba , Mr Modrow . </s>
I welcome the fact that Cuba be get closer to join this process . </s>
but for this to happen , there be also go to have to be a few change in Cuba . </s>
after all , we be all familiar with the report from Amnesty International . </s>
it may well be that you , have belong to one of the last communist dictatorship , view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber , and that you have problem where good governance be concern . </s>
Nonetheless , these be important criterion for the European Union . </s>
There be a second issue I would like to raise . </s>
we be discuss coherence here . </s>
Many speaker have cite example of the extent to which the various policy be not coherent . </s>
in my view , however , the development policy itself need to be more coherent too . </s>
There be no coherence because there be still no effective coordination with the Member States and there be some project be carry out by the Member States and the European union in the develop country which be very much at odd with one another . </s>
nor be there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which be accommodate in the Union 's budget but the EDF remain outside it . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , if in future you succeed in make this EUR @card@ billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control , and to body such as Olaf , then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability . </s>
this , to my mind , be also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do , i. e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union . </s>
Mr President , we certainly must concede that , on balance , this text be full of good intention , but we do not vote in favour of it in committee , nor shall we do so in plenary . </s>
we have two reason for this , both of which give rise to amendment which I should like to explain here very briefly . </s>
first , the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocate the communitisation of the EDF ; clearly that be misguided . </s>
in our view , cooperation be , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise . </s>
with Europe prepare to enlarge , communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be waste a fruitful and promising opportunity of associate our southern partner with our cooperation policy . </s>
lastly , the Commission have , in the recent past , have trouble manage the fund for development and humanitarian aid transparently , as Mrs Maes have just remind us so opportunely . </s>
why should we add to them ? </s>
secondly , we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie 's report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because , in the final analysis , this report be typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission be take ever more frequent recourse . </s>
it be perfectly astound that the Union could have negotiate an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section be quite simply leave blank . </s>
and let me say in pass , it be even more astonishing that the Council allow it to . </s>
as a result , we be now in the absurd position of negotiate from a position of weakness on vital aspect such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already sign . </s>
the part of this agreement which block negotiation could mean that the Union end up pay producer to stop produce sherry , port and a whole host of product which be purely and simply copy under international commercial law . </s>
imagine the potential cost of such a precedent . </s>
it be proof , as if we still need it , of the fact that immature diplomacy , which defend no interest , unless of course they be individual interest , and be catch between the dogma of free trade and pressure group and more or less friendly NGOs , be not just inefficient , it be positively dangerous . </s>
finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report . </s>
nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly be see as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatiser in Geneva and Washington . </s>
it be a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern country should be develop and strengthen . </s>
the Corrie report miss this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for lose so much . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspect of this debate . </s>
first of all , many speaker stress that globalisation accentuate regional imbalance and social inequality , and increase poverty . </s>
this suggest that something must be do , fail which tension will be aggravate and conflict jeopardise international peace and stability will arise or worsen . </s>
secondly , it will be important to approach development policy from a different angle in this context , take advantage of their capacity for correct imbalance and reduce inequality . </s>
I believe that the importance that everyone have attach to the European Union 's role in international development policy be significant . </s>
Everyone recognise , indeed this be the theme of today 's debate , that , if the European Union be to play a more active and lead role in development policy at world level , it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policy . </s>
I note that some speaker also emphasise that responsibility for coherence in Eu policy be not a matter for the Council , for the Commission or for Parliament alone . </s>
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in term of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation , be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council , or even on the part of the European Parliament itself , and some member have in fact already suggest that a monitoring centre or a work party could be establish to monitor the impact of various policy in the specific area of development . </s>
finally , I would like to emphasise that it be also important - and this be one of the priority of the Portuguese Presidency 's programme - to note the view that it be necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union 's policy , and in particular in the context of its foreign policy . </s>
we believe that this be absolutely vital , fail which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regard the coherence of policy , and we can do this without give development policy their rightful place as an instrument for uphold the principle and value underpin Europe 's status in the international system . </s>
for this reason it may be necessary , as I have stress , to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policy . </s>
in this respect I believe - and some speaker here have also comment on this - that the adoption of the new convention , which succeed the Lomé Convention , be an important instrument of renewal , and represent a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of country from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process , as demonstrate by the first negotiate round in Seattle . </s>
. </s>
I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contribution to this debate . </s>
I have give you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provide a useful background to this discussion . </s>
we will furnish more detailed material relate directly to all the issue concern coherence . </s>
this discussion be not new . </s>
we be currently work on it in the Commission and when that work be do I will report on it , as many have be ask if it will be possible to see the report on coherence . </s>
I have no doubt that as a result of the increase political attention attach to these problem - something which have clearly be reflect in the debate today - it will be easy for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda . </s>
this also call for the introduction of further new mechanism in the Commission system which may very well include , as suggest by some of the political group in Parliament , the set up of a special intra-service work group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission . </s>
I have read - and hear in the debate - that coherence be be use as some kind of a miracle formula that take care of everything . </s>
I think it be important to keep it as a relatively clearly define discipline of try to reduce inconsistency where they really exist , and we certainly do have them . </s>
much of this have to do with real disagreement between sector interest in each and every Member State , as have be very honestly say here in this House : people more or less identify with their sphere of interest , and all this be legitimate . </s>
I would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence be the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system . </s>
this exist , but it be only a small part of what we be discuss . </s>
the major part of it have to do with well know established difference of interest between sex and so on , and this be the problem . </s>
Mr Mulder mention that no farmer will start produce anything if the price be too low . </s>
this be true in our part of the world , but our partner and beneficiary in Africa have a slightly different perspective . </s>
they farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this make a difference . </s>
subsistence farming be not base on price calculation , it be base on the hope of rain in the next season . </s>
this do not apply to all farming in develop country but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver well than so far . </s>
from that perspective , what I be say here be of deep relevance . </s>
other issue have be mention : cattle-farming in Namibia , tomato and milk powder in the Caribbean . </s>
we should not be too masochistic . </s>
There be a limit to how useful that be . </s>
All these case be characterise by the fact that they have be take care of . </s>
the intervention price have be regulate , and the problem we have with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia be actually solve by reduce the intervention support . </s>
these be real problem , but they have all be deal with . </s>
as regard the issue of cacao , chocolate : I repeat that the 5 % have to do with create a basis for a living in the neighbour country . </s>
What we be talk about here be the local nut which be as important to the people collect them and make a live out of them in Burkina Faso as coconut for farmer in Ghana . </s>
this be not a clear case of incoherence , it be more a case of a competition between supplier . </s>
What be mention concern sugar in the Caribbean be more complicated . </s>
in the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspect represent a complicated problem , but it may be that what we be talk about here have more to do with promote the interest of some European company than with generate income in the Caribbean . </s>
in any case , this be a matter which we be currently deal with . </s>
I be commit to try to create a balance in all these issue and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa . </s>
in all modesty , I would claim that this be something that document that the Commission be willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interest . </s>
we certainly have do our share to solve that problem , and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming year of that agreement . </s>
finally , I thank you again for this debate . </s>
we will come back again with material on these issue , because these problem , in one way or another , be here to stay , simply because development cooperation represent basically do something in the world that be different from take care of traditionally-defined trade interest , etc . </s>
we have to reconcile those different approach . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson . </s>
I have receive eight motion for resolution table in accordance with Rule @card@ ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place on Thursday at @card@ p. m. next session of UN Human Rights Commission the next item be the statement by the Council on Eu priority for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on @card@ March @card@ . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , as you know , the European Union play an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission hold in Geneva in March and April @card@ . </s>
it table resolution on the human right situation in Iran , Iraq , in the Israeli settlement , in Burma / Myanmar , in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan , and negotiate statement to be issue on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor . </s>
for the first time , the European Union table a resolution on the death penalty , which be enormously successful , and lead work on a resolution concern child 's right , which be a joint initiative with the Latin American group of country . </s>
the Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be hold in Geneva in March and April . </s>
in particular , as agree at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February @card@ , the European Union intend to table draft resolution on the Israeli settlement , Iran , Iraq , Sudan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Burma / Myanmar , a draft chairman 's statement on Colombia , and , possibly , on East Timor , together with a draft statement on the situation in various country . </s>
the European Union will continue discussion on preparation for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March . </s>
in particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of table a draft resolution on the death penalty . </s>
To date , the group have not reach agreement on the strategy to be adopt in this respect , and in particular with regard to formulate a compromise to be table in the last resort in case of any amendment to the contrary , include Article 2 ( 7 ) of the Charter of the United Nations , which refer to sovereignty . </s>
we have try to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text , in view of the difficulty that arise at the @card@ session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly , at which the Member States fail to agree on an amendment introduce a reference to Article 2 ( 7 ) into the draft resolution sponsor by the European union on the death penalty . </s>
as you know , at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission hold last year , the United States decide , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on China . </s>
this draft resolution be defeat by a Chinese no-action motion . </s>
the European Union vote against that motion . </s>
the European Union 's position on the approach to be adopt towards China in the Human Rights Commission be confirm at the General Affairs Council on @card@ March @card@ : there be no European Union initiative on China nor be agreement reach to co-sponsor a resolution on China , but an Eu vote against the no-action motion . </s>
it be by no mean certain that the European Union could have maintain a unite front if this resolution have be put to the vote . </s>
the United States of America will be table a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and be put pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution . </s>
this initiative have provoke a strong reaction on China 's part : the Chinese authority be make representation to the country and institution of the European Union , in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States ' initiative . </s>
this initiative be be discuss within the Union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future . </s>
it be in the interest of the European Union to keep all its option open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the EU-China human right dialogue meeting be hold on @card@ February @card@ . </s>
in view of change make to the membership of the Human Rights Commission , we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close . </s>
it be therefore important this year , too , that the country of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution . </s>
in this context it be important to note that the European Union regularly oppose request by China that the human right dialogue should automatically rule out table a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva . </s>
the European Union unequivocally consider that although it be a very valuable instrument for exchange view and for take note of the overall position of the other party , the dialogue should also yield concrete result on the ground , and when this do not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission , potentially whilst the dialogue be continue . </s>
the European Union also regularly inform China that the Human Rights Commission be the appropriate body for consider human right issue , and whether or not it agree with this initiative , this be in any case legitimate from this point of view . </s>
the next human right dialogue will take place on @card@ February in Lisbon , and will include seminar on legal issue and on woman 's right , and it be expect that representative from the academic world and from civil society will take part . </s>
the next human right seminar will be organise by the Portuguese Presidency in May @card@ , and , during the last round of the dialogue in October @card@ , the Chinese side accept the European Union 's proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratify the United Nations International Pact on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations ' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights , both of which have be sign by the Chinese government . </s>
the European Union be discuss issue on which it hope that China will take concrete measure , and on the basis of these discussion the presidency will convey to the Chinese authority the message that the European Union hope China will announce positive measure at the session on @card@ February . </s>
the presidency will also present to the Chinese authority a list of individual case on which it intend to express its serious concern . </s>
the meeting hold in Beijing in October @card@ confirm that , on the one hand , the Chinese authority be willing to make concession on issue relate to the dialogue itself , with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal form of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention . </s>
on the other hand , they will not give any ground on the pivotal question of the single party system and territorial integrity . </s>
discussion within the European union about the situation in China follow the outcome of the dialogue round in @card@ have lead the European Union to decide to express its concern about human right violation in China more firmly ; the same apply to the absence of concrete outcome from the dialogue , while recognise the positive step that China have make on the international stage . </s>
on various occasion the European Union have reiterate to the Chinese authority its disappointment with the result of the dialogue , and have stress that it hope for good outcome in certain more sensitive area . </s>
it be decide that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , give that China have agree with the European Union 's proposal to restructure the dialogue by mean of good use of expert and to establish a close link with the seminar . </s>
lastly , during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalise the work of the Commission itself . </s>
a work party have be set up with the express task of revise the Commission 's mechanism . </s>
this work party have work hard to reach agreement that it be essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanism and to make them more rigorous , especially in the financial field . </s>
the European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission 's activity to limit its capacity for intervention by restrict its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human right issue at world level . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank the presidency for the work it have do to prepare for Geneva on subject like racism , civil and political right and the right to development . </s>
as the presidency say , much remain to be do , despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session . </s>
that be easy say than do - we be still discuss some of the tough issue . </s>
for example , discussion be take place about many of the matter raise in Parliament 's resolution and it be too early to predict the outcome in all case . </s>
it be not surprising that the debate be long and difficult . </s>
that do not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human right but it do indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference . </s>
however , let me reflect that concern by refer to three controversial issue : the death penalty , Cuba and China . </s>
I be go to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflection to creep into my remark . </s>
we be currently review the option and possibility for introduce a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission . </s>
this have always be a subject about which I personally have feel extremely strongly , I have always vote against the death penalty . </s>
spur on by Amnesty International and other , one of the first decision I take as Governor of Hong Kong be to abolish the death penalty . </s>
we know what happen recently at the UN General Assembly . </s>
we have to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporate wholly unacceptable argument that assert that human right be not universally applicable and valid . </s>
the New York stage be different from Geneva . </s>
last year 's debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention be such a sensitive topic that it influence all other issue . </s>
it certainly influence the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty . </s>
the debate in Geneva , however , be more focus on human right issue . </s>
we may therefore stand a good chance of make progress there . </s>
secondly , Cuba . </s>
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe be criticise unfairly for not take human right there sufficiently seriously . </s>
we be extremely concern about move by the Cuban government over the last year that have further curtail public freedom , move like change in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty . </s>
we be also worry by the recent increase in the number of political detention . </s>
we be monitor the human right situation through the report of NGOs and the work of our human right work group base in the Eu embassy in Havana . </s>
we have regularly put our criticism to the Cuban authority , and this Parliament have do the same . </s>
but I do not believe that the right approach be to try to isolate Cuba . </s>
we want a fair and open society in Cuba , a Cuba which respect the principle of the market , the sanctity of contract and the rule of law . </s>
we want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human right and fundamental freedom . </s>
my view be exactly the same when it come to the third subject with which I wish to deal , namely China . </s>
quite simply , I want us to be engage with China . </s>
it would be self-indulgent and self-defeat , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else . </s>
I also want to see a China transform by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which do not lock up democracy activist or religious believer . </s>
so what should we do ? </s>
naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible term . </s>
it be a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which do not include China - or Russia , for that matter . </s>
but I do not believe today , nor have I ever believe , that our burgeon economic relationship with China - manifest , for example , by China 's EUR @card@ billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it come to China 's human right record . </s>
for me the question be not whether we should address the question of human right in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in do so - but rather what be the most effective way of do this ? </s>
so what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ? </s>
as the presidency have note , the Union as a whole be consider its position . </s>
but I strongly suggest there be a number of factor of which the Member States ought to take proper account . </s>
first , while some people question whether table a Geneva resolution make any difference , several of the most distinguished Chinese advocate of democracy strongly believe that it be a valuable move , not least because of the message it send to people in China itself . </s>
that be a point that deserve serious consideration . </s>
secondly , we will all want to take proper account of what have actually be happen in China in recent month , for instance , the heavy sentence impose on democracy campaigner , the detention and recent punishment mete out to member of Christian church and the arrest and sentence of the member of Falun Gong . </s>
Chinese leader be in no doubt about our position on all these issue and on development in Tibet . </s>
we have make our view very clear to them . </s>
while we all know that for many people in China there have be a real long-term improvement in their economic prospect and their social and economic liberty , there be a dark side to the picture as well . </s>
critic of table a resolution say that at least we now have a human right dialogue with China . </s>
that be true and potentially valuable , although I have to say - and I have say to Chinese official as have the presidency - that there have not be nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have like . </s>
of course the dialogue have enable us to identify and implement Eu cooperation programme in the human right and legal sphere . </s>
that be very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level . </s>
naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human right be go to be a long-term process , but I wish I could point to more real gain . </s>
the next dialogue in Lisbon on @card@ February will be an important test . </s>
it will show whether the dialogue be produce result or not . </s>
What , finally , do we want to see as the first step ? </s>
well , for example , we would like to see China move from sign the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratify them . </s>
I wish we be closer to that . </s>
where do all that leave us this year ? </s>
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their mind . </s>
What I hope be , first , that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be pick off , that our position will not be base on self-delusion or pretence , that it will be a common position and a sensible position . </s>
I know that some people say we must have a good way of press our concern about human right than through table resolution . </s>
but if that be true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in look for that way forward . </s>
if we be to rest our position on the human right dialogue , then we need to be able to convince you , the Ngo community and the public at large that it be actually get somewhere . </s>
that , in my judgement , be the challenge for the next few week . </s>
I be grateful to the house for its concern about human right around the world , and particularly in China . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Patten . </s>
we will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concern the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote . </s>

that conclude the vote explanation of VOTE- Lienemann report ( A5-0014 / @card@ ) . </s>
( FR ) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on Life . </s>
I shall briefly remind you that Life be a financial instrument use to support environmental policy within the European Union and also in third country , whether they be neighbour country around the Mediterranean , country around the Baltic Sea or applicant country . </s>
the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection have propose many amendment which have , for the most part , be retain in the common position adopt by the Council . </s>
as far as the third phase of Life ( @card@ ) be concern , the instrument be to be divide into three section , LIFE-Nature ( @card@ % of the resource ) , LIFE-Environment ( @card@ % ) and LIFE-Third Countries ( 6 % ) . </s>
in my opinion , the most important amendment concern the following : life 's contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment , particularly regard the integration of the environment into other policy , as well as to the implementation and update of legislation relate to the environment ; improve the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedure for the implementation of Life , procedure for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedure for cooperation between recipient ; the objective of Life : this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development , in close association with the pilot project carry out under the Urban initiative , on which I have have the opportunity to speak elsewhere ; the contribution that the project support by Life make to the sustainability of social and economic activity , and thus job creation . </s>
I consider it crucial that the Life instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate country from central and eastern Europe . </s>
the other candidate country ( E. G. Cyprus , Turkey , Malta ) my also take part in Life when agreement permit such participation be sign with these country . </s>
the stumbling block in the negotiation with the Council lie , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocate for the third phase of the Life programme ( @card@ ) . </s>
the Commission proposal , ratify by the Council , be for EUR @card@ million , whilst the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection consider that the budget should be EUR @card@ million . </s>
I support Mrs Lienemann 's firm stance . </s>
the financial allocation have not in fact be upgrade since the programme be create , even when the membership of the EC be increase to fifteen Member States follow enlargement . </s>
if the report be adopt in plenary session , then conciliation proceeding will have to be open , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriation earmark for the programme . </s>
this type of procedure be common practice since the programme or legislative measure be too often allocate budget which do not live up to their ambition ! </s>
Böge report ( A5-0023 / @card@ ) . </s>
( FR ) as an MEP and , more importantly , as a consumer , I welcome the European Commission 's proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union . </s>
this proposal have two objective : first , to amend the @card@ Council Directive on animal health condition by remove the provision on scrapie and , secondly , to introduce a new regulation establish rule for prevent and combat transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( Tse ) or BSE-type disease affect sheep and other animal specie . </s>
What be interesting abut this new legislation be that a specific legal basis be be create in order to combat scrapie . </s>
What be even more satisfactory be that this be one of our main demand in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis . </s>
I also consider it essential , for the sake of coherence , that existing legislation on scrapie , which be limit to the trade in ovine and caprine animal , should be incorporate in a single and complete set of new rule on Tse affect all animal throughout the European Union , rule design to prevent the consumption of foodstuff or feedingstuffs . </s>
these rule be all the more welcome in that doubt still persist as regard scrapie . </s>
a number of scientific hypothesis maintain that scrapie develop into BSE in cow and therefore cause the BSE epidemic . </s>
even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain Tse need to be make more accurate and more effective , especially as regard detect and fight scrapie , it be still a notable improvement . </s>
it be a pledge to European citizen , who have voice their concern , as regard European food policy , on many occasion . </s>
the European Parliament have relay their concern and they have be hear . </s>
as a result of the debate on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the European Commission have present a White Paper on food safety . </s>
this White Paper set out several area of concern and propose the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence . </s>
it be up to us , as responsible European , to prove that the single market and the free movement of good and food safety be not mutually exclusive . </s>
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0008 / @card@ ) Mr President , I vote for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it be one of the most important sector within the remit of the European Parliament . </s>
in my view , product of the mind be far more valuable than tangible product , namely , those that can be see and touch . </s>
the fruit of the intellect and science , which be intangible , be of inestimable importance . </s>
therefore , the European Community should be more energetic in provide practical encouragement , not just through uphold patent but through concession and other form of support for scientist who be strive , through the knowledge and experience they have acquire , to give future generation something good than that which they have today . </s>
. </s>
( da ) we oppose , on principle , the European Community be enter into treaty on copyright law on behalf of the Member States . </s>
we be nonetheless aware that we be concern here with a sharing of power between the Member States and the Community . </s>
at the same time , we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaty be a significant step forward in the direction of guarantee the right of distributor and practise artist . </s>
we be therefore vote in favour of the recommendation . </s>
- ( de ) the Group of the green / European Free Alliance abstain from the vote on this matter because , in the plenary debate of the previous day , Commissioner Bolkestein do not respond to any of my question regard Eu accession to the WIPO Treaties . </s>
in institutional term , there have be no clarification of what role the EP be to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties . </s>
in addition , there be a clear tendency , in matter of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure Eu jurisdiction . </s>
when it be , then , still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making process , the question of legitimacy arise . </s>
moreover , the concept of ' author ' be not define in the treaty . </s>
in this regard , too , the Commission have not answer the question as to what definition it wish to base its discussion on , and whether it wish to settle foreseeable conflict by impose its own definition of the law on other . </s>
One of the tricky aspect be the public interest : will ratify and apply WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture ? </s>
and , finally , the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarify . </s>
regard this , too , there have be only silence by way of a response from the Commission . </s>
if nothing helpful be forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate plan for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting . </s>
Graefe zu Baringdorf ( A5-0015 / @card@ ) . </s>
( PT ) Food safety issue be in the spotlight follow the BSE and dioxin scandal . </s>
GMOs be still the subject of great uncertainty , both in term of their environmental impact and of their effect on human and animal health . </s>
the precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty . </s>
the use of biotechnology need to be study in great depth and not just &quot; package &quot; for immediate sale to boost the profit of a few multinational in this sector . </s>
the profit motive be very much behind the present food safety crisis . </s>
this be the context that the rapporteur find himself work in , make a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs , and note that the latter &quot; shall be authorise only if ... safe for human health and the environment &quot; . </s>
furthermore , he consider that &quot; genetically modify additive shall be clearly identify as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which be affix to or accompany the additive &quot; . </s>
this will facilitate great control and traceability of such additive and guarantee the consumer 's freedom of choice . </s>
in view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) , I welcome the fact that the rapporteur have include these issue in his report , and I have therefore vote in favour of it . </s>
Stenzel report ( A5-0034 / @card@ ) Mr President , I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the PPE Group on the Equal report . </s>
we have follow a nominal list which be identical to that which we have agree upon beforehand with the Socialist Group . </s>
the Socialist Group have now change its mind and this be why the report be not as clear as it would have be . </s>
this be why we be abstain . </s>
we want to ensure that the equal report , which be very important for refugee , the elderly , the handicapped and woman , simply go ahead . </s>
it be regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report have receive such unfavourable attention in this plenary session . </s>
I be convince that the rapporteur 's nationality have play a certain role , which should not be of relevance in this Parliament . </s>
this be actually in conflict with European value and certainly with the parliamentary value which be refer to so often in this Parliament . </s>
these be our reason for abstain from the vote on this report . </s>
we want Equal to go ahead . </s>
we assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some group have exploit this procedure to their advantage . </s>
Mr President , as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party in the European Parliament , I abstain in the vote on the equal initiative because , although it provide more support than in the past for project aim at combat age discrimination , its proposal be not sufficiently trenchant or specific . </s>
I also abstain for another reason . </s>
I think the time have come for the European institution to stop experiment and try to establish good practice for do what we should do and begin to give European citizen some firm indication regard what Europe want Europe to be . </s>
the time have come for concrete measure and for put theory into practice . </s>
. </s>
( da ) we have vote in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concern the guideline for Eu initiative programme ( CIP ) . </s>
basically , we be oppose to programme and structural fund of this type but , since the vote be only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resource be to be use , we have simply adopt a position on the issue . </s>
we think it be important to guarantee equal opportunity for the group discuss in the report . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) we do not vote against this report insofar as it contain a number of correct general principle such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequality between the sex on the job market . </s>
nor do we vote for it because it be all too vague , all too pie in the sky . </s>
and yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugee , the report mark a step backwards from the initial text by stipulate that they no longer apply to refugee as such but to &quot; refugee within the meaning of the Geneva Convention &quot; . </s>
this restriction be inadmissible at a time when countless refugee throughout Europe be in a drastic situation , with no protection , force to work on the black market , and to hide , while so-called democratic government and state police force hunt them down . </s>
the first thing we need to do in this area be to give these stateless people the legal mean to live a decent life and be able to work without be relegate to the status of pariah , the victim of unscrupulous employer and multiple form of administrative and police harassment , the main form of which be have to live in permanent fear of expulsion . </s>
. </s>
I vote in favour of Mrs Stenzel 's report on the equal initiative as I believe that it be essential to continue the work begin under the previous NOW , HORIZON , YOUTHSTART and Integra strand of the ADAPT and employment initiative . </s>
the lesson we have learn under these action must be build on . </s>
equal stand for &quot; equality &quot; . </s>
it must be see to deliver . </s>
I welcome the propose concentration on promote new way of combat discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market . </s>
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partner together in search of innovative way to tackle unemployment . </s>
There must be flexibility . </s>
I deeply regret that only limited fund be available for this initiative . </s>
in the last programming period 9 % of structural fund be available for Community initiative . </s>
the figure be now @card@ % . </s>
this mean that fund must be use to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnership must be widely and rapidly disseminate . </s>
the Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopt several of the amendment I put forward , concern for example , the emphasis on access to start-up capital , how to exploit new business opportunity in city , town and rural area and the criticism that under the previous initiative there be inadequate participation by business . </s>
this often mean that good project do not lead to real job opportunity . </s>
the positive experience of innovative action of small promoter be jeopardise by their distance from the policy process . </s>
I also stress the need for prevention . </s>
the involvement of the social partner also need to be highlight . </s>
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduce as a priority . </s>
There must be flexibility also for country with small budget . </s>
while there be some aspect of the report which I believe would be well deal with in a different way , overall I believe the report offer a flexible and sensible approach and should be support . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) the Commission intend to use the Community initiative Equal to replace the Community employment and ADAPT initiative and various subprogrammes in these area , such as NOW , on new opportunity for woman , HORIZON , for disabled person , YOUTHSTART , for promote the labour market integration of young people , and Integra , for group threaten with exclusion . </s>
unfortunately , this involve a significant reduction in appropriation . </s>
accordingly , the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it consider to be new way of fight discrimination and inequality of all kind in the labour market , base on the four pillar of the employment policy guideline . </s>
this be a great deal to build on such fragile foundation . </s>
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the Commission should have opt for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involve the NGOs from the outset , so that partnership could develop in a balanced way . </s>
the Commission do not do that . </s>
we hope that it will at least revisit the aspect that we have mention . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) we welcome the fact that the European Parliament be continue its initiative to fight discrimination and inequality , and the four area include in the Equal programme - employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunity for man and woman - would appear to be genuinely relevant . </s>
however , this report , although probably inspire by the good intention , occasionally take a direction which I feel be highly dangerous in that it tend to erase notion of citizenship and legality and turn a multiplicity of exception into the common law on which the Community approach be base . </s>
even if one can but applaud the decision to adopt specific measure to eradicate all form of discrimination on the labour market , which might affect asylum seeker whom life have already , by definition , treat badly , we still need to keep a legal conception of this notion : to put it plainly , where there be every reason to help asylum seeker who follow the correct procedure and be duly recognise as such , the same do not apply to the numerous category list in the report , namely applicant , those under temporary protection and those deny refugee status and threaten with repatriation , for whom the report make provision for identical assistance . </s>
There be a risk that the so-called aid measure provide for in the report will spread insidiously and with disastrous result : asylum seeker , of course , plus asylum seeker under temporary protection while their application be be process and asylum seeker whose application have be reject and who be threaten with expulsion should all , accord to the report , be able to benefit from this set of measure , whereas their very status - after all , what be an asylum seeker who have be refuse refugee status and who be threaten with expulsion if not an illegal immigrant - should , at least for the last category , exclude them from a policy to integrate them into a community which do not acknowledge their presence in its midst as legal or legitimate . </s>
whether we like it or not , a signal of this sort would be a fearful invitation to immigrant who , merely by apply for refugee status , irrespective of whether or not it be grant , would be able to qualify for a range of aid measure design to help them integrate permanently into the labour market , in a general climate of shortage , in which the legal population , both foreign and indigenous , be cruelly aware of the problem of unemployment . </s>
consequently , despite its general approach , which can but be endorse , I be unable to support a report which contain in it the seed of a new attack on the concept of citizenship and republican legitimacy which I hold so dear . </s>
Lieneman report ( A5-0027 / @card@ ) Mr President , some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film , &quot; Cocoon &quot; , in which some elderly people drink a special kind of water that make them young again . </s>
in my view , it be , therefore , immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and , consequently , to study and approve the provision refer to here . </s>
for that reason , I approve these measure , but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enter our house , to ensure that it be of the high level . </s>
in the measure that have be adopt , I note that support for people who purify their water in their own home have be omit . </s>
I trust that this will be remedy in the future . </s>
. </s>
( el ) despite the relative improvement of the first draft of the directive on water policy , follow the incorporation of some of the European Parliament 's amendment in the Council 's common position , the directive remain problematic . </s>
particularly important issue be the following : the new index for water should be compulsory ; provision should be make for protect groundwater from pollution ; provision should be make for purify contaminated groundwater ; there should be a ban on the discharge of some @card@ hazardous substance into water ; substance which be not currently monitor ; a system for determine pollutant in water be urgently need ; the cost of water supply service should include the environmental cost of produce it ; whereas , in general , the provision of water should be price at cost , special exception should be make for area affect by permanent and extensive drought , in relation to their social and economic circumstance ( for example , impoverished region or social group ) ; a short timescale be need for implement the directive . </s>
apart from Amendment No @card@ , which be an error , since I intend to vote in favour , the rest of my vote can be explain by mean of the follow fictional situation : suppose draft environmental directive : &quot; European Parliament and Council Directive establish the obligation to maintain , during winter , a temperature of no less than eighteen degree centigrade in the street , square and park of the city of Europe &quot; . </s>
guideline of the Directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in term of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieve by @card@ ; b ) the full cost shall be pass on to the inhabitant of each city by mean of electricity price . </s>
opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe : &quot; this directive would be unfair since , for example , the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred time great than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples &quot; . </s>
opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe : &quot; nevertheless , this be a question of competitivity and equality of condition &quot; . </s>
( end of fiction ) . </s>
in explain my vote , I must say that it be positive that there be a Community directive on water , but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe , but will lead to legislative caricature . </s>
we can give equal treatment to country which suffer from flood and drought , such as the Mediterranean country , and country with northern level of rainfall . </s>
furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfer of water , between different river basin , practically impossible in the future . </s>
once more we must remember that we be undergo a continental project for political union . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) Drinking , eating , washing , farm - water irrigate each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource . </s>
a simple gesture such as turn on a tap seem to bring water straight from the source . </s>
but the source be threaten to run dry . </s>
scientific study be now no more than a formality : water will be the main resource at stake in year to come , start tomorrow . </s>
but tomorrow will be too late . </s>
we have to lay down the rule of play today , before we all lose . </s>
in adopt the water directive on Wednesday @card@ February , the European Parliament confirm its wish to protect surface water , coastal waster , inland water and groundwater . </s>
Europe now have a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water , promote its sustainable use , protect eco-system , help fight flood and drought and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substance . </s>
we have throw water a life-belt . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) it be with the great satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy . </s>
the ecological disaster on the bank of the Danube be a reminder , as if we need one , that all too often human negligence jeopardise natural resource such as water . </s>
the objective of this proposal for a directive , which date back to @card@ , be to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water , coastal water , inland water and groundwater . </s>
it provide a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystem , promote sustainable water use , help to fight flood and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substance . </s>
specific directive will then be adopt within this framework . </s>
the procedure involve in draft this text be lengthy . </s>
the proposal for a directive be amend twice , first in @card@ and then in @card@ . </s>
a technical working party make up of Council and Parliament representative meet in January @card@ to try and reconcile the position of the two institution . </s>
however , the Committee on the Environment have table numerous amendment , most of which I support . </s>
as far as the timetable and objective be concern , the Council 's objective be to achieve good quality surface water within @card@ year of the entry into force of the directive , while the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy want this reduce to @card@ year . </s>
the committee be also call for an end to discharge or leak of dangerous substance by @card@ , the final objective be to achieve zero input by @card@ . </s>
the Council hope to achieve good quality groundwater within @card@ year , but the Commission want no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieve in @card@ year . </s>
All the standard and all the objective relate to protected zone should be achieve within @card@ year , not @card@ . </s>
I must say that I support these reduce deadline , especially as provision be make for derogation . </s>
as far as cost be concern , I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by @card@ that water pricing policy provide incentive for more sensible use of water resource . </s>
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertake to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policy reflect the environmental cost and the cost in term of resource by @card@ . </s>
I will close by quote one of the amendment table by the Committee on the Environment , which need no further comment : &quot; water be not a commercial product like any other but , rather , a heritage which belong to the people of the European Union and which must be protect , defend and treat as such &quot; . </s>
. </s>
I wish to put on the official record my concern with the Lienemann report and also the reason for my vote . </s>
we have all agree on the need to put in place proper control for the protection of our water supply and also for the user of water . </s>
There be much to be praise in the approach to the problem suggest by the rapporteur . </s>
however , the question of taxation or charge for the use of water be a matter which , under the rule of subsidiarity , should be leave to the Member States for decision . </s>
in my belief it be incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue . </s>
in Ireland all the major user of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water . </s>
this be a decision of national and local government , and this be where all future decision should be retain . </s>
these be the main reason for my vote . </s>
. </s>
the European Union be currently in the process of adopt new Eu water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of exist water resource include river and coastal water . </s>
I support the objective of this community action in the field of water policy . </s>
however , I do not support the proposal that domestic water user be charge for water use . </s>
water , in this context , be a commercial commodity . </s>
it be an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supply for normal daily life . </s>
we see it as positive that an attempt be be make to reverse the trend towards water degradation , which be most alarming and which government all too often tend to sweep under the carpet . </s>
we all know that water be a commodity without which mankind can live and that it be imperative that its quality should be preserve . </s>
but it be also essential to bear in mind that the various element of water policy can be separate , and that action on this aspect will affect all the other . </s>
the &quot; physico-chemical and ecological quality of water &quot; be highlight during the debate and in the proposal , and the adverse effect of other aspect be , at good , touch upon marginally . </s>
it be essential to be aware of the widely vary situation in different Member States , such as specific climatic condition , water regime and fluctuation in them over the year , the social , economic and ecological effect of apply standard , and also of the failure to do so . </s>
it be because of our concern about these issue that we disagree with some of the proposal put forward by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and in particular those relate to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention pay to social and agricultural aspect , which be very important for a country like Portugal , which suffer from water shortage problem and also inadequate socio-economic development . </s>
but we also believe that , in many case , the proposal put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards , which be why we would like to see a vote balance between the various requirement in the proposal present to us . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) we be disappoint by the Council 's common position on this proposal for a framework directive . </s>
it be minimalist on a number of point , especially with regard to the date of entry into force of far too many provision and the number of , and condition for , implement the derogation . </s>
however , the main problem be with the definition of the objective which the European Union wish to pursue with this text . </s>
the objective be of course to create , first and foremost , a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplify . </s>
however the Union should be seek , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater . </s>
public health and the supply of drink water be at stake , as be biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural area and specie . </s>
from this point of view , the common position be weak . </s>
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council 's position , but I should also like that position to be equally credible . </s>
the &quot; zero input &quot; and &quot; zero pollution &quot; requirement , include for substance naturally present in water , be not realistic . </s>
I be not one of those MEPs who think that it be essential to adopt &quot; extremist &quot; amendment at second reading with the sole aim of gain room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiation with the Council of Ministers . </s>
on the contrary , I object to this systematically apply strategy . </s>
it damage Parliament . </s>
our message to our citizen and to the Council be muddle and lack credibility . </s>
overly strict , unrealistic environmental objective will not be apply because they be unattainable . </s>
be that the message we want to send out ? </s>
There be one other specific point which be dear to me : Member States should be able , if they so wish , to set up trans-national water transfer . </s>
this type of project comply with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity , which we have always defend , and , as such , should enjoy the widespread support of the European union in the context of the promotion of trans-European network and regional policy ( through the Structural Funds ) . </s>
I would like to remind the house that we adopt an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water network two year ago and I would be most oblige if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it have take on that report . </s>
. </s>
( ES ) we have see a report concern with water quality in Europe transform into an instrument of commercial war . </s>
we all agree that ensure water quality be a hugely important objective , above all , give the adverse effect of develop a model of accelerate industrial growth on the natural environment . </s>
it be clear that this model 's logic of private profit have be harmful , and therefore the ' polluter pay ' principle be a suitable way of deal with these consequence . </s>
however , apart from these principle , there be the consideration that water , as a common resource , can be subject to the rule of the market . </s>
surprisingly , I imagine with the good of intention , this ecological objective have become an instrument of commercial war by make consumer , and especially the agricultural sector , responsible for the price of installation and the procedure for ensure water quality . </s>
in fact , water become simply one more product subject to the law of the market . </s>
this mean that the neoliberal model now reign in the field of water . </s>
by fail to distinguish country and region where water be abundant , and be therefore not a problem , from region where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity , stifle the chance of any economic and social development , we be pervert the ecological principle and turn it into a weapon . </s>
in the same way it be somewhat ironic that we be hinder the possibility of share this commodity , which be scarce in some area , while region where there be abundant water be give advice on austerity with regard to its use , to those who live in drought area . </s>
as a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity , my vote have be consistent with what I have say , as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural region - although one with prospect - namely , the region of Murcia . </s>
. </s>
on behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party , I wish to indicate that while we have support the major part of the Lienemann report , we have certain reservation . </s>
the timetable set in the report of @card@ be unrealistic and impracticable , but the timetable set by the Council of @card@ be too far in the distance . </s>
we believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date . </s>
we have vote against Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater . </s>
we believe this requirement be unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involve in restoration to a near pristine standard . </s>
the forego be the reason for our vote . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) Water be a renewable but limited natural resource and need to be properly manage . </s>
the framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area . </s>
it have clear , ambitious objective . </s>
we share them . </s>
it set environmental parameter close to zero . </s>
but we feel that it would be wise not to set unrealistic deadline which neither our government nor our industry will be able to meet . </s>
we need a timetable , by all mean , but a more gradual timetable . </s>
the legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation , i. e. to stop discharge within @card@ year , would in fact mean a ban on all identify substance . </s>
such provision may well cause serious problem in cross-border area and in candidate country , thereby complicate enlargement . </s>
I should like , naturally , to refer to a specific sector to which I be very closely attach , i. e. agriculture , the main water-consuming sector . </s>
Agriculture must accept its share of ' polluter pay ' charge , and have in fact already start to do so , but account must also be take of its special characteristic and constraint , especially in arid region . </s>
as regard the amendment concern radioactive substance , I be of course in favour of control , but the question arise of the legal basis , which come under the Euratom Treaty . </s>
Andersson report ( A5-0033 / @card@ ) the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have not be able to vote in favour of the Andersson report . </s>
this do , of course , contain a number of good observation . </s>
for example , it be acknowledge on page @card@ of the explanatory statement that &quot; the different level of development and tradition in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States ' social security system &quot; . </s>
now , the concept of &quot; uniform harmonisation &quot; be one of those muddle expression which totally obfuscate the integration process in question . </s>
it be also true , as it state in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damage as &quot; it might place great demand on weak Member States at the same time as competitive consideration might exert pressure on more socially develop country to cut back on social security . </s>
no-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation &quot; . </s>
the situation , however , be that a social model be be establish whose real purpose be harmonisation , and uniform harmonisation into the bargain . </s>
paragraph D point out that &quot; the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criterion &quot; , and the report go on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process be to be promote by mean of joint talk between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils . </s>
finally , paragraph 7 emphasise that &quot; the social convergence process must be accompany by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination &quot; . </s>
and , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter . </s>
this project , with its social harmonisation , do not constitute social policy . </s>
instead , it be an extension to the Eu 's EMU project , which be of quite special interest to the three country which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sink ship , namely Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark . </s>
it be therefore important for us to emphasise that we can support a proposal whose essential rationale be to extend the EMU project . </s>
) Mr President , I vote for the Council 's strategy for modernise social protection because , in my view , it constitute a step towards the establishment of European social and pension legislation , although it do not actually go the whole way . </s>
I be sorry to hear what be say in the previous explanation of vote , since I believe that , in essence , the report aim to provide much good protection for the elderly , despite the fact that , as we all know , the government of the @card@ Member States would like to reduce pension to the minimum . </s>
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pension . </s>
the elderly be wait for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with great dignity than they do now . </s>
the country who have make less progress in this field should attain the same level as the country within the European Union that guarantee well social protection . </s>
. </s>
( da ) the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have vote today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague , Jan Andersson , on the Commission 's communication concern a coordinate strategy for modernise social security . </s>
the start point for the Commission 's communication be the implementation of EMU which , with its demand for stability and growth , create the basis for the Member States ' be able to maintain their social security arrangement . </s>
the report state that modernisation do not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , good use of available resource . </s>
we also notice that , accord to the explanatory statement , modernisation do not mean harmonisation of social security arrangement , either , and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place great demand on weak Member States at the same time that competitive consideration might exert pressure on other to cut back . </s>
no-one would benefit from this situation . </s>
both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson , it be emphasise that it be the Member States which have responsibility for and , therefore , also determine the content of , social security arrangement . </s>
cooperation on these matter within the framework of the Eu should create added value , base on the exchange of experience and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policy be develop , the aim be to define good practice . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) we consider that the report contain many practical proposal , which we support , but we be very critical of the convergence approach which permeate the report . </s>
in particular , we oppose the section which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission be become involve in tell the Member States what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) . </s>
we wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States , even if the enlargement of the Eu require a great degree of coordination than there have be in the past . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the current difficulty face by our social security system derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an age population rather than from excessive spending . </s>
the policy of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation . </s>
of course we need to modernise these system . </s>
in France , in particular , we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pension . </s>
we also need to reform archaic management method which create injustice , chaos and waste . </s>
more importantly , we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic , monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create job . </s>
the Commission and the Andersson report be not propose a social policy ; they be give Brussels exorbitant decision-making power as regard funding , I. E. as regard the organisation and the provision of social protection service in the country of Europe , which be why we vote against this text . </s>
social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it come first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state . </s>
social protection should be base on the principle of national and Community preference . </s>
otherwise it be merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of European citizen , of the intolerable social situation which result from immigration . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) we have abstain from voting for Jan Andersson 's report on a coordinate strategy for modernise social security . </s>
we be basically well dispose towards the European Union . </s>
as Swedish liberal , we see European integration as an opportunity to find solution to cross-border problem such as the environment , trade , movement across border , human right and conflict management . </s>
in these area , Europe 's democracy have a chance to show the world that cooperation lead to peace and increase prosperity . </s>
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decision be to be take as close as possible to those they affect . </s>
that be why we be actively pursue the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibility be clear for all to see . </s>
it must be perfectly clear to all citizen that the Eu will only become involve in those issue it be well qualify to deal with , which be to say cross-border issue . </s>
all other question ought to be deal with at local , regional or national level . </s>
social policy be an example of an area in which the Eu ought only to have limited power , except where it be a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union . </s>
each Member State ought to have full responsibility for , and the right autonomously to decide upon , its social security system . </s>
health care , child care and care of the elderly be clear example of area which be not obviously transnational . </s>
the same apply to labour market policy . </s>
we do not believe that common European legislation in these area be a solution to the problem involve in design system of social security . </s>
for us , it be important that the Eu should instead concentrate on just a few area in which it can really be of use . </s>
that do not , however , prevent the Member States from cooperate and exchange idea in the social sphere . </s>
equality and social security be issue which be traditionally high on our liberal agenda . </s>
we wholeheartedly support , at national level , many of the idea present in Mr Andersson 's report . </s>
. </s>
( it ) the report give a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernise social protection in Europe will be accompany by an analogous process of cohesion . </s>
we therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intention . </s>
numerous policy have already go in this direction , albeit laboriously , and many more still need to do so before Europe , in term of subsidiarity , be see as one house , not only by its own people , but also by those in the candidate country . </s>
moreover , the European welfare system have always play a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation . </s>
consequently , if such system be to continue to sustain development in the future , in light of the economic and employment change take place , as well as the requirement of society , modernisation be absolutely essential . </s>
There be three main aspect that need to be highlight . </s>
the first be that economic policy , employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that be directly proportional . </s>
the second concern the management of welfare system and those who operate them . </s>
nowadays , it be become more commonplace , as well as efficient , to operate complementary and integrated protection scheme . </s>
but , in our view , that do not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduce , either as regard the universality or , we hope , the quality of the basic social protection provide . </s>
it be , to a large extent , a principle of justice that imbue both health and pension scheme as well as social assistance , where , in particular , strategic coordination by the public authority be essential , even though it have be modernise . </s>
the third aspect concern the principle of subsidiarity that underpin the European Union . </s>
today , a common strategy for social protection be sadly lack , and the current system be , in the main , run accord to the action and unity of purpose of individual Member States . </s>
therefore , any modernisation process have to take account of economic , employment and social protection difference between the various country , whether Member States or candidate country . </s>
What be require be that those responsible for the modernisation process , which continue to be closely link to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlie difference , should have the will and the know-how to ensure that change be for the good and not for the bad . </s>
it be , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) the basic value common to the Member States of the European Union be base upon democracy , human freedom and right , and a social market economy . </s>
these value must be give expression in the form of solidarity with the weak group in our society and in the world around us . </s>
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it be the Member States themselves which devise their own social security system . </s>
inhabitant of country in the European Union ought , nonetheless , to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection , irrespective of which country they live in . </s>
the report seek &quot; effective and ambitious fiscal coordination &quot; , without go on to define more specifically what this mean . </s>
as we see it , such a position constitute unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and can , therefore , be support . </s>
we be therefore vote against paragraph 7 of the report . </s>
the report emphasise the social dimension of European cooperation , which be something to be welcome . </s>
it be nonetheless important to clarify what role the Eu be to play , and not to play , with regard to social security . </s>
clarification of this kind be miss from the report , which be unfortunate . </s>
. </s>
( el ) on read the Commission 's statement on social protection , which be animate by so many good intention , one wonder whether its author and the work people in Europe be live on the same continent and in the same social reality . </s>
one also wonder whether this ' coordinate modernisation strategy ' be not just another misrepresentation of the coordinate and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquire right of work people . </s>
we agree with many of the rapporteur 's remark but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission 's and the Council 's intention and plan concern social protection . </s>
the general line of the implement economic policy , the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programme , which be a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relation , and the organisation of labour , along with Commission and the ESF decision relate to salary and wage restraint , and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieve much-vaunted monetary stability at all cost , leave no doubt about the new strategy 's objective and aspiration . </s>
its sole purpose be to pave the way and create the right condition for cut public expenditure on social security , and for flexibilising social protection itself . </s>
when social security have repeatedly , and in the word of many influential people , be characterise as a ' cost ' and an ' obstacle ' to great competitiveness and when way be be seek to transfer that cost from company to working people - always , of course , on the pretext that this will create job - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability , with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interest , be to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizen to social protection and care . </s>
clearly , what be be attempt be to move away from organise system of social security under state control , towards system base on private insurance agency , which will generate new profit for capital and place even great burden on work people , who besides the high cost , will ' enjoy ' even more degrade social provision . </s>
the foster of illicit competition between public and private social security system and between the system of the Member States be not only unjustifiable , but , on the contrary , make manifest the political expediency and intolerable pressure impose upon social security system to weaken or even do away with them , to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit . </s>
it be well know that the level and quality of employment determine the quality of social security system . </s>
so how be it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security system when we be face with the million of unemployed , impoverished and marginalised people , the ' work poor ' of part-time employment , and work condition that be dissociate from the policy implement ? </s>
social security and protection be among the great acquisition of work people in Europe , and be achieve after many year of battle against the aspiration of big business , and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterise working people . </s>
today , in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment , it be urgently necessary to establish broad social protection and to extend the right of work people , but this demand a different system of economic and social development , which the Eu can possibly create , because of its nature and character . </s>
on the basis of these view , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the ' modernisation ' of the social protection system that the Commission statement be promote , and to make it clear that we can vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which be under discussion . </s>
that conclude the explanation of vote . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at 3 p. m. ) next session of UN Human Rights Commission ( continuation ) the next item be the debate on the Council declaration on the establish of the Eu priority for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights ( @card@ March @card@ ) , include the situation in China . </s>
Mr President , I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council . </s>
this be a Council declaration , and I believe that it would perhaps have be useful for them to have be present for the rest of the debate . </s>
I think it be worth remind you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflect the need , which have be express by all the political group , for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue , one which be so dear to this House . </s>
follow the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission , I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human right be far remove from what we would all like to see . </s>
at a European Union level we must recognise that the situation be not completely satisfactory , since , for example , although the convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental freedom be a common instrument in all Member States , not all subsequent protocol have be ratify or sign by all of them . </s>
another clear drawback in this area be the fact that the European Union itself be not a signatory to the convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental freedom , with all the additional disadvantage that this situation entail . </s>
I hope that these problem can be tackle and deal with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights . </s>
with regard to foreign affair , I believe that the majority of point which we have include in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism , Mr President . </s>
issue such as the abolition of the death penalty , the torture which still go on in many supposedly democratic country or the situation of minority in many part of the world , demand a clear , visible and effective response from the European Union . </s>
in my opinion , this resolution contain a series of essential point , but I would like to stress one in particular , that be , the need for great coordination between the European Union and the United Nations . </s>
Mr President , in a world such as this , which be increasingly dominate by the phenomenon of globalisation , and not only in the economic field , our response , in order to be effective , must be concerted and coordinate . </s>
in order to make our action effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which do not exist at present . </s>
this Parliament therefore advocate the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issue and , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible . </s>
soon , in May , the European Commission intend to present a communication on the development of the role of human right and democratisation in the Union 's external relation . </s>
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination , which I have just mention , and to seek new formula which will strengthen the role play by the European union in the field of human right and , in particular , by this Parliament , especially from the point of view of coherence , recognise the good will of those third country which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause . </s>
I believe that this should be apply to all area , in particular also the budgetary area . </s>
lastly , I must recognise the important contribution make by civil society in this area , as well as the often underestimate role of the numerous non-governmental organisation who act on the ground . </s>
the Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work . </s>
Mr President , Commissioners , when this House be call upon to debate human right it be take a chance , if you will , that be reinforce by the condition that prevail when we be call upon to discuss such a crucial issue . </s>
the absence of the Council , as well as of the majority of MEPs , show just how great the divide be between our noble , elevated and worthy formal statement and the concrete reality in term of our day-to-day policy when it come to human right . </s>
I believe that , as a beginning , Parliament be call upon to use the opportunity provide by the Geneva session to narrow that divide . </s>
it should adopt an approach that be not just a statement of principle but be an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support . </s>
we must get away from the situation where we be only aware of human right when they hit the headline or abuse be be punish . </s>
the role of Parliament be to meet the issue of human right head on , particularly at the level of prevention . </s>
in that sense , we need to be able to export a culture base on legality and respect for the law . </s>
it seem to me that we have finally reach the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaty appear and be duly sign . </s>
nowadays , there be many , perhaps too many , treaty on human right . </s>
if those treaty remain mere expression , they be no more than useless depository of people 's thought . </s>
the time have come to move on to a new and crucial phase , namely a phase in which the provision of the treaty be apply on a daily and binding basis , although we ought not forget that some basic treaty be still to be transpose . </s>
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that @card@ of the @card@ Member States of the Union have still not ratify the treaty establish an International Criminal Court . </s>
in my view , we should be evaluate and modify some of the political instrument we use to measure the status of human right globally . </s>
we have often employ instrument which , at the formal level , make us feel comfortable , but which , in term of practical result , be totally ineffectual . </s>
by that I mean the use , and often abuse , of embargo during recent year , and the over-cautious application of the clause allow suspension of the agreement between the European Union and third country , where there have be human right violation . </s>
in particular , we should be update the area where human right need to be safeguard . </s>
Globalisation could easily come to be regard as a harmful process . </s>
Many country be currently question the principle of the universality of human right . </s>
the belief be widespread that many human right , include the right to life , contradict as it be by the death penalty , depend on certain variable , while globalisation , which often have a negative connotation , be in danger of become the catch-all for right , action and policy everywhere in the world . </s>
we should therefore do what be necessary to update the area in which we can intervene , with renew strength , to safeguard human right . </s>
in that context I would mention the following : social right , worker ' right , quality of work , the need to ensure respect , where necessary , for all the criterion lay down by the International Labour Organisation , the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minority be entitle , particularly within the European Union . </s>
I would also mention the right to develop . </s>
it be the right of all people who , in turn , be the sum of countless individual each one of whom have the right to develop and to a future that , most importantly , be full of hope and personal growth , within each individual society . </s>
All those aspect should be part of a rationale , a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human right . </s>
I hope that Parliament 's participation in the Geneva session turn out to be more than just a token presence and that its representative do more than just listen to and give evidence . </s>
first and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspect I have just mention as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation , and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human right that transcend time and place . </s>
that be what we hope for and be the cordial message that we be send our government , even if it go against their interest . </s>
Mr President , even though the Chamber be fairly empty at the moment , Parliament have a very high profile within the sphere of human right . </s>
in this Chamber , we have express our concern and condemn regime which oppress , torture , execute and discriminate against their citizen . </s>
this commitment create unease and have an impact . </s>
we have see proof of this on numerous occasion . </s>
Two week ago , I receive a letter from the Chinese Embassy in Brussels . </s>
they express their consternation at the fact that our Parliament have condemn China and they devote ten page to explain that our criticism be base upon misunderstanding . </s>
this letter be only one example to show that what we do do not fall upon deaf ear , but be follow with close attention by the world around us . </s>
this be good and demonstrate the European Parliament 's important opinion-forming role . </s>
the Eu 's role be important . </s>
we must therefore have a consistent , clear and coherent policy within the sphere of human right . </s>
now , there really be reason to be concern about development in China , despite the letter from the Chinese Embassy . </s>
together with many other , this question will be discuss at the Geneva Summit in a couple of week ' time . </s>
we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party be extremely keen that the Eu should keep the flag fly and take vigorous action on this occasion . </s>
I be please when I hear Commissioner Patten 's observation on China , but a little concern when I hear the doubt express by the President-in-Office of the Council . </s>
a strongly word resolution on China would be an important mark against a country where there be systematic abuse of human right . </s>
member of the spiritual , entirely peaceful , but now ban , Falun Gong movement have again be subject to mass arrest . </s>
There be report of torture , solitary confinement and even execution . </s>
prison sentence of many year be be hand out to people without trial . </s>
hundred of member of the group be be send to camp for &quot; re-education &quot; . </s>
this be wholly unacceptable . </s>
There be also persecution of other group such as Protestants and Catholics . </s>
China maintain that it respect freedom of religion , but all too many case of violence against , and harassment of , religious leader indicate that the opposite be the case . </s>
nor be there any sign that the situation in Tibet be improve . </s>
There be still alarm report from Tibet about torture , imprisonment and persecution . </s>
basic human right be not accept in China . </s>
nor be freedom of expression , freedom of assembly and freedom of organisation . </s>
nor be there freedom of information now . </s>
in recent week , China have do all it can to restrict access to the Internet and to prevent citizen from communicate with , and receive information from , other country via the Internet and e-mail . </s>
All this show that the situation be distressing , and there be of course many possible strategy which could be adopt . </s>
dialogue be one way , but it be not enough . </s>
we ought not to allow ourselves to be deceive by a situation in which China take token action at the eleventh hour in order to create the appearance of improvement take place . </s>
the Geneva Summit be an important opportunity for other country to tell China that systematic abuse of human right be not acceptable . </s>
Mr President , one of the save feature of this Parliament be that here we practise a consistent and active human right policy : the flag fly high , as Mrs Malmström put it . </s>
at the same time , however , we shut our eye to the Union 's own problem : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which be part of everyday life in the Eu . </s>
it be absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violation of human right that be to be the subject of talk in Geneva . </s>
the rhetoric that we use , however , often smack of smugness , verge on the sort of narcissism we associate with human right attitude in North America . </s>
it be nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human right that occur in non-EU country if we be not prepare to extend a help hand to those genuine refugee and asylum-seeker , whose position be now become more difficult in the Eu . </s>
let us , in particular , focus attention on the re-admission clause , which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be block . </s>
unless we can maintain high standard of human right with respect to refugee and asylum-seeker , we be not worthy of those European value which make up the European identity , as Vaclav Havel say here today , and among which he particularly mention respect for human right and solidarity . </s>
I work for many year on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it be really move to see how a nation in such difficult circumstance be reach out for a more open , European-style , pluralistic democratic society . </s>
I fear that we be now move in the opposite direction , towards European exclusiveness and apartheid . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in my view , the question which need to be raise in Geneva this year be certainly not the death penalty . </s>
we have already have three resolution on the death penalty approve in Geneva . </s>
we fail at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext , I refer to article @card@ , which we be otherwise happy to adopt for all other text . </s>
the question of the death penalty should therefore be raise at this year 's General Assembly , certainly not at the Geneva session . </s>
as Mr Patten say , and I would like to thank him for the position which he defend , the crucial point be China . </s>
unfortunately , the position take by the Commission and the Council , or at least the presidency , be more than just a hair 's breadth apart ; this be serious , especially in the light of the Council 's macho position on Austria . </s>
in my view , as far as China be concern , and know that the European Union 's policy towards China have be a total failure , allegedly constructive dialogue have get us nowhere or , worse , it have give the Chinese new pretext for increase repression and for strengthen religious repression and the repression of freedom ( as Mrs Wallström have say with regard to the Internet ) in all sector , in Tibet , in inland Mongolia , in eastern Turkistan . </s>
There be regression in every sector of Chinese civil society . </s>
it be a fact : China be the major threat , the major threat to us , the threat which we must confront , the threat to peace . </s>
it be the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese , the Chinese leadership , be communist first and Chinese second . </s>
China like doublespeak . </s>
until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authority . </s>
I think we need to seize the opportunity . </s>
we need to associate ourselves with the American initiative . </s>
we need to table a strong text and that text need to be adopt . </s>
we need to work . </s>
the Fifteen need to start work right now , with all the member of the United Nations ; we need , at long last , to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiate position . </s>
Mr President , I would like to try to put a different perspective to this . </s>
as you know , on Monday an unmanned spacecraft go into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid call Eros which be not very far from earth . </s>
photograph show us that there be no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our galaxy , the Milky way , there be about @card@ billion star , many with planet . </s>
beyond the milky way there be @card@ billion other galaxy with countless star and planet . </s>
it be probable , therefore , that there be a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we be . </s>
bear in mind that the first television programme from earth be now @card@ light year out into space way beyond the near star , I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the star think of us as they look at us . </s>
What do they see ? </s>
they see a beautiful planet , teem with life , but they see its atmosphere be polluted and warm up . </s>
they see forest be cut down and desert spread . </s>
of the live creature , they can see many animal that be treat cruelly , rare one become extinct for ever . </s>
How do they see the currently dominant specie - that be us ? </s>
well , they see the planet 's resource be unevenly spread . </s>
they see land be fight over , medicine for disease but not in the part of the world where it be most want , book for school - but not at all in the least-developed area of our world , @card@ % of the world 's population never make a telephone call in their whole life . </s>
What do they see about the relationship between human being ? </s>
they see us kill each other . </s>
they see us restrict each other 's liberty . </s>
they see a never-end series of local war . </s>
they see some of our child draft into the army as soldier , or treat as prostitute or slave . </s>
they see unequal treatment of man and woman , of people of different age , of minority , of people of different coloured skin , of race , of belief , of immigrant , even neighbour . </s>
we all know the picture . </s>
the UN Convention on Human Rights @card@ year ago be an attempt to correct this . </s>
we should salute it - and I think we do . </s>
only in Europe be human right enforceable in law . </s>
here in the European Parliament some of the member do not want the Charter of Rights , which be be discuss at the moment , to become enforceable in law . </s>
I say : shame on them ! </s>
human right should be enforceable in law in every country of the world . </s>
that be the goal which we have to work towards . </s>
much , as Commissioner Patten say , remain to be do . </s>
finally , if you ask me : What if there be no life out there among the star , what if we be alone ? </s>
- which be an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say : do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our child behave properly , before let them go out to populate other planet ? </s>
Mr President , human right be universal , indivisible , interrelate and interweave . </s>
this well-known phrase , which be take from the conclusion of the UN World Conference on human right of @card@ , be know off by heart by many . </s>
that be positive . </s>
but what about the human right policy within the Eu itself ? </s>
do it reflect this vision of coherence ? </s>
in fact , do the European Union have a human right policy ? </s>
this question do not challenge the effort make by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoint on foreign policy into line and to display a unite front against violation of human right elsewhere , for example in China . </s>
no , Mr President , I be talk about the lack of human right policy within the European Union itself . </s>
a new government have come into power in Austria , comprise a political party which have send out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minority . </s>
human right , which the Eu embrace , be thus under threat , but the reaction to these event have bring to light the fact that there be no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulate . </s>
the widely quote Article 7 of the Treaty , which provide for the repeal of membership right from a Member State where serious and continuous violation against human right have be establish , be , of course , only a kill or cure remedy , an ultimum remedium , which , in the case of Austria , can only be quote in the absence of anything more effective , and by way of warning . </s>
There be , therefore a need for a fully-fledged human right policy for and by the European Union , a policy which promote and enforce human right within the Eu itself . </s>
such policy should comprise various component . </s>
firstly : a regulatory framework be need , which spell out very clearly the right which the Eu intend to secure for its citizen . </s>
a start be now be make on the draft of such a charter , but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learn professional jurist . </s>
this be a political question which , in the short term , require an answer from the IGC and this Parliament . </s>
secondly : a range of instrument have to be develop which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark . </s>
the follow spring to mind in this respect : the systematic collation of documentation and information , professional form of observation , the development of information campaign , the use of cash to support democratic force in the country concern , a more creative deployment of the resource which be available through multilateral diplomacy , such as organise dialogue and fact finding mission and such like . </s>
thirdly : it will need to be make clear for each of the Eu institution where the responsibility for human right policy lie within the European Union and what the task and competence be that this entail . </s>
the Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be . </s>
this Parliament be exclude from this , for our rule of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carry this responsibility . </s>
but I be somewhat surprise that the resolution which should bring this debate on human right to a conclusion have be prepare in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee , of which I form part , have not be involve in this . </s>
Mr President , this Parliament be fragment and divide . </s>
for the sake of our credibility , we will have to speak with one voice when it come to human right and not act as if human right within the Eu be different from human right elsewhere in the world . </s>
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee . </s>
Mr President , what will it take to make the debate on human right something other than what it be today : an ideological instrument which help to enslave people rather than free individual ? </s>
we must start by go beyond man , who be not the master of the universe , to the source of all genuine right and civilised value , without which the eternal claim to right always end in tyranny and bloodshed . </s>
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i. e. to the creation , and beyond that still further , to the creator 's intention . </s>
then we shall see that the right of the child be only respect within a proper family , the right of worker be only respect in the intermediary body which we have recently destroy and that citizen ' right be only respect within sovereign state . </s>
secondly , the doctrine of human right must no longer be exploit , as it be today , as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hand of a cast which claim the right to decree unilaterally who be to be the arbiter of human right and who be to be deprive of those right , thereby deny the legitimacy and , if need be , the freedom of those whom the party line have deem politically incorrect . </s>
' no freedom for the enemy of freedom ' be what the advocate of the revolutionary Terror be say two century ago , the advocate of the revolution which prove , alas , to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regime . </s>
no human right for the enemy of human right be what the acolyte of the new world order be say today , the new world order which reign almost unchallenged in financial circle , in international institution , in the medium and cultural network , and in educational institution , to mention but a few . </s>
What be leave , for example , of the right of Austrian to choose their own destiny , if that choice be dictate on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be do and if their duly and legally elect leader be receive in an insulting manner , as they be recently by you in Portugal , Mr President of the Council . </s>
I do not know if he be still present and can hear me . </s>
What be leave of the human right of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok , one of the most important party in the Flemish region , if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopt the implausible , indecent and ignominious bill table by its main political rival , the Volksunie , which seek quite simply to abolish the party ? </s>
What be leave of the right to engage in a critical study of history when author and publisher be persecute , as the young historian Jean Plantin be just yesterday before the Court of Appeal , in my home town of Lyon - he be the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive close speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout , the smug expression of straitjackete thinking and intellectual conformism ? </s>
it be a strange concept of human right when peaceful patriotism be fraudulently equate with aggressive nationalism , when legitimate protest against immigration policy be equate with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identity be equate with racism . </s>
What of the human right of the million of French people who vote for the National Front and who be deprive of any political representation and vilify daily , as they be on Monday on the television channel of the state to which they be require to pay taxis , when the simple expression of justifiably exasperate view by one of our colleague , Mr Le Pen , be use as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation , in violation of the law and in violation of all notion of justice , fairness and moral , and when attempt be make , in violation of the clear legislation , to deprive this representative of million of our fellow citizen of the mandate which he have be give by their vote , not receive as a favour from the government . </s>
in a word , I shall believe your talk about human right in Europe , fellow member , when you acknowledge that your political opponent have the same right as you allow yourselves . </s>
I shall believe your talk about human right in China when you name the real cause of the problem , i. e. communism . </s>
listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans , in which he say that the main cause of the weakness of Western society be excessive pander to legal individualism , an individualism which , far from allow people to flourish , pave the way for future dictatorship , in fact the bad kind of dictatorship , because those whom it enslave be not even aware of their terrible servitude . </s>
Mr President , the principle of universal human right be undoubtedly one of the most important political legacy of the 20th century . </s>
the holocaust , fifty year ago , lead to the need to lay down a number of fundamental right and freedom . </s>
since the end of the cold war , compliance with human right have also become a condition for international cooperation . </s>
leader violate these principle now face international criticism , sanction and be even bring to trial , such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experience . </s>
these development be encourage but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human right in the world remain very disquieting . </s>
especially in situation of war , civilian be give less consideration all the time . </s>
it seem contradictory . </s>
never before in history have humanitarian right be so well develop . </s>
never before have so many international treaty be ratify by so many country . </s>
yet the most basic rule of conduct be be flout on a massive scale and there be more civilian victim than there be a century ago . </s>
woman be systematically rape . </s>
child be conscript by force and deploy in battle . </s>
excess be no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule . </s>
this apply today to no few than thirty conflict worldwide . </s>
too late , too selective and too fragmented : this be how one could describe the human right policy of the international community . </s>
first of all , the policy come too late . </s>
both in Rwanda and Kosovo , the UN , despite the many warning , appear to be overtake by event and stand by as a helpless observer of the massacre , as President Havel point out this afternoon . </s>
fifty year later , we be still unable to prevent genocide . </s>
we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency . </s>
control of the arm trade and improve medium control be essential in this . </s>
the human right policy be also too selective . </s>
the month of NATO bombardment of Kosovo and the mediation attempt in the Middle East be in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflict in Africa . </s>
I can shake off the impression that , when it come to human right , despite all the rhetoric , Africa do not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
this be something which I very much regret . </s>
the impression that African get , namely that they be inferior world citizen , be not unfounded . </s>
I would like to warn against a blur of standard in the assessment of human right situation in Africa , where violation be view as a necessary evil . </s>
but above all , the human right policy be too fragmented . </s>
we be unable to draft a common strategy within the international community or Europe . </s>
take Sudan . </s>
the international community be send conflicting message to this country . </s>
Britain have re-opened its embassy in Khartoum . </s>
Canada have invite the Sudanese for peace talk . </s>
Europe put the rebel in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time , Americans isolate the regime and support the rebel at military level . </s>
There be a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raise bid be avoid . </s>
only then can we follow in the footstep of the founder of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . </s>
Mr President , I would like to start with the fact that if word could solve the problem we could all pack up and go home . </s>
but unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber , human right abuse be occur throughout the free world . </s>
sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motion : word ; convention : word ; treaty : word - if we be not careful , word themselves become a substitute for real action . </s>
word frame in inclusive and liberate document become treaty and convention which be often parade as a testimony to a country 's respect for and adherence to human right . </s>
yet word speak , write or sign be not in themselves enough . </s>
look at the signatory to the convention on human right and minority and then compare the treatment receive by such minority , group and individual - the list be shameful and shame . </s>
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that woman be treat equally and fairly , that child have human right or that people be not discriminate against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ? </s>
the defamation of minority in newspaper and other medium fuel discrimination . </s>
even within the Eu citizen still suffer human right violation and a breach of our convention . </s>
every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation be use to deny some minority equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minority . </s>
quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression have be create . </s>
and so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human right will be erode . </s>
in our enlargement process in the Eu we have rightly place the emphasis on human right and the protection of minority . </s>
we must not waiver in that commitment . </s>
but we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacy . </s>
yes , convention have be sign , but action be need . </s>
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human right practice , eternal vigilance , not just outside our border but within . </s>
that be why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charge against it and the action take . </s>
because what happen in each Member State happen to every single one of us . </s>
What happen in another part of the world affect us . </s>
Pinochet in Chile be as relevant as Haider in Austria . </s>
human right and civil liberty be inextricably link . </s>
human right do not exist in isolation , they be connect to our development policy , our economic policy , our home affair policy , indeed they be at the very heart of our democratic function . </s>
I would repeat what Mr Patten say : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change . </s>
Mr President , &quot; Europe stand for ideal , value and principle . </s>
we must emphasise Europe 's spiritual history . </s>
together , we must re-establish the value which unite Europe . </s>
spiritual value have be disseminate from Europe throughout the globe . </s>
we must live with our conscience . </s>
&quot; these be the word speak three hour ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic , Vaclav Havel . </s>
in an extraordinarily edify speech , characterise by wisdom , historical knowledge , an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe 's spiritual and Christian heritage , he point to source of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity . </s>
we should be grateful that there be Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe . </s>
I wish to discuss two matter . </s>
first of all , civil society . </s>
Vaclav Havel state that , in Eastern Europe , the communist regime methodically destroy civil society : national movement , church and the independent trade union . </s>
the same be happen in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant church . </s>
it be happen with Buddhism in Tibet . </s>
we must never forget to defend civil society . </s>
I also want to mention the death penalty . </s>
like my own country , Sweden , the Eu base its view of human being upon the equal , unique and inviolable value of every human . </s>
on the basis of this principle , human being should always have the chance to redeem themselves . </s>
try tell that to the government of the United States , Russia and China . </s>
Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the approach of Eu Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situation in Kosovo , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Sierra Leone and China . </s>
in relation to China , we should not be dissuade from raise the issue simply because discussion on it may be block . </s>
however , it be imperative that the Eu speak and act as one , and threat of trade sanction should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve . </s>
however , if full expression be to be give to the decision which may eventually be take at Geneva , then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provide with the necessary resource . </s>
the financial resource of the United Nations be spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programme be dependent on voluntary contribution to keep them afloat . </s>
resource be also need for promote practical cooperation and human right , strategic planning , the establishment of priority and strengthen communication between the donor community and member state of the United Nations . </s>
To this end the High Commissioner recently launch an annual appeal for USD @card@ million to enable her office to carry out these task . </s>
the European Union and its Member States should take the lead in provide a significant portion of these fund . </s>
in so do , we would not only embarrass the United States into shoulder its responsibility in relation to UN funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defend human right be more than simply empty rhetoric . </s>
Mr President , this debate be mainly concern with the preparation for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission 's and Council 's effort in this respect . </s>
I would first of all like to say that I be very please with the contribution make by Mr Patten and the Minister , and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba be on the agenda . </s>
Cuba be the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this , with all due sympathy to Cuba . </s>
it be a dictatorship and hence not a democracy . </s>
I would , during my two minute , like to draw attention to two country which be close to my heart . </s>
the first country be Indonesia . </s>
we be naturally delighted that Indonesia be under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri be the new President and Vice-President . </s>
we be also please that the situation in Timor be slowly move in the right direction . </s>
but I can report that in the Moluccas , an area just north of Timor , the violence be still not under control . </s>
this have claim thousand of life over the past two year . </s>
ten of thousand of people be on the run . </s>
the situation be badly manage . </s>
I know that tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , an important programme will be show on Dutch television , in which an appeal will be make for observer . </s>
this be with the sole purpose of monitor what exactly be go on , so that at least a record can be make , not least for the future , for human right committee , of what have be happen . </s>
my urgent request , which have be echo many time in resolution , be the follow : could you not confer so that observer can be send to the Moluccas ? </s>
surely thousand of people kill , thousand wound and ten of thousand on the run be enough . </s>
my second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten know this country very well - be Burma . </s>
surely we can just keep silent about Burma . </s>
I have the feeling that that country be gradually be relegate to oblivion . </s>
for ten year now , the elect President of that country have be under house arrest . </s>
and for ten year now , its parliament have be out of action . </s>
numerous MP have be kill or have flee the country and only a few be leave in Burma . </s>
There be hundred of thousand of refugee in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seem that that country be no longer give any attention . </s>
in my opinion , Burma should be put back on the agenda , too , certainly in the wake of Indonesia 's U-turn . </s>
surely we can tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San sui Kyi feel completely leave in the lurch , even by Europe . </s>
my request be , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , economic clout can be the only factor that determine the European Union 's status in the world . </s>
One of the Eu 's distinguish feature be our systematic approach to human right , as exercise both within the Union and by our partner . </s>
the European Parliament have be at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human right , and it have succeed in overcome the limit impose by self-interest and &quot; national interest &quot; , which be sometimes reflect in the position adopt by the Member States and even by other European Union institution . </s>
we can therefore safely say , for example , that the European Parliament have never allow the situation in East Timor to be forget , which could have be the great obstacle to find an equitable solution for its people , who always oppose occupation by Indonesia . </s>
by the same token we have recently oppose arm sale to Indonesia , a stance that the Council unfortunately do not take into account . </s>
but it be not just a question of prevent or put a stop to sickening instance of aggression perpetrate by individual or institution against those in a weak position . </s>
it be vital that when violation be commit , the perpetrator should not be able to act with impunity , whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola , in Cuba , China or Burma , whether the perpetrator be civilian or soldier , humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister . </s>
Justice need to be do in Indonesia . </s>
Justice need to be do in East Timor . </s>
President Wahid need our support to cope with the difficult situation he be face with . </s>
the specific reference in this resolution to East Timor , on the initiative of the PPE Group , be a timely one . </s>
someone must be hold to account for the event that take place there , some of which I see with my own eye as a representative of this House ; they can go unpunished . </s>
it be impossible to talk about East Timor without mention the ten of thousand of Timorese refugee live on Indonesian soil in inhumane condition , under the control of Indonesian soldier and militia , and be use as bargaining chip . </s>
this be an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , I would like to make a few very brief comment on behalf of the Council presidency , and first to remind you that the work do by the presidency be above all about coordination and about seek common position on initiative that the fifteen Member States be to approve in the Council . </s>
our experience of previous session of the Human Rights Commission suggest - precisely by virtue of this coordinate role play by successive presidency - that the European Union be very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission , and it be important to maintain this . </s>
I would also like to say that the European Parliament 's participation in the preparatory work be important in establish coherent European Union position on various different issue , and that the presidency therefore naturally welcome all the various suggestion and in particular all the contribution make through the resolution which have be present . </s>
I would also like to stress , as many member have highlight , that human right policy be at the heart of Europe 's identity and that respect for human right should be see as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union . </s>
hence the need for the most coherent European human right policy possible , which of course mean that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous position where we consider a state of affair to be unacceptable , and I have in mind , in particular , the reference that many member have make to China . </s>
but we have also duly note the concern express by many other member about other country , notably Indonesia , East Timor , the Moluccas and Burma . </s>
I could not conclude without mention Mr Van Hecke 's speech in particular , in which he refer to the human right situation in Africa and to the role and priority of the Portuguese Presidency , and question the sincerity of the priority we be give to relation with the European Union . </s>
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency have , in these two short month , organise the first Development Council , admittedly an informal one , whose agenda be rightly dominate by EU-Africa relation . </s>
indeed it be this subject which lead the development minister of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussion specifically on the new era these relation have enter . </s>
furthermore , I can stress enough the significance of our have conclude important negotiation on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention , and the fact that , follow extremely complex and difficult negotiation , we have succeed in organise - or make preparation for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit . </s>
for all these reason I think it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke 's question on this issue . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , this have be a very useful debate . </s>
One or two speech have refer to specific issue which we be well advise to think about very carefully . </s>
for example , Mrs Maij-Weggen refer to both Indonesia and Burma and make some important point about both those country and the human right situation there . </s>
What I would like to focus on very briefly be one or two theme which run through our debate . </s>
One of the very first speaker , Mr Wuori , speak of the remark make early today by Mr Havel . </s>
it be a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch , who be no longer able to be with us , be able to hear that speech as well . </s>
I also hope that , if there be any life in outer space , as have be speculate by Mr Newton Dunn , it be tune in to Mr Havel 's speech as well . </s>
Mr Havel remind us that the Union be not just about market , about GDP growth , it be a union of value that be reflect in the treaty and be reflect in our obligation in the whole area of external assistance , reflect quite specifically in what we be charge to do . </s>
How do we implement what the treaty say in all those word about development assistance programme ? </s>
One or two honourable member , Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan , speak about the gap between rhetoric and reality . </s>
Mr Cashman say , which be right in a sense , that word be no substitute for real action . </s>
of course , word can make a bit of a difference , a point that be make by Mrs Malmström . </s>
she say that she have receive a letter from the Chinese Ambassador , a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country , to tell her that she be wrong and the European Parliament be wrong in its attitude on human right in China . </s>
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letter from the Chinese authority . </s>
she will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letter about what be claim to be the real situation in China . </s>
I think she be reflect the view of many non-governmental organisation , many people who admire Chinese civilisation but be concern about what be happen in China today . </s>
of course it be entirely right that we have to look at action , and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mention two issue apart from Geneva which represent action , one of which be of course make possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that be the budget that we be able to spend on human right activity - about EUR @card@ million that be spend through programme , for which I be responsible , mainly go to non-governmental organisation to promote human right and to promote democratisation . </s>
we will want to share with Parliament , as vicar say , our view on how that spending programme to support human right can be well focus and well target in the year ahead . </s>
There be also the question which be refer to by Mr Salafranca , who I be sorry be unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate . </s>
There be also the question of our overall policy on human right and the relationship between human right and foreign policy . </s>
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publish , before the middle of the year , a comprehensive , intellectual case for place human right at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy . </s>
it be immensely important , and if I have not think that already , have listen to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion . </s>
it have be a useful debate . </s>
I hope we can have further debate like this . </s>
I hope we can have , in particular , debate about some of the way in which we translate these good intention into practice on the ground where it matter , where people be still be torture , where people be still be rape and be still be deny the sort of civil right that this House take for grant , as I do . </s>
I have receive 7 motion for resolution , pursuant to Rule @card@ ( 2 ) , to close the present statement . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place on Thursday . </s>
Cyprus and Malta the next item be the joint debate on : the Council statement on the position of the European union on development concern Cyprus ; the report ( A4-0029 / @card@ ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operation in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0308 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ] . </s>
Mr Seixas da Costa have the floor on behalf of the Council . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union , I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiation and recent development in this area . </s>
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the event in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relation between the European Union and Turkey have create a new backdrop , at Community level , which we can ignore when it come to relation between the two Cypriot community . </s>
at the beginning of December @card@ , the first round of negotiation be hold in New York , after an interruption of several year in negotiation between the Cypriot community in the north and south of the island . </s>
these negotiation take the form of indirect discussion mediate by the UN special representative , Álvaro de Soto . </s>
a further round be hold in January this year , start on @card@ January , and a third round be schedule to start on @card@ May in New York . </s>
There be a possibility , which have not yet be absolutely confirm , that continuous and direct discussion may take place , with work continue until September this year . </s>
these discussion essentially cover four area : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustment and issue relate to refugee and compensation , as a result of the situation follow the partition of the island . </s>
however , agreement have also be reach on the possibility of include other issue , and the representative of the northern part of the island , Rauf Denktash , have suggest three new topic : sovereignty , confidence-build measure and the issue of lift the embargo on product from the north of the island . </s>
the discussion hold so far have essentially result in two development . </s>
the first be the possibility of open up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island , without this necessarily signify recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level , but as a means of facilitate adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island , if a solution can , in the meantime , be find to the broad problem of the partition of the island . </s>
the second development which we regard as important be the statement make by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day 's discussion to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island . </s>
this be the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis . </s>
certain expectation exist about the third round of negotiation , in view of the propose scenario be prepare with the involvement of representative of the United States and the United Kingdom , in particular in the area of security and the constitutional structure , which it be envisage will be present at this round through the good office of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations . </s>
this will take place after the election in the north of the island schedule for @card@ April . </s>
furthermore , the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union have decide , follow the example of previous presidency , to appoint a representative to establish contact with the various party involve in this issue . </s>
this representative have already contact all these party and have , in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , be monitor and assist with the work of the various round . </s>
in particular , we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue , and of course all the more so since Cyprus be a candidate for membership of the European union with negotiation at a fairly advanced stage . </s>
this naturally raise certain expectation and mean that the role of the European Union be of some relevance in this context . </s>
the approach that we have be follow in these discussion , and our participation in them , essentially turn on take advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tension that exist , base on a conviction - which appear to be widely share - that it be necessary to continue to negotiate , and that continue negotiation and maintain their impetus also give rise to hope that a definitive solution can be find . </s>
There be also another important aspect which I refer to at the beginning of my statement , and this relate to Turkey 's role in help the north of the island to prepare for accession . </s>
we believe that it be not only necessary to read the conclusion of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention , but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authority to help to resolve this situation . </s>
I be able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visit Ankara myself , and although we be aware of the difficulty and sensitivity associate with Turkey 's particular approach to this question , I believe that there be a window of opportunity that we must not miss . </s>
this window of opportunity involve combine various factor , one of which - and let us be frank about this - be the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union . </s>
this be key as regard the future of this issue . </s>
on the other hand , we think it be important - and this be also link with the way in which the European Union relate to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriot in the north of the island should be encourage . </s>
this would not , let me make this quite clear , imply any kind of formal recognition . </s>
nevertheless , we believe , and I think this be also how the Commission see thing , that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European union through accession at some point in the future imply involve the community in the north of the island as soon as possible . </s>
it may also give the European Union access to datum enable it to justify accession , as part of its effort to assess accession condition . </s>
furthermore , this mean that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission 's involvement in this undertaking . </s>
it be essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area . </s>
lastly , I believe - and this be also the presidency 's intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations , give the skilful , intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General , and the UN organisation in general , have conduct these discussion , and in particular the way they have endeavour to help to harmonise the two party ' position . </s>
as I say at the beginning , the conclusion of the Helsinki European Council last December have have a visible impact on the way the position of the various party to this process have develop . </s>
the Nicosia Government have express its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusion , which open up the way to accession to the European union without solve the partition of the island beforehand . </s>
nevertheless , I have to say that the same authority have express their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issue raise by partition , which will evidently imply some concession . </s>
this be relate to development in the sphere of displace people and the possibility of a new arrangement regard displace people should a different solution be find for the island . </s>
on the other hand , the Turkish Cypriot fear - and there be no point in try to conceal this - that Turkey 's application for membership of the European Union may lead to great flexibility in Ankara 's position on this . </s>
I believe that , despite the fear that may be feel by the two community on the island , these point , which could be view in a negative light by the authority on both side , may in the end justify hope of an ultimate solution . </s>
it be very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspect of relation in this area at present , which be the extremely positive trend in relation between Athens and Ankara and the very important part play in these relation by the Greek Foreign Minister , Giorgios Papandreou , and the Turkish Foreign Minister , Ismail Cem . </s>
we believe that this have create the framework for a positive outcome . </s>
as far as we , the Council presidency , be concern , we will continue to follow these development very closely , and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter . </s>
we will make the Community institution aware of what we be able to do , and what be possible in general , as regard coordination , not just at political level but also as regard what the Commission itself can achieve in term of its scope for manage the accession process . </s>
in particular , we will make know the flexibility that both party have demonstrate on this issue . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , today 's debate concern an issue that be particularly important in two respect . </s>
whilst in the first place , our discussion have to do with deliver financial aid to Cyprus and Malta , so as to enable them to play a full part in the pre-accession strategy , it be also concern in no small way with the peace process in Cyprus , and thus with stability and security in the Mediterranean region . </s>
firstly , I would like to say a few word on the financial regulation for Cyprus and Malta , which the Commission put forward in October last year . </s>
I be exceptionally grateful to Mr Brok , the rapporteur , the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , for his report , which form an excellent basis for our deliberation today . </s>
we need this instrument . </s>
it replace the financial protocol that expire at the end of @card@ . </s>
we need these instrument so as to be able to meet our financial commitment under the term of the development strategy for Malta and Cyprus . </s>
I be very grateful for the fact that Parliament be support the Commission in its effort to adopt the draft regulation as quickly as possible . </s>
the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets have put forward a series of propose amendment . </s>
the Commission be able to adopt some of them . </s>
I would like to comment on two point that I know be very dear to Parliament 's heart . </s>
first and foremost , we be talk about the financial package itself ; i. e. how much money do we actually want to spend ? </s>
the Commission will propose a package of EUR @card@ million . </s>
the Council have also agree on this figure . </s>
I be aware that Parliament would like it to be a large amount and I fully understand why this be so . </s>
I can assure you that , as the competent Member of the Commission , I too would very much like to have more money for this purpose at my disposal . </s>
but it be simply the case that we be unable to achieve consensus for a large amount at the present time . </s>
at the end of the day , it be the budgetary authority that must establish the final amount . </s>
the second important issue in this respect relate to the transfer of the financial means under line 7 of the budget . </s>
in fact this only appear to be a technical issue . </s>
it be very much a political issue . </s>
I myself have already say here , on another occasion , that I consider this to be the right approach . </s>
I believe I can safely say - notwithstanding the fact that the Commission have not reach a formal decision yet - that in principle the Commission be prepare to go along with this suggestion . </s>
however , the aforementioned decision can be reach via this regulation ; this can only be do under the term of the schedule revision of the Financial Perspective . </s>
this regulation , which cover the period from @card@ to @card@ , afford both applicant country access to technical and financial support for the implementation of the acquis communautaire , for involvement in Community programme and certain of the Community 's institution , and for extend the authority of their administration system and court of the propose total amount of EUR @card@ million , EUR @card@ million be earmark for Cyprus and EUR @card@ million for Malta . </s>
in the case of Cyprus , the draft regulation also provide for the financing of measure intend to support reconciliation between the two ethnic group , and in fact this account for a third of the total amount . </s>
on behalf of the Commission , I would like to guarantee that the programming for the fund will take place in accordance with the priority of the accession partnership as early as in the course of the next few week . </s>
now just a few brief comment on how the Cyprus question have develop since the European Council in Helsinki . </s>
I wholeheartedly endorse the statement under-secretary of State , Mr Seixas da Costa , make here on behalf of the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
we be cooperate closely and to good effect on this issue . </s>
as far as Cyprus be concern , it have always be the Union 's contention that the accession negotiation should benefit the effort be make to find a solution to the political problem . </s>
indeed we always support this view , and I be quite convince that it be appropriate for the negotiation on the resolution of the political problem to take place under the auspice of the United Nations . </s>
and we be always agree that the solution should continue to have as its aim a bicommunal and bizonal federation . </s>
it be still the European Union 's goal to admit a unite Cyprus . </s>
the European Council in Helsinki reiterate that resolve the political conflict would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union . </s>
Nonetheless , as the presidency have just say , the Council have make it clear that this be not a pre-condition for the conclusion of negotiation . </s>
Should it not have prove possible to find a political solution to the Cyprus question by the time the accession negotiation be conclude , then the Council , take all the relevant factor into account , will take a decision on whether or not Cyprus should gain admittance to the Union . </s>
that be how matter stand on the political front . </s>
the Helsinki European Council 's decision on how relation between the European Union and Turkey be to be frame in future have give the situation considerable impetus . </s>
I would emphasise that several political process be run in tandem here and they be closely link . </s>
in the first place , this be all about the relationship between the Eu and Turkey . </s>
it also concern the further development of relation between Greece and Turkey , and the peace process in Cyprus . </s>
There have already be talk of the ' window of opportunity ' , which have present itself follow Helsinki and on account of the détente between Greece and Turkey . </s>
and so what can we do to make use of this window of opportunity as far as Cyprus be concern ? </s>
I believe we must adopt an intelligent and cautious approach . </s>
if we set about this with too much gusto then we will raise expectation we can fulfil , and so I favour an intelligent , softly softly approach which be sensitive to the need of the give situation . </s>
the first thing we be able , and want , to do be to step up dialogue and communication between the two community on Cyprus . </s>
that be an ambition that find favour with our Greek and Turkish partner . </s>
therefore , we want to give the so-called bicommunal activity renewed impetus , in particular those involve young people . </s>
we should also give more attention to make sure that the Turkish Cypriot community be well inform about the Union 's aim . </s>
I be absolutely convince that , if the people be to have a good understanding of the Treaty , in fact a good understanding of what the European Union be all about and what its ambition be , this could help to eliminate fear and prejudice . </s>
I will be go to Cyprus in mid-March , and I aim to do my bit towards convince both community of the benefit renew cooperation will bring . </s>
for our part , we have make fund available for this purpose in the new financial regulation . </s>
these fund be not inconsiderable . </s>
I believe it be very important for us to call upon both side to at last break free from the shadow of the past and gradually develop a new form of cooperation and , ultimately , a new way of live together . </s>
the talk hold under the auspice of the United Nations take place in New York in December and in Geneva at the beginning of February . </s>
they will enter the third and perhaps crucial round in May . </s>
negotiation should certainly continue until such time as a solution be reach , or at least until substantial progress have be make on the major issue that the presidency have just highlight . </s>
What should the Commission 's role be in this ? </s>
it be interesting to observe how all those who be party to this process deem the European Union 's role to be of central importance . </s>
All the player be seek contact and cooperation with us . </s>
they be well aware that the peace process and the adoption of our common accomplishment be inextricably link and must not come into conflict with one another . </s>
I have to say that I too prise cooperation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his special Representative on this issue extremely highly , and can tell you that it be progress smoothly and in a spirit of trust . </s>
one be therefore right to conclude that the resolution of the Cyprus question have gain renewed impetus since Helsinki . </s>
I would not wish to go very much further in my assessment at the present time . </s>
the Union 's decision to commence accession negotiation and to move them on apace , which be intend to act as a catalyst to resolve the political problem , still appear to me to be the right course of action . </s>
in any case , I can see no alternative to this approach that be even remotely reasonable and therefore , it just remain for me to say that the Commission will stick to this line and play its part in attempt to resolve the political problem until the accession negotiation be conclude , use the accession negotiation themselves as an important instrument in the resolution of the conflict . </s>
. </s>
( de ) Mr President , I be very grateful for the two announcement and statement that Commissioner Verheugen have already make on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of measure within the framework of the pre-accession strategy . </s>
There be no doubt that we must treat Malta and Cyprus as two candidate that must be accord the same right , politically , and also in term of the pre-accession strategy , as the ten other state with whom we have commence bilateral negotiation . </s>
I be sure that no one in this House doubt that it would be extraordinarily helpful in the process , if it be to prove possible to find a solution to the Cyprus question , and it be also clear that the European Union must play its part here . </s>
if the outcome of these negotiation be to be a unite Cyprus of the kind outline by the Commissioner , which be in a position to join the European Union , then we could count this a huge achievement . </s>
on the other hand , we must also make it clear , of course , that there be other option , so as to avoid the possibility of create something awkward that will ultimately land us in difficulty of the kind that will have us run into obstacle and remove our power to act in the overall enlargement process . </s>
it be already clear from the various option that , in the context of the overall enlargement process , this will be one of the most delicate issue if not , ultimately , the most delicate issue , which we can perhaps expect to produce the most serious political difficulty . </s>
I also consider it to be extremely important that this pre-accession strategy be be pursue in such a way that both community in Cyprus be already be bring closer together . </s>
in comparison with the other applicant country , Cyprus , like Malta , be a relatively rich country overall , but it must still be treat equally in some respect . </s>
we should turn this equal treatment of Cyprus to good account , so as to prevent the economic and social disparity between the Greek and the Turkish sector become great still and ultimately reduce the likelihood of unification even further . </s>
To my mind , that be why this pre-accession strategy have a special significance . </s>
therefore permit me very briefly to raise those point that Parliament deem important . </s>
I would like to thank the Commission for have adopt a clear stance with regard to categorisation within Category B7 , insofar as it be able to in the previous decision-making process . </s>
I hope that the Council will also take the necessary leap and submit these statement , for the European Parliament be well aware that this be a political issue . </s>
it follow from this that the pre-accession strategy will be homogeneous and even-handed in its approach , and we should also ensure that it be possible to quote total figure up until @card@ , so as to guarantee a budget 's reliability , clarity and veracity in this respect as well . </s>
owe to the manner in which this be handle hitherto , it can be bring into line with a normal budgetary process . </s>
I believe it be important that the European Parliament have make a positive contribution for this year nonetheless , because we do not want these country to be disadvantaged in any way , and that be why we be prepare to make the necessary decision for Budget @card@ , but this can really only apply to this year . </s>
that be why it be important for the Council Presidency to draw up an appropriate statement , in the course of the deliberation over this report , which will enable us to transfer this issue to an orderly process , so as to end what to my mind be an unnecessary row . </s>
I fully understand that problem of a mathematical nature may arise on account of Agenda @card@ and the funding that might be at our disposal . </s>
I would also like to state quite clearly that we could perhaps even discuss the figure of @card@ million that be mention in my report . </s>
Parliament have also table an amendment for tomorrow base on a different amount , particularly as these country be at a relatively advanced stage of development , as I say . </s>
however , these country must be able to feel secure for the foreseeable future ; they must know what be actually in store for them , and this must also be reflect in the European Parliament 's planning ability , as part of the budgetary authority . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I know that you be still full of good intention regard cooperation with the European Parliament . </s>
I hope that the council as a whole will be of the same mind and that you will be able to give us the right answer to these question . </s>
Mr President , we have listen to the statement by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the follow observation . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I appreciate the sensitivity with which you be address the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side , but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use do not leave one suspect that you might be attempt some kind of indirect recognition , even though you stress that this be not the case . </s>
for example , I would not refer to the government of Nicosia . </s>
it be the Cypriot government , Mr President-in-Office , not the government of Nicosia . </s>
that government have propose a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part , and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiation conduct by the Republic of Cyprus . </s>
on the other hand , the way that the issue of the end of the protocol and the pre-accession strategy have be address so far create some doubt for us . </s>
I can understand why the two small country must be treat differently , nor why a clash be necessary between the institutional body . </s>
nor can I understand the pressure apply by Parliament to include the fund in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy . </s>
How can the whole of the European Union treat , in this way , two small country situate on its periphery ? </s>
not only be they country which the European Union need , but they be also country which be fully qualify to operate within the Union and be already consider capable of participate in economic and monetary union . </s>
as the Commissioner say , and I agree with him , it be a matter of political decision . </s>
this be a small political decision which would bring major benefit , especially in help the two community effectively to constitute one state , to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two community be once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus , genuinely , to be rid of occupying force . </s>
Mr President , we be require under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operation within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta . </s>
this proposal be similar to the proposal submit for other candidate country and , once it be implement , will replace the financial protocol which have now expire . </s>
Pre-accession instrument be design to provide technical and financial support for effort by candidate country to meet the demand of the Community acquis . </s>
the Commission 's analysis have in fact show that , although classify as high income country by the World Bank , Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulty as the CEECs in transpose Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity . </s>
it be point out , during the discussion of Mr Brok 's excellent report in committee , that both country can also benefit from the Meda budget line for horizontal project of regional interest . </s>
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that . </s>
as far as Cyprus be concern , part of the technical and financial aid provide for in the instrument will be use to bring the Greek and Turkish community closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all . </s>
the declaration make on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission be therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen . </s>
since 4 July @card@ , when Cyprus apply to join the Eu , the European Parliament have pass numerous resolution call for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations . </s>
in April @card@ , Parliament again reiterate its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island , and help towards a political solution , but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution . </s>
in other word , accession should not be hold hostage to a political solution . </s>
the two process be separate process . </s>
this unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament give rise to a certain degree of controversy . </s>
we must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and state in its conclusion , and I quote , that &quot; if no settlement have be reach by the completion of accession negotiation , the Council 's decision on accession will be make without the above be a precondition &quot; . </s>
the position be clear and we must now hope that the improve climate surround relation between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representative to the accession negotiation . </s>
the presence of these representative will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever . </s>
on the contrary , it will allow the interest of all concern to be highlight as and when Cyprus join the European union and prepare for a turn point in its history . </s>
Mr President , I want to say that I share the other rapporteur ' delight at the fact that good opportunity be now to be glimpse for make further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relation between Turkey and the Eu and between Turkey and Greece . </s>
however , I also think that we in the Eu should be make a constructive contribution . </s>
I also think - as have already be mention - that there be certain problem with the financing arrangement , which we must solve . </s>
There be , of course , the question of pre-accession aid , and this belong in category seven . </s>
last year , Parliament make an exception by agree that this expenditure should be place in category four , and the two applicant state be not therefore be treat on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe , as they , in fact , should be , accord to the declaration from the Helsinki Summit . </s>
resource should therefore be set aside from category seven , where a review of the financial perspective must be carry out . </s>
this be the crux of the matter . </s>
the main point be that the money for Cyprus 's and Malta 's pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspective for , if the Council do not endorse this view , it be in reality act in conflict with its own decision in Helsinki in December . </s>
with regard to the amount which be quote in the Brok report ( EUR @card@ million ) , I also want to say , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , that we must negotiate our way towards find a sum of money . </s>
the most important thing be that a multi-annual programme be guarantee , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin make plan where Cyprus and Malta be concern . </s>
Mr President , the Group of the green / European Free Alliance support the decision adopt by the European Council in Helsinki accord to which the resolution of the conflict can be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union . </s>
we should continue to exert strong pressure on the government of Cyprus , but one section of the population can blackmail the wish of the majority . </s>
besides , we have strong doubt as to how representative the government be of that part of the island be . </s>
it be clear that the window of opportunity mention by the presidency should be exploit to the full . </s>
but we be also convince that , despite improve relation between the Turkish and Greek population , it be not enough . </s>
the conflict in Cyprus will only be resolve through improve relation between the two community with a view to establish a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future . </s>
in particular , we should be work towards establish genuine freedom of movement and resolve the problem of demilitarise and disarm the island . </s>
the European Union should be take a more decisive role that go further than merely provide financial support , although that be important , by promote and guarantee reconciliation between the two community through the set up of fora and confidence-building programme . </s>
I must say that Alex Langer 's presence here in the European Parliament be sadly miss . </s>
his effort to build peace should serve as an example , to all of us , on how peaceful coexistence can be achieve . </s>
Mr President , the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot community under the aegis of the UNO remind us of the fact that , @card@ year after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army , nearly @card@ % of the territory be still occupy by @card@ @card@ soldier , heavy weaponry be still be use and over @card@ @card@ colonist be still present , in total violation of the resolution by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter . </s>
What can the European Union do , without interfere in internal affair in Cyprus , to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which have be associate with the European community for nearly @card@ year and which be due to join the Union within the next few year ? </s>
I have listen to the somewhat equivocal talk and silence on the part of the Council which , in my view , need clarify . </s>
I think that we need , first and foremost , to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such case in mind , I. E. the resolution of the United Nations . </s>
the Security Council feel that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be seek within the framework of a two-zone , twin-community federation , in other word a single state , as Mr Verheugen mention , consist of two local administration elect by the two community . </s>
Cyprus should be one sovereign state , with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarise . </s>
the international community have thus indicate that it reject any act accomplish by force . </s>
secondly , the European Union stand to gain , in my view , by minimise the scope for interpretation of the position lay down by the Helsinki European Council . </s>
the solution to the Cypriot problem can be a precondition to Cyprus 's accession to the Union , as Mr Poo have remind us . </s>
if it be , Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union , which be , of course , unacceptable . </s>
thirdly , we must not , in turn , allow the position take by the Helsinki European Council to temper our effort to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus join the Union . </s>
from this point of view , the other decision take at Helsinki , namely to grant Turkey candidate status , give the Fifteen new responsibility as well as new possibility and its dialogue with Ankara can and , in my view , should , include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrate a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot community which respect international law and which will ultimately lead to a unite Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean . </s>
Mr President , there be a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta be important . </s>
the big question , however , be from what budget head should this aid be finance ? </s>
the Council and Commission have suggest delete the protocol under category 4 . </s>
this be in line with the budget order issue by Parliament in December last . </s>
the rapporteur be now make reference to this and propose class Cyprus and Malta under category 7 . </s>
the Committee on Budgetary Control have even suggest postpone approval of the Brok report until the Council agree to increase the financial ceiling for category 7 . </s>
this be an extremely risky strategy . </s>
in fact , the financial protocol can go ahead without a vote in Parliament . </s>
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victim of a political game between the Council and Parliament regard the height of the ceiling . </s>
moreover , what be the real significance of financial ceiling if they be increase for every new action ? </s>
I would therefore advocate that the EUR @card@ million in category 4 be drop , in line with the Commission 's proposal . </s>
a multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year , may give a decisive answer regard credit for the come year . </s>
Mr President , all over the world work be be do to resolve long-standing conflict and bring together community divide by history and by old tribal enmity and hatred . </s>
now be the time to devote our time and energy to aid Cypriot from both side of the &quot; green line &quot; in find a solution to a conflict which have last for far too long . </s>
we all know that special care be need to ensure that Cyprus be bring successfully into the European Union , and the decision take at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate , with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country . </s>
I hope that the decision take at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue . </s>
I hope this signal a new era of hope for Cyprus . </s>
I hope that Turkey begin to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue . </s>
I be delight to hear the word of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it be do in encourage proximity talk between the two community to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two community in Cyprus . </s>
I very much welcome the Commission 's support for that bizonal , bicommunal , federal Cyprus for which the UN have campaign for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be work hard to bring about . </s>
I welcome the renewed warmth in relation between the Greek government and the Turkish government . </s>
I hope that have an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talk . </s>
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus be use partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuild of trust and that both side of the divide community in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it be give . </s>
we all , throughout the European institution - in Parliament , the Council and the Commission - should be do our good to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which bring together these two community which have be divide for too many year . </s>
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend warm thank to the Council Presidency , to the act President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Seixas da Costa , and to Commissioner Verheugen , for their statement on Cyprus . </s>
I welcome with open arm the fact that both underline the European Union 's desire to try harder to resolve the Cyprus question . </s>
for we all know that it be unacceptable that this island have be divide since @card@ and that approximately @card@ % of Cyprus have be occupy by Turkey for more than @card@ year . </s>
in the past , any attempt to resolve the Cyprus question by peaceful mean founder on the entrenched attitude of the Turkish side , the Turkish Cypriot leadership that be . </s>
but as you yourself make clear , we have just enter the year @card@ and may find that we be face a new situation , possibly with new opportunity . </s>
first of all there be the United Nations ' new activity , which have already be mention , then there be the new activity to be undertake by the US government , and there be clear rapprochement between Turkey and Greece . </s>
in particular , however , as I see it , we ought to be able to expect a breakthrough follow the Council decision take in Helsinki . </s>
the Union admit Turkey to the circle of applicant country in Helsinki . </s>
at the same time , it be decide that the accession of Cyprus to the Union would not be make conditional on the resolution of the Cyprus question , which , as Mr Poo say , be actually already the clear position of the Union and also Parliament , and this be confirm in various resolution . </s>
therefore , Helsinki have leave Turkey in no doubt whatsoever as to the fact that it have no right of veto regard the accession of Cyprus , and that the further deepen of its relation with the European Union be closely bind up with the resolution of the Cyprus question . </s>
it be therefore very much to be hope that smart politician in Ankara will recognise the opportunity that end the Turkish occupation of Cyprus would also bring for Turkey itself . </s>
I sincerely hope that- as someone here say - this window of opportunity will be open very wide indeed and that representative of the Council and of the Commission will continue to work to this end with the Turkish government . </s>
unlike Mrs Frassoni , I do not believe that the Cyprus question be just about different community of people , rather it be quite fundamentally about Turkish politics . </s>
I think we can assume that , where Cyprus be concern , the Eu accession process be irreversible . </s>
and we all hope that it will be a unite Cyprus that join . </s>
hence another request for clarification from you , Mr President-in-Office of the Council : you have speak of involvement on the Turkish Cypriot side . </s>
have there be any indication that the Turkish Cypriot side intend to accept the offer make by the Cypriot government or by the European Commission , or that it intend to take up this offer to join the talk ? </s>
secondly , I welcome with open arm the fact that this week , on the basis of the Brok report - and thank you very much for this report , Mr Brok - we also intend to concern ourselves with the financial aspect of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta . </s>
for it be absolutely crucial that , when the financial protocol with Cyprus and Malta expire , we make financial aid available for country to adapt to the acquis communautaire . </s>
both country be very far from be the poor of the applicant country . </s>
nevertheless , it be in fact crucial for Malta and Cyprus to make headway on the adaptation front . </s>
Cyprus expect to have to spend around EUR @card@ million - which correspond to almost @card@ % of their own GNP - on adaptation activity between @card@ and @card@ . </s>
consequently , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy have pronounce itself in favour of increase the EUR @card@ million that have be set aside . </s>
and I very much hope that we will genuinely have opportunity to increase this amount . </s>
as for the Cypriot , Greek as well as Turkish Cypriot , it be to be hope that we will be able to pour considerable resource into the planned measure for bicommunal cooperation that Commissioner Verheugen mention earlier , so as to achieve the goal of bring the two ethnic community together again . </s>
my final question to Commissioner Verheugen be as follow : have there be any sign that there be more chance now of bicommunal contact be establish on Cyprus than there be at the time of Luxembourg ? </s>
There be no chance whatsoever of it happen at that time because Denktaº veto it . </s>
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Verheugen , the regulation on accession aid be not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission . </s>
rather , the way in which these aid measure have be cobble together smack of amateurism to me . </s>
this apply both in term of the substance and the financial aspect . </s>
in my view , it will hardly enable us to present the accession activity conduct by the Union to the citizen of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it be worth their while join . </s>
as Vaclav Havel rightly say today , the European Union will be judge on its political quality accord to what it can do for the individual . </s>
as far as the citizen be concern , it be what a regulation can do for them that matter . </s>
we will not exactly win any award with this regulation as far as that be concerned . </s>
it be makeshift and contain heteronomous paragraph , which be no way to set a shine example . </s>
the quality of an aid package be assess accord to the follow criterion : be it decentralise , be it transparent , be it accessible to the citizen and do it work ? </s>
Nonetheless , as far as the divide island of Cyprus be concern , overall , this pre-accession strategy be bind up with a major political challenge . </s>
in my view , it be the task of the European Union to employ all instrument , include this one , so as to contribute towards resolve the conflict on the island by political mean . </s>
I must take this opportunity to say that it be precisely the amendment submit by the European Parliament that be so important to me in this respect . </s>
both the Commission and the Council have be make very optimistic speech here today as well . </s>
I be delighted that we be all head in the same direction in this respect . </s>
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problem in Cyprus before admit this country to the European Union . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the view of the Greek Communist Party be that the main problem of Cyprus be not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of @card@ % of its territory by Turkey , which have continue for @card@ year . </s>
regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot , the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country . </s>
the only acceptable solution that guarantee the future , that leave no room for foreign intervention , like those that lead to all the problem of the last fifty year , be a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolution of the UN 's Security Council . </s>
the key to solve the Cyprus problem be in the hand of the Turkish government , which support and encourage the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº . </s>
for its part , the European Union , with its hypocritical profession of interest in freedom and human right , have never be move by the drama of the Cypriot people , by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugee , by the enforce change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus , or by the wholesale settlement of colonist by Turkey in the occupied area . </s>
even in this Chamber , the Council 's representative refer to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territory . </s>
the recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status , even though it have make not the slight concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus , for example , by reduce its military presence there or give back Ammokhostos , be clearly encourage Turkey 's intransigence . </s>
it be not by chance that , immediately after Helsinki , the Turkish Prime Minister , Bulent Ecevit , state that the Cyprus issue have be resolve in @card@ . </s>
encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly do not help to bring the two community closer together in the intimate talk under the aegis of the UN Secretary General . </s>
on their course towards accession , the people of Cyprus have already lose a great deal , but stand to lose even more . </s>
the application of the acquis communautaire have create serious problem for the Cypriot economy , especially in agriculture . </s>
it entail the liquidation of the public sector , and it dislocate and destroy the develop system of social solidarity that exist in Cyprus . </s>
Mr President , I beg your pardon , but the French interpreter make a small error , on the most sensitive word in the debate , during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just say . </s>
I just want to ensure that there be no ambiguity . </s>
Mr Alyssandrakis be translate as say &quot; the confederate solution would be good &quot; . </s>
obviously , he say &quot; the federal solution would be good &quot; . </s>
it be a most important point and need to be clarify , Mr President . </s>
thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz . </s>
Mr President , Malta and Cyprus be very different from the country of mainland Europe . </s>
the Maltese in particular have be very good at survive in hostile geographical and geopolitical environment . </s>
their success have rely in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility . </s>
Malta have vibrant light and heavy industry , grow financial service , good agriculture , magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunity , all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resource . </s>
I be certain , therefore , that an island such as Malta , with its population of @card@ @card@ can accommodate the rigidity of the economic and legal structure of the mainland which have a population a thousand time great . </s>
thus , when I look at this propose instrument I do not see a measure to bring two people into the fold of Mother Europe . </s>
the situation be more akin to a black hole in space , suck in mass so powerfully that not even light escape . </s>
we should not be bribe these island people to cooperate in their own destruction , give them money to absorb law which be as alien to their culture as a black hole be to Mother Earth . </s>
the Eu should leave Cyprus and Malta alone . </s>
it seem to me that the only people in Malta that want this be the political class , and I shall be keep my finger cross that once again the Maltese people be the winner . </s>
Mr President , this be one of the few occasion when , from what the speaker have say in this Parliament , from all side of the House , there be clearly the great convergence of view on the Cyprus issue and , of course , on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta . </s>
this mean that we be all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem . </s>
at the same time , however , it mean that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate , so that the strength of opinion express by all the European party , and all the people , can empower their political ability to address the problem . </s>
Helsinki be an historic event , an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point . </s>
if , for any reason , the balance achieve there should be consider by some to be a point of departure for new negotiation anywhere else , if some people destabilise this totality of fact and equilibrium by their attitude , they will be make a tragic mistake . </s>
condition be ripe . </s>
What be need from the European Commission , the Council and everyone else , be a quiet determination , a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiation on both Cyprus and Malta without guile , grant that in the last analysis they be the most mature of all the country seek accession , so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about . </s>
To this end , the Brok report be a good instrument and it be really a bit distressing that , because this be a joint debate , it be politically overshadow by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we can therefore say more about this good report . </s>
in any event , the outcome be in your hand . </s>
the outcome be in our hand to the extent that we be provide you with decision , to the extent that we be provide you with option . </s>
now , as regard the Brok report , Cyprus and Malta be the last of the Mediterranean island , and , unless I be mistake , the last island anywhere in Europe which have not accede to the European Union . </s>
this have a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its island - and I too come from an island - be the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holiday get to see , as well as the people who live there . </s>
from that standpoint , Aphrodite 's island , as Cyprus be know , and the pirate ' island , as we islander say of Malta with great affection , be two jewel which should be welcome into the European union without delay . </s>
they have healthy economy , high-level economic relation , and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union 's political will . </s>
in conclusion , since I do not think I need to say much , give the unanimity that exist here , I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office . </s>
I think that there be some peculiarity in his position . </s>
I hope there have be an interpretation error , and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech . </s>
Mr President , I be the last of the speaker and for that reason I should like to put a question to Mr Seixas da Costa and to Mr Verheugen , if Mr Verheugen will kindly put on his headphones and if he be interested in hear all the speaker . </s>
grant , it be an issue concern two community , but it be not mainlyan issue concern two community . </s>
as many speaker have say , we have a state of occupation ; occupation by a country apply for membership of the European Union - Turkey - of part of another country that be also apply for membership . </s>
There be @card@ @card@ troop and a modern-day Berlin Wall in Nicosia nowadays . </s>
we can predict what will happen purely on the basis of the talk between Mr Denktaº and the President of the Republic of Cyprus . </s>
the question I want to put to Mr Seixas da Costa mainly , but to Mr Verheugen as well , be what issue will the Council be raise with the Turkish government , bear in mind the Association Council too , in connection with this matter ? </s>
What issue will it raise concern the withdrawal of troop and the Turkish government 's contribution towards resolve the Cyprus issue ? </s>
I remind you that , in a recent decision by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , the Turkish government be censure . </s>
not Mr Denktaº , not something with no legal existence , the ' Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ' , but the Turkish government , for its appropriation of Greek estate . </s>
I ask you : what issue be to be raise at the Association Council concern Turkey 's contribution towards resolve the Cyprus issue ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , I have listen to your comment very carefully , and in particular to the rather emotional comment about Cyprus , especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus , which the European Union specifically acknowledge by recognise the relevant resolution of the United Nations Security Council . </s>
Mr Wurtz , in no way can it be say that the Council be maintain an ambiguous silence about this issue : the Council assume total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus . </s>
moreover , it be this situation and this interpretation which lead the Council to take the decision it take in Luxembourg at the end of @card@ , when it decide to take the first step in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union . </s>
I hope that honourable member will realise that , regardless of the more or less emotional statement make about issue of this kind , the day-to-day reality of international negotiation normally force government to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say government I mean all government . </s>
in fact we need more emotional statement to remind us that all these issue have a human side . </s>
but we also need to be aware that it be by virtue of rational political stance , and flexibility in negotiation , that we be able to find solution to the major dispute which have ultimately lead to many tragedy in history . </s>
regardless of who be to blame - and we be not here to apportion blame , the relevant United Nations resolution in this area be clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunity that the new situation be open up , in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one . </s>
the European Council in Helsinki have the courage to take certain decision , and I believe that various aspect of these decision have already recognise the real value of these opportunity which , as I say at the beginning of my first speech , represent a window of opportunity . </s>
we will not achieve concrete result during this stage of negotiation , which be a delicate and sensitive phase , by exploit tension . </s>
no , we should continue to make progress by work discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit . </s>
the European Union 's position on this be crystal clear , and I do not think it be worthwhile second-guess particular phrase in the Council 's conclusion or in any other statement . </s>
we do not play at political correctness in this House : we be concern with fairness at international level and with concrete statement on this issue consistently define by the Council over a period of time , and which the European Commission have also follow carefully , attentively and pragmatically . </s>
so when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchange of information , particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union , we need to be aware that we be try to find practical formula that will enable us to overcome the obstacle stand in the way of a political solution . </s>
we be not try to deceive anyone and we be in no way try to use practical solution to create a model imply political recognition . </s>
I believe that , over time , the Council of the European Union have clearly demonstrate that this be not how it see this issue . </s>
decision have be take by the Council with a great sense of responsibility . </s>
we believe that Helsinki be very clear in this respect . </s>
the authority of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognise that our relation with them regard their accession to the European Union have be positive . </s>
There be no point in second-guess or try to second-guess our intention . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate , which all in all I have find to be encouraging and supportive , and it have also show that there be a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission . </s>
however , I would be more than please to elucidate a few point as request . </s>
I will turn firstly to matter pertain to heading 4 and 7 . </s>
it be quite simple : a special head , namely , the famous head 7 , be create in Berlin , as part of the large Agenda @card@ package , for the applicant country of Eastern and Central Europe , which be currently undergo a process of transformation , and for these country alone . </s>
Malta , Cyprus and Turkey be not provide for at this stage . </s>
Mrs Schroedter describe this as a lack of coherence . </s>
she ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council , who be not exactly a stranger to you , how this presumed lack of coherence have come about . </s>
I have have a little to do with this too . </s>
I do not believe this to be the case . </s>
the reason for this decision be , rather , that we want to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which , like Malta and Cyprus , be involve in the accession process , but under different condition . </s>
nevertheless , I have say that I understand the argument that people have be put forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspiration , but since this be all about Agenda @card@ and the Financial Perspective , we will not be able to do this without amend this Financial Perspective . </s>
hitherto this have be out of the question of course . </s>
by way of clarification : if we transfer it across from head 4 to head 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget . </s>
if we do this , then head 7 would be increase accordingly but head 4 would be decrease by the same amount . </s>
the idea that head 7 could be add to in this way and head 4 leave alone , be not workable . </s>
Parliament be no more able than anyone else to spend money that it have not get , at least not until we have a printing machine install in the basement that we can use to print euro note ! </s>
as for the peace process in Cyprus and how it be link with the accession negotiation , I would reiterate that there have always be a direct connection between the two . </s>
the Commission and the Council have long endeavour to encourage the two community in Cyprus to undertake joint project . </s>
so far , as you know , this have prove unsuccessful , and I have be ask if there have be any sign to the contrary . </s>
Mrs Rothe , I would put it this way : I be convince that there have be a distinct improvement in the framework condition for reach agreement of this kind . </s>
I do not have confirmation of this at present , and nor do I expect it , since we have not yet hold direct talk . </s>
these will take place at a late date . </s>
the framework condition have change in that the Helsinki decision make a whole range of thing possible that be not possible hitherto , and , above all , in that the political strategy employ by the party concern have change beyond recognition . </s>
I have always believe that the old line - i. e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstance until the political conflict have be resolve - have a weak point in that it do not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves , for , with this strategy , the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait . </s>
There would then be no question of Cyprus accede to the Union . </s>
as matter stand , Turkey have to take seriously the fact that there be a risk of Cyprus be integrate into the European Union , and this would provide opportunity for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community , whose level of prosperity be already far low , would fall even further behind . </s>
therefore , it be my firm belief that , since Helsinki , there have be far great incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict . </s>
indeed that be the idea behind it . </s>
after only a few week , Mrs Rothe , it be still too early to deliver a verdict on this , but in any case , I have no ground for assume that the new line will fail . </s>
as yet , we have no ground for say that we will actually succeed , but one thing I can say quite clearly be that the condition that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improve considerably . </s>
finally , of course , the Cyprus question have a role in the discussion with Turkey . </s>
I meet the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few week ago and naturally I ask if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue . </s>
I would just make one point : we can be @card@ % sure - I be not at any rate - that one only have to press a button in Ankara to set the wheel in motion in Cyprus . </s>
it be very far from be that simple , rather we be go to have to make concentrated effort , during talk with both community , to encourage them to reach an understanding . </s>
that be what we intend to do : the necessary measure and programme be in place . </s>
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that have yet to be decide on here , before we can even get start . </s>
the financial regulation be the legal framework we need to tackle the priority establish under the term of the accession partnership with Malta and Cyprus . </s>
I can start anything while there be no regulation in place , because I lack the legal basis for do so . </s>
if the lament lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point , then I be bind to say that this regulation be a legal framework and nothing more than that . </s>
this legal framework be flesh out in the priority set by the accession partnership that be adopt by the Commission and the Council last year and be now be implement in the corresponding programme and project management . </s>
on the contrary , I would say that , although many area of European policy leave something to be desire in term of coherence , in this instance I would claim , on behalf of the Commission and the Council , that we have develop a very clear , transparent and coherent policy . </s>
. </s>
( de ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , now that the Commissioner have explain to us , in an extremely coherent manner , that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bear responsibility for the lack of coherence , perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves , so as to enable us to take this decision . </s>
it would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my question on the Financial Perspective up until @card@ and on head B7 , or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intend to make effort of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence , which be something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission . </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , I be sure that the issue raise by my friend Elmar Brok will be consider by the Council . </s>
I feel that the criticism make of the previous presidency be not appropriate . </s>
I believe that the work do by the previous presidency in define the financial outlook be excellent , regardless of who be involve in that work . </s>
in any case , the question that this raise be an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposal that the Commission have present in this respect . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , as I understand it , Mr Brok be actually refer to an early presidency still . </s>
Mr President , I ask Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument Meda but he have not provide an answer . </s>
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various propose amendment we have before us . </s>
forgive me Mr Poo . </s>
There be a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me . </s>
this be how matter stand with regard to Meda : Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programme , but not in the country-specific one , because the income be too high . </s>
thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place on Thursday . </s>
question Time ( Council ) the next item be Question Time ( B5-0009 / @card@ ) . </s>
we will examine question to the Council . </s>
question no 1 by ( H-0022 / @card@ ) : subject : control access to Community water for oil tanker in connection with the accident involve the oil tanker Erika off the French coast , which produce a large oil slick , what step do the Council intend to take to control access to Community water for tanker fly flag of convenience which do not meet Community safety standard ? </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , on @card@ January the Council consider the consequence of the accident the previous month involve the oil tanker Erika . </s>
at that time , bear in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequence of this accident , the Council make know its concern about the safety of oil tanker and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it . </s>
the Council be fully aware of issue of this kind and of the need to take additional measure in this field . </s>
it emphasise the importance of the Council take new measure within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisation . </s>
as you know , as currently frame , Community legislation require port authority to carry out inspection on board all foreign vessel , include those fly flag of convenience , and to detain them if they do not comply with international standard . </s>
There be a directive date from @card@ on this subject . </s>
with regard to the future , the Council note that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tanker and of new proposal to strengthen control , together with provision on the qualification of inspect agency . </s>
There be also plan for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tanker visit Community port . </s>
these dossier will be progress by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you , on behalf of the Council , that we will not fail to give the high priority to the proposal , which there be every indication the Commission be due to present in this area , which we regard as be a vital part of environmental protection . </s>
this House will of course also be invite to give its view on these proposal , give that these be matter subject to the codecision procedure . </s>
I be please that the Council be consider this question . </s>
the President of the Council come from a country , Portugal , which be directly at risk from just this type of situation . </s>
if we stretch our imagination , we could envisage a situation where , between now and next summer , an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstance off the Algarve , wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry , with a bit of luck the sea current would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore , wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well . </s>
do the President of the Council not think that we should stop talk and implement tough measure in this area , bear in mind that we now have the mean to control this type of oil tanker on the high sea ? </s>
of course , the story of the Erika seem comical . </s>
a French-owned ship , under a Maltese flag of convenience , an Indian crew , a sea-worthiness certificate issue by Italy , in Sicily , with the last inspection carry out in Bulgaria , I think . </s>
the ship be sink and the captain realise that it be sink and that it be not even go to make it to the next port . </s>
this kind of situation should not be allow . </s>
the damage to your country , Mr President , and to mine , Spain , could be horrendous . </s>
Mr Medina Ortega , I naturally share your concern and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own , the country currently hold the presidency , be naturally very concern about this issue , all the more so as it do not have any oil tanker of its own . </s>
however , we have to work within the existing legislative framework . </s>
that legislative framework be the @card@ directive , which have a set of regulation with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implement more rigorously . </s>
in this area we have to work with the world as it be , and that mean react in accordance with the fact of the situation . </s>
in view of the seriousness of such situation , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authority have at least react and undertake to examine the legislative provision already exist in this field . </s>
the Commission 's intention in this area be positive , as it intend to reinforce the application of the @card@ directive . </s>
the Council be mind to give priority to this area , within the Transport Council , and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible . </s>
we also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it come before this House under the codecision procedure . </s>
Mr President , in Kotka , in Finland , there be currently a vessel carry chemical , which be sail under a flag of convenience . </s>
the vessel be anchor outside the port , as the condition it be in be a safety hazard for the port and the surround area , and because it can be inspect properly , as there be no one who will pay . </s>
Would it be possible for the Eu to create a standardise inspection system that would also guarantee payment , out of Community fund , for the inspection of ship that fly a flag of convenience and can themselves pay the cost ? </s>
- ( PT ) Mrs Korhola , as you will understand , I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply . </s>
the information that I have be to do with the @card@ directive , which do not include any provision of that kind . </s>
however , the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the option available for act in the case you have mention . </s>
question no 2 by ( H-0024 / @card@ ) : subject : high infant mortality level in Kosovo accord to the most recent UN information forward to the World Health Organisation , Kosovo have the high rate of infant mortality in Europe . </s>
about @card@ % of premature baby do not survive and the war have result in a massive increase in the number of miscarriage . </s>
even baby bear when due tend to be underdeveloped . </s>
in view of the humanitarian aid be give by the European Union and the effort be make by the head of the interim administration , Mr Bernard Kouchner , what measure will the Council take to defend the right of the woman of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant woman , woman in confinement and new-born child ? </s>
Mr President , Mrs Karamanou 's question be an extremely serious one , and I would not wish to conceal that fact . </s>
we be perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displace people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rate . </s>
I think it be well know that the European Union have make a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort be make by the international community . </s>
as you know , the European Community have contribute a total of EUR @card@ million for the province of Kosovo alone , and this have to be see in conjunction with the contribution make by Member States at national level . </s>
this contribution cover various project in the field of health and health system and of water purification . </s>
furthermore , as you know , the European Union make a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees , which come to EUR @card@ million in @card@ . </s>
I think that Mrs Karamanou be aware that , because of the need for division of labour between the international donor , the task of restore health care in Kosovo have be entrust to the World Health Organisation . </s>
the report produce by the who indicate that it be fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation , and it have focus its effort on improve basic condition in maternity and general hospital . </s>
nevertheless , we be aware that this situation be far from a satisfactory solution and that there be widespread repercussion in other area of health care , apart from child health . </s>
this be not just a technical situation , it be a political situation , and it go hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation , because there be aspect to this , and we may as well be open about this , which be associate with the international community 's inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo , with tragic effect on attempt to improve health care in that region . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I thank you for your answer which supplement what Commissioner Patten say yesterday on the subject . </s>
yet , the sum of EUR @card@ million you mention have be give in @card@ , be prove by the fact to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised condition in Kosovo , especially where the provision of health service be concern . </s>
Mr President-in-Office , do you not think that the very fact of increase child mortality be an abomination for the continent of Europe , a shameful thing , which should motivate us all , so that the aid we provide become more effective and more generous ? </s>
of course , the situation be not idyllic , even before the bombardment , anything but , I should say . </s>
however , since NATO 's intervention , there have be a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment . </s>
so , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , be it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised condition for the long-suffering inhabitant of Kosovo , and above all , keep our promise to them ? </s>
Mrs Karamanou , I recognise the fact that all the effort that have be make in Kosovo in this field have not be enough . </s>
I do not think that any of us have the least doubt about that . </s>
I do not want to link this question with your comment about the period &quot; before &quot; and &quot; after &quot; NATO 's intervention , as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to say that the European Union be aware that the resource it have devote to Kosovo reflect the financial limitation it have to work within . </s>
we have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community . </s>
the European Union have a certain responsibility in view of that particular role , but we can undertake to rapidly rebuild structure that be , as you have say yourself , Mrs Karamanou , not the good before the military action in Kosovo . </s>
What be more , I do not believe , Mrs Karamanou , that the military action in Kosovo result in such a significant destruction of public health facility as to have have a direct impact on the current situation . </s>
the present position be more dramatic in term of displace population , and in term of a whole raft of economic factor and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facility result from the overall breakdown in organisational structure in Kosovo 's administration . </s>
this be the basic issue underlie the present situation as a whole . </s>
and if we can solve the political problem , which must be do in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution , then we will not solve the problem of child health , nor the various other problem face by this region . </s>
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica . </s>
in cooperation with Europe , the international community rebuild the hospital there too , but it be locate in the northern part of the city , thus prohibit access to Albanian Kosovars . </s>
this mean that medical aid be still deny to the Albanian Kosovars . </s>
this be also happen elsewhere in the country , cause tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs , make for a situation where nobody trust anybody anymore and where Albanian do not want to be look after by Serbs and vice versa . </s>
I understand very well what you be say and you be right : the European Union should work in a wide context of international cooperation . </s>
but where will you place the emphasis ? </s>
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be care for in a hospital , include that in Mitrovica ? </s>
Mr Staes , the situation in Mitrovica be well know . </s>
this be a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately be not match with such severity in other part of Kosovo . </s>
I perfectly understand Mr Staes 's concern . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner 's work in this area have aim to comply with the objective of the relevant United Nations resolution , in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facility which can serve the various community , include the various aspect of the administration . </s>
I believe that we should not jump to conclusion here about who be responsible , because there be various protagonist involve . </s>
the situation in Mitrovica be appalling , and involve very special tension , and I believe that the measure take over the last few hour to create safe condition in that area be to be welcome . </s>
nevertheless , I have to say that , regrettably , we do not have the police resource - and this be connect with the Member States ' contribution - to guarantee the follow-up action we propose to the military action , that be to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanism guarantee adequate safety for the various community , and , in particular , access to hospital . </s>
question no 3 by ( H-0027 / @card@ ) : subject : indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human right organisation , such as the US Human Rights Watch , have already collect significant evidence of NATO crime in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bring a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague . </s>
on the basis of this evidence , some of which have already be lodge with the Tribunal , NATO be accuse of ' serious violation of international humanitarian law ' and ' wilful murder ' . </s>
do the Council consider that such accusation should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation ? </s>
in the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusation against NATO , what will be do in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP , who be NATO Secretary-General during the crisis ? </s>
be there any procedure for suspend him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusation have be complete ? </s>
Mr President , Mr Alavanos ' question naturally give us food for thought on a wide range of issue . </s>
the Council have already , on various occasion , state its conviction that the severe measure take by NATO be both necessary and justify to deal with extremist and irresponsible action involve clear violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution . </s>
I be aware that there may be different view about NATO 's action and the legitimacy of that action . </s>
Everyone be free to hold such view . </s>
in my own country , the various parliamentary group have differ view on this matter . </s>
that be how it be . </s>
in any case , the Council 's position be clear in that it consider that the objective of the air campaign carry out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo cause by the Belgrade regime . </s>
this objective be fully and formally express in the statement adopt by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April . </s>
I must say that these NATO measure be not take lightly and be only carry out as a last resort when it become evident that all avenue for reach a negotiate solution have be exhaust and that the Belgrade authority be concentrate their force in order to expel the Kosovo Albanian from their land . </s>
I be sure you be aware , Mr Alavanos , that , during her recent visit to NATO headquarters , Prosecutor Del Ponte stress that the International Tribunal be oblige to examine all accusation present to it , include those make against NATO , in particular by pacifist group from Canada . </s>
this compulsory examination be to be carry out in line with accusation submit . </s>
in any case , I have with me a statement make by Prosecutor Del Ponte accord to which NATO be not at present under any investigation by the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there be no formal inquiry process concern NATO 's action in the Kosovo conflict . </s>
all information receive during the past six month , either from individual or from group request an investigation of NATO 's action during the Kosovo conflict , have be record by the prosecutor . </s>
any other information will of course be analyse by the Prosecutor , who will in due course decide whether or not there be cause for action . </s>
until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte have decide not to examine any of the accusation of criminality make against NATO . </s>
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO 's intervention be to stop a humanitarian disaster , because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today , we have the hell of Milosevic , follow by the hell of the KLA and the NATO force . </s>
if the President-in-Office have notice , almost half the question he have have to answer today relate to Kosovo . </s>
despite this , he too accept that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after application by Canadian and other pacifist organisation be an open question . </s>
my question , which the President-in-Office do not answer , be this : if this inquisition procedure begin , in which the main or , if you will , one of the main people interrogate and probably find guilty will be Mr Solana , who be today the High Representative of the European Union 's Common Foreign and Security Policy , should it not be , if that happen , if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal be determine to begin the process , that Mr Solana 's status be suspend at least until it be show that his hand be clean ? </s>
Mr Alavanos , if an action of this kind should be bring against NATO and if this action be to be bring against Mr Javier Solana personally , we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana hold one post at that time and be hold a different one today . </s>
the duty that he exercise today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duty that he exercise during his time as Secretary-General of NATO . </s>
in the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there be no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter . </s>
Mr President , I believe Mr Alavanos be get NATO and Mr Milosevic mix up . </s>
Mr Milosevic should be appear before the war crime tribunal and we should be award NATO the Sakharov prise . </s>
but I have a quite different question for the Council . </s>
How do matter stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration , the judiciary and , most importantly of all , the police force ? </s>
you mention before that we be on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing be be do . </s>
rapid action be call for ! </s>
first of all , I would like to say that I agree with the priority you have identify concern personal responsibility , Mr Posselt . </s>
with regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo , we have already hear Mr Kouchner , on various occasion , describe the enormous difficulty he be experience in set up administrative machinery and a judicial structure . </s>
as you know , the first step be take some month ago . </s>
we be all aware of the difficulty , and particularly the financial difficulty , that Mr Kouchner be face in set up this administrative machinery , and , in particular , we be aware of the special difficulty involve in recruit police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety . </s>
this be a responsibility that the European Union take very seriously , Mr Posselt , and I would like to mention that , at the General Affairs Council hold on Monday , this issue be repeatedly stress when we be discuss Kosovo . </s>
statement be make and pressure be bring to bear on the various Member States who have undertake to make police resource available to honour their commitment . </s>
some Member States be take refuge in the fact that they have provide military force and that they can send the police force , to which they commit themselves , as quickly as they would like . </s>
we be certainly very much aware that this factor be seriously compromise Mr Kouchner 's work and the normalisation of administrative structure in Kosovo , especially as regard judicial structure and police cover . </s>
this be have unfortunate and obvious effect on the scope for control inter-ethnic coordination , and we be all conscious that , if measure be not take in the short term , we may end up with situation involve the kind of tension that we witness just a few hour ago , and that these tension may be mirror in other area of Kosovo . </s>
this be obviously a question which really have to be see in a NATO context , but , as the European Union share NATO 's view of these issue , it be not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this . </s>
I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council , so that there can be no doubt . </s>
Mr Marset Campos , you will be aware , first of all , of how difficult it be to select target during a military operation , particularly an air-based one , and you will also be aware that there be a category of target that , whilst they be not military target as such , be infrastructure target select with a view to hinder the smooth running of the military machine . </s>
we be of course enter a grey area here , and you may say , Mr Marset Campos , that these be civilian target , such as bridge and road and rail infrastructure , whilst other will tell me that they be military target , because they be target which support military structure in aggressive campaign such as those carry out by Mr Milosevic 's force in Kosovo . </s>
so we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain target . </s>
unfortunately , and as everyone recognise during the military action in Kosovo , there be civilian sector , and in particular infrastructural sector directly affect the general public , and even inhabit area , which be directly affect by NATO air attack . </s>
this be generally recognise and this happen in all war , and the Kosovo war be not a clean war , nor a model war , but a war base on the art of the possible . </s>
and , above all , it be a necessary war , and it be not only about what be possible , it be necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which be utterly reject by the entire international community . </s>
Mr Marset Campos , regardless of how we may see thing with hindsight - and it be easy to see thing with the benefit of hindsight , if you take no action yourself - I believe that , if we look at what happen in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina lead to , and the continuation of that impunity , then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light . </s>
question no 4 by ( H-0028 / @card@ ) : subject : Turkish blockade of Armenia give that the European Union be actively promote social , economic and political relation with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , sign on @card@ October @card@ , what step be the Council take to persuade the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ? </s>
have the time come for the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , Mrs Schleicher 's question be about a regional conflict , and at first sight , the question appear to assume that our relation with Turkey and Armenia be merely bilateral . </s>
it be obvious that underlie this question be the key issue of Nagorno-Karabakh and also Armenia 's conflict with Azerbaijan , which have repercussion here of course , give the special relationship that Azerbaijan have with Turkey . </s>
nevertheless , as regard the relationship that interest us - the relationship between the European Union and Armenia - the entry into force of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in July @card@ and the first meeting that we hold in October last year show how seriously the European Union take its relation with Armenia . </s>
One of our aim be to extend commercial relation in the area of trade and investment in particular . </s>
another aim be to maintain a bilateral political dialogue with Armenia , in view of its major role in that subregion . </s>
as I say , Nagorno-Karabakh be an issue which it be still vital to resolve and one which of course threaten the stability of the southern Caucasus . </s>
in our view , all effort to achieve a solution to this conflict must be intensify . </s>
this must be our top priority . </s>
the European Union have be endeavour to facilitate this process and we be of course also aware that Turkey must adopt a constructive attitude towards this matter and play a major role in it . </s>
in December @card@ , as we all know , Turkey be accept as a candidate for membership of the European Union . </s>
political dialogue with Turkey will be step up in view of this new situation . </s>
the presidency of the European Union , which I myself represent , visit Ankara immediately after that decision and we stress to the Turkish authority the importance of strengthen political dialogue between us . </s>
in particular , we stress the need for us to take advantage of Turkey 's own importance in the region , particularly in relation to central Asia and the Caucasus . </s>
we will try to reach common position on international issue in the context of this relationship with Turkey , one which we would like to see become ever closer politically speak . </s>
as I have say , this apply in particular in view of the region of which Turkey form a part , and give the importance of its strategic geographical position . </s>
we hope that Turkey will adopt a constructive and positive attitude . </s>
above all , we hope that , in the political dialogue precede the whole run-up to negotiation , Turkey will be able to accept the European Union 's statement on common foreign and security policy . </s>
in this case , I feel that Turkey will not be able to avoid our interpretation of the need to find reasonable solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh situation , respect the legitimate aspect of both Armenia and Azerbaijan 's position . </s>
Mr President , I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer . </s>
nevertheless , I be a little disappoint that this be view from a bilateral angle first and foremost when , ultimately , there be in fact a major tripartite relationship . </s>
we provide partnership funding and there be cooperation agreement in place , in order to help Armenia , and still the aid can come into play because Turkey have impose an economic blockade , and so many thing can get through to the Armenians at all . </s>
we be negotiate with Turkey as to the possibility of its accede to the Union and so it be in the interest of all of us that every state that wish to become a Member should cultivate friendly relation with its neighbour . </s>
Can you not exert great influence over Turkey , so as to enable there to be peaceful development in this region , and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front ? </s>
- ( PT ) Mrs Schleicher , you be quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and , particularly , that it become part of the solution rather than part of the problem . </s>
we feel that precisely because Turkey have embark on a new type of relationship with the European Union , and also because Turkey now have to respond to the European Union 's position on common foreign and security policy issue , we will , to be frank , be test Turkey 's will as regard the European Union 's priority in its foreign relation . </s>
our relationship with Armenia , as evince by the agreement we sign with that country last year , be of course one element in these foreign relation . </s>
we also feel that , if Turkey wish to move towards share the fundamental value of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union 's relation , regardless of whatever special bilateral condition may apply to its own relation with any other country , it must in general act in accordance with the basic standard demonstrate by the European union in its foreign relation . </s>
we be , moreover , convince that this issue will be one of the priority of the bilateral relation between the European Union and Turkey in the near future . </s>
as they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 5 and 6 will be take together . </s>
question no 5 by ( H-0031 / @card@ ) : subject : worsen situation in Kosovo in Kosovo , the genocide of Serbs and other non-Albanian ethnic group be continue and worsen to the extent that Mr Bernard Kouchner himself recently announce that the political situation and the level of security in the area be far from satisfactory . </s>
accusation be also be make of failure to implement UN Directive @card@ since , on the one hand , its provision concern guarantee for all the inhabitant of Kosovo be be disregard and on the other , encouragement be be give to extremist breakaway group , culminate in the appointment of the former KLA leader H. Thaci as ' interim prime minister ' of Kosovo and the designation of the KLA as the ' Kosovo protection force ' . </s>
What step will the Council take in view of the above in order to ensure compliance with UN decision and , in particular , resolution @card@ and prevent the secession of the province of Kosovo from Serbia ? </s>
question no 6 by ( H-0122 / @card@ ) : subject : ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the Eu aim at prevent the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanian by Serbia , and since the arrival of KFOR on @card@ June @card@ , @card@ @card@ Serbs living in Kosovo have be expel and @card@ murder , constitute ethnic cleansing on a large scale than that carry out by the Serbs themselves . </s>
during the last few day we have see Serbs murder by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type group , also with impunity . </s>
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end , once and for all , to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human right of the whole population of Kosovo , irrespective of race or creed ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) Mr President , as I state in response to a previous question , the situation in Kosovo be an issue to which last Monday 's General Affairs Council certainly pay a great deal of attention . </s>
that Council emphasise its support for the effort of UNMIK and of Bernard Kouchner , the special representative of the Secretary-General , and in particular their effort to create an interim administrative structure , in Kosovo , under which the guarantee that it will include all side , particularly those which have until now refuse to take part in this interim structure , will not be an empty one . </s>
Javier Solana , the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy of the European Union , give this General Affairs Council an assessment of the situation . </s>
he be expect to put forward proposal on this matter , particularly internal adjustment measure , which will allow , not only a certain degree of flexibility in inter-ethnic relation , but will also - as I have already state in response to another question - permit the establishment of new police structure and the creation of system which will enable the Kosovo situation to be prevent from become considerably bad , in term of corruption , drug-trafficking and crime . </s>
the force on the ground have so far be unable to solve these problem . </s>
it be therefore obvious , Mr Korakas , that the Council of Ministers be still seriously concern about the current situation in Kosovo , particularly about the exodus of the Serbian population and of other ethnic and religious minority from Kosovo . </s>
these minority be often not mention enough when discrimination take place in Kosovo be discuss . </s>
the Council wish to express its consternation and concern at the degree of inter-ethnic violence still be see . </s>
as I have already say in response to another question , the late outbreak of hostility in Mitrovica be just another example of the difficulty of overcome the distrust which have build up over decade . </s>
obviously we be at just one stage of a process which have already pass through various early stage , and I think that we should always see this stage in the light of history . </s>
the Council of Ministers of the European Union have on several occasion state its commitment to establish a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo in accordance with the term of United Nations Security Council Resolution @card@ . </s>
it have in particular declare its commitment to all refugee be able to return safely and without obstacle . </s>
I would like to make it clear , Mr Korakas , regardless of the many doubt that we may have concern Resolution @card@ , that it be still the main determinant of our action in that region . </s>
as regard criticism level at the Council , I wish to state that the Council condemn all act of violence , persecution and intolerance , whoever commit them . </s>
therefore , in response to the current situation , the Council have resolutely support the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo , UNMIK , have contribute to its budget and have take responsibility for the so-called &quot; fourth UNMIK pillar &quot; , which be concern with economic reconstruction and rehabilitation . </s>
in assess the progress that UNMIK have make so far , we must bear in mind the extremely difficult circumstance in which this organisation be operate . </s>
by this I mean the large number of refugee and displace person who have have to be rehouse , the fact that most of the infrastructure have be destroy , the strength of feeling that still exist in every section of Kosovo 's population , the fact that the economy have collapse and the total lack of internal tax income . </s>
There be also the fact that administrative structure at local and district level have implode , as have the judicial and police system . </s>
this be all due to the war and to a decade of neglect after Belgrade remove Kosovo 's autonomy . </s>
this factor be important and it should remain clear in everyone 's mind that it be the change in Kosovo 's status within the Republic of Yugoslavia that cause the increase ethnic tension that give rise to the current situation . </s>
this factor must not be forget , lest the past action of those who be historically responsible should also be forget . </s>
in these circumstance , I think that UNMIK , together with the other international body and organisation involve , must have make some progress in relation to some of the objective state in Resolution @card@ , although we be still a long way from a situation which be at all satisfactory . </s>
the Council also support the decision of the special representative , Bernard Kouchner , to establish a provisional joint administrative council which should include all of Kosovo 's ethnic group , as I have already mention . </s>
the European Union have appeal to the Serbs in Kosovo to reconsider their boycott of this structure so that they can contribute to a multi-ethnic region and assure themselves a place in the new administrative structure . </s>
on the other hand , the European Union be also support UNMIK 's effort to construct the Kosovar civil police force , with the aim of help to combat multi-ethnic violence and of create the secure atmosphere necessary to prevent Kosovars of non-Albanian ethnic origin from leave the province . </s>
although we have already make a substantial contribution , we must recognise that , until now , as I have already say , the Eu Member States have not be able to detach officer to this police force , which have prove to be a very damaging factor for the operation of a public security structure . </s>
as I have say , in accordance with the conclusion of the General Affairs Council of @card@ January , the Member States be do their utmost to find additional police personnel , and the most recent General Affairs Council reiterate this position . </s>
strengthen police force be also an important task in the context of the grow threat represent by organise crime , and the Commission be seek to include the fight against organise crime in its programme of assistance for Kosovo for @card@ and be ask the Member States to identify what assistance they can provide in this area . </s>
we feel that a large part of the solution to the Kosovo problem - and there can be very much doubt about this - also relate to the problem of stabilise the country involve . </s>
unless this be do , there be no point in think that we can solve Kosovo 's problem . </s>
we therefore need to stabilise the situation in Albania , and there be currently proposal for the Commission to evaluate Albania 's chance of move towards a stabilisation and association agreement . </s>
we need to stabilise the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , and we need to come up with integrated model in the other area of the former Yugoslavia . </s>
unless we can do all this , we will not be able to find separate solution for Kosovo . </s>
it be the overall context in the region and the overall context for implement the Stability Pact that provide a solution for this situation . </s>
Mr President , I be sorry , but , listen to the Council 's representative , one really have to wonder how far hypocrisy , tolerance and complicity can go . </s>
it be a fact that , as they say in my country , in the home of a hang man one do not mention rope . </s>
Yugoslavia use to be a peaceful country , a paragon of stability and peace . </s>
it be NATO 's intervention and initially those of Germany which lead to all that have happen . </s>
so it be not the Belgrade government that be responsible , but NATO itself , the imperialist and their intervention . </s>
What do we have today ? </s>
we have a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution @card@ and this prove that it be a trap . </s>
we have @card@ @card@ Serbians , Gypsy and other nationality , besides Albanian Kosovars , who have be expel . </s>
Nine-hundred be murder , @card@ abduct , and 8 month later we have a continuing and flagrant violation of the Security Council 's resolution . </s>
for example , not only have the KLA fail to disarm , as provide for in the resolution , but on the contrary , by virtue of Mr Kouchner 's assertion in the European Parliament , it have acquire modern equipment and have now be designate the &quot; Kosovo Protection Force &quot; . </s>
in conclusion , since the Minister mention Mr Kouchner , I would like to say that , with his @card@ decree , Kouchner be violate both the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and the Security Council 's resolution . </s>
he have create a separate currency , a judicial body ... ( the President interrupt the speaker ) let us see thing as they be , Mr President ! </s>
- ( PT ) I do not think that be a question , Mr Korakas , those be statement . </s>
the first of these which I wish to draw to the House 's attention be the idea that Belgrade be not responsible for the situation in Kosovo . </s>
I wish to make this clear because it be an important statement and it imply that imperialist action by NATO be responsible for the situation in Kosovo . </s>
this be an odd interpretation - although it be perhaps not quite so odd , as it be share by the Serbian authority - but I think that you must understand , Mr Korakas , that there be other interpretation too . </s>
you must also understand that the international community and the Eu Council of Ministers have a view of event which be very different to your own . </s>
with regard to Resolution @card@ , if it be a trap , then I do not understand either why it be that you think that every violation of this trap be consider to be damaging . </s>
Resolution @card@ may not be perfect , but it be the only resolution that could be agree upon to bring an end to a particular situation . </s>
this resolution have probably be difficult to apply for the simple reason that it presuppose a climate of stability , to which neither Mr Milosevic nor his regime have contribute . </s>
I recognise , as we all do , that the behaviour of certain Kosovar Albanian force in Kosovo have be neither desirable nor successful . </s>
Mr Kouchner have be highly critical of this situation and this behaviour . </s>
we should not imagine , Mr Korakas , that all the blame can be place on one side . </s>
nor should we imagine that we can forget the past when we be analyse the present . </s>
the present , particularly in the case of the Balkans , and you know this good than I do , have its root in history and in successive historical development . </s>
There be not only &quot; good guy &quot; in this story . </s>
as I see it , these situation be quite clear and we should all learn lesson from and accept responsibility for our previous inaction in the face of Mr Milosevic 's behaviour , at a time when he could do whatever he want in Kosovo with impunity , particularly once he have take away its autonomy . </s>
I thank the Minister for his response , but I would also like to point out that , statistically , there be now more violence in Kosovo than there be before the NATO bombing . </s>
it be worry that the bombing have aggravate the situation , and we should recognise that it be a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action . </s>
I agree with what the Minister very rightly say about the culpability of Belgrade , but we should also remember that the secret service of the USA , Germany , France , Italy and the United Kingdom have be supply arm and money to the KLA , a mafia , which have contribute to the problem in the area . </s>
we be therefore all to blame . </s>
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wide context . </s>
do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia ? </s>
- ( PT ) I would like to say , Mr Marset Campos , that I find it very difficult to make judgment base on supposition about what might have happen if something else have not happen ! </s>
neither you nor I will ever know what might be happen now in Kosovo or what might have happen in Kosovo if NATO have not drop its bomb . </s>
we will never know if the aggressive and ever worsen action Mr Milosevic and his government be perpetrate more and more frequently would in fact have have far more dire consequence than those that we be witness in Kosovo today . </s>
with regard to lifting sanction , we think that the European Union 's attitude towards Yugoslavia have amount to a careful assessment of the various situation . </s>
we have implement an Energy for Democracy programme to support democratically govern municipality in Yugoslavia . </s>
we react positively , at last Monday 's General Affairs Council , to the request make to us by democratic force in Serbia that we should lift the air embargo , both for international aircraft and for aircraft belong to Yugoslavia 's national airline . </s>
these be sign of the European Union 's goodwill towards the situation in Serbia . </s>
we must realise that we will not achieve result by make gesture that be not reciprocate . </s>
nor will we achieve result by provide certain kind of facility for the Serbian authority , whose action , particularly in the sphere of human right within Serbia , and particularly as regard Serbia 's internal political system , be still deeply regrettable . </s>
I hope that you will agree with me , Mr Marset Campos , about the current state of democracy in that country . </s>
we shall make appropriate gesture towards Serbia , in term of provide service , of lift sanction , when Serbia 's behaviour , both on the international stage and in its relation with its neighbour country , and its behaviour within its own border , be in tune with what we consider to be the fundamental principle govern the international community and the behaviour of &quot; decent &quot; country on the world stage . </s>
Mr President , I be no friend of Milosevic or his government . </s>
nevertheless I have the grave doubt about the legitimacy of Nato 's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo , both in term of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have be avoid by not impose unacceptable term on Serbia 's sovereignty at Rambouillet . </s>
the current situation in Kosovo , which be now ethnically cleanse of Serbs and Roma , speak for itself . </s>
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate target of the Belgrade TV tower and kill over @card@ civilian journalist , which remain a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now open the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crime against our Western leader ? </s>
Mr Tannock , with regard to the position adopt by the European Union , we do not have selective interpretation and analysis of what be military objective , and in particular of the initiative take against certain type of infrastructure that be prop up Mr Milosevic 's political system and act as propaganda for him . </s>
I can therefore tell you whether we agree or not on a specific action carry out by NATO , but it be part of an overall plan with which we do agree . </s>
some of these action might have be questionable , and some be regard as unfortunate by NATO itself , but other be justify for tactical reason , with the aim of prevent Mr Milosevic from continue his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia . </s>
in any event , I , on behalf of the Council , do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carry out by NATO . </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , since I know the history of the Balkans , I should like to remind you that , for many decade , the people of Yugoslavia live in peace . </s>
Destabilisation begin around ten year ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia , in which the European Union play a decisive part . </s>
Yugoslavia 's crime be that it be the only Balkan country that do not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union . </s>
so whatever remain standing after the air attack be now be destroy by the supposedly disarm KLA , under the very nose of KFOR , whose role as an occupying force be become increasingly apparent . </s>
every day , new crime come to light against non-Albanian speaker and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo , and there be hundred of violation of the UN 's Resolution @card@ . </s>
in my opinion , the good thing the Council could do would be to cease occupy that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all side , with respect for the various national characteristic in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affair of another , independent country . </s>
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region , Mr Alyssandrakis , but I find it difficult , quite frankly , to understand how respect the characteristic of the region can , in term of political stability , be a solution to the problem . </s>
if we look at the democratic stability of the region , it could perhaps be say that it be the break-up of Yugoslavia that cause the current situation , but let us not get involve in interpret an international development . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to say that Yugoslavia be what it be , in the sense that the state manage to harmonise some of its people 's ethnic difference to a degree . </s>
it must be point out that it do this at a time when its political framework be far from ideal in term of be democratically representative . </s>
the division of Yugoslavia be probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept , regardless of the mistake that may have be make along the way . </s>
we do not feel that withdraw international force now would be any kind of solution . </s>
Quite the contrary , it would be a solution lead to calamity . </s>
Mr President , I be a little disappoint with the answer give by the President-in-Office to my colleague . </s>
it be very important , if we stress that Europe be to be a Europe of value , that we do not go down the road of say that mean justify end . </s>
if civilian target be target and destroy , kill civilian be illegal by anyone 's standard . </s>
it should not be defend even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime . </s>
that , however , be not my question . </s>
my question be about political prisoner hold in Serbia now . </s>
There be , I believe , around 5 @card@ Kosovar political prisoner hold in Serbia at the moment . </s>
my question to the President-in-Office be twofold . </s>
firstly , be the council fully aware of and concern about the fate of these prisoner ? </s>
secondly , what do it propose to do about them ? </s>
Mr MacCormick , first of all , I would like to answer your comment . </s>
I do not defend attack on civilian . </s>
What I say and what I explain in a previous answer be that there be civilian target link with structure which be object for military action , and you know as well as I do that some military action not only go for military target , but also for civilian target and structure which be connect with military action . </s>
What be a legitimate target be obviously a grey area . </s>
as I say , we be not make value judgement about specific action . </s>
we be make an overall value judgement about NATO 's action , and this overall value judgement be positive . </s>
we agree with the general view of NATO 's action . </s>
with regard to political prisoner in Serbia , Mr MacCormick , it be obvious that , when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic be not act in accordance with the rule of a decent society at international level , I be refer specifically , not just to the way he act towards his fellow citizen . </s>
I be also refer to the way Mr Milosevic treat political prisoner , and the way he attack democratic right and the opposition 's right of access to the medium , and to his attack on the facility that should be grant to non-governmental organisation , particularly those protect human right . </s>
in spite of everything , all this represent only one of many kind of highly pernicious action perpetrate by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society , and the European Union be of course inevitably concern about this situation . </s>
this be precisely why the European Union be maintain all its sanction until Yugoslavia 's behaviour on the international stage reflect the value that we have to defend . </s>
question no 7 by ( H-0035 / @card@ ) : subject : draft of the Charter of Fundamental Rights the general public welcome the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights be to be draw up . </s>
it be also to be hope that it will meet the challenge of Europe in the 21st century . </s>
What be the Council 's view on the substance of the Charter ? </s>
What type of right will the Charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ? </s>
which citizen will it cover ( those of the European Union or the citizen of all European country with a view to enlargement ? </s>
Will it cover immigrant etc . </s>
? </s>
) ? </s>
Will it set out established social right in the European Union or will it set a broad agenda ? </s>
What mean will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantee equality between the sex ? </s>
What be the Council 's view on incorporate the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ? </s>
the Charter of Fundamental Rights be one of the most promising aspect of any that we in the European Union be work on at institutional level . </s>
as you know , the charter stem from a decision of the Cologne European Council . </s>
it be a factor that we feel be crucial to the construction of what could be call an ethical pillar for the European Union and of what could be call the European Union 's need , in aim to achieve a union of value , to be able to increase its scope , not just internally , but also in order to give legitimacy to its own image externally , base on a common set of value . </s>
this be of course extremely important for the Community of Fifteen . </s>
Four or five month ago , we probably do not think this be so important for the Community of Fifteen . </s>
today , we be perhaps already think along different line , or at least some of us be . </s>
the enlarged union be also very important , specifically with regard to future cultural policy . </s>
the content of the charter be , as you know , currently under discussion . </s>
There have only be two meeting of the preparatory group for the Charter of Fundamental Rights ; this group be now call the convention for the Eu Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
There be various problem that must be address in this area . </s>
first of all , we must decide if it be a declaratory text or a binding text . </s>
secondly , there be the content of the charter . </s>
this apply whether the document be binding or not . </s>
in other word , we must decide whether it be a collection of all the principle which the Member States advocate and have enshrine in their national constitution , or whether it be a new corpus which could to a certain extent act as a common pattern for the European Union . </s>
then there be a fundamental problem which your question in fact touch upon and which I think be of the utmost importance , yet it have still not be resolve . </s>
that issue be whether this charter only apply to citizen of the Union or whether it also apply to third-country national who be resident in the Union . </s>
this issue be also under discussion . </s>
There be also an extremely important issue , that of the subordination of legal system , and compatibility between the legal system of the Strasbourg Court and the legal system of the Luxembourg Court . </s>
this problem must be resolve when the Charter of Fundamental Rights be draw up . </s>
you also touch upon the issue of social right , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou . </s>
we will have to find some common ground on this matter . </s>
I would like to say , as a member of the Portuguese delegation , that we regard economic and social right as a vital part of the European Union 's heritage , and understand that they must be part of any European Union charter and of any corpus of European Union value . </s>
I do not know whether everyone share this view . </s>
concern your last question , there be the issue of equality between man and woman in the European Union . </s>
I be sure that this aspect will certainly be treat with the utmost care in this charter , all the more so because , during discussion on the Treaty of Amsterdam , we ourselves have strong view on this and the provision of the Treaty of Amsterdam represent a qualitative leap as compare with Maastricht . </s>
lastly , on the subject of incorporate the charter into the Treaty on European Union , I be currently chair the steer group of the preparatory group for the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency be keen to ensure that , as soon as there be consensus on the charter among the people draft it , it should be incorporate into the Treaty on European Union and that this issue should immediately be refer to the Intergovernmental Conference . </s>
as you know , the charter do not fall within the competence of the Council , but come under a convention with an elect chairman and representative of the European Parliament , of national parliament and of the government of the Member States , and of the European Commission . </s>
it should be refer to the Intergovernmental Conference as soon as it be ready , but we be not in control of this procedure . </s>
we be merely monitor the progress of the charter by mean of a vice-chairman of the convention , who be at the same time the representative of the European Union presidency in this group . </s>
I thank the President-in-Office for the concern and certainty he have express about the progress of the work . </s>
you will understand , Mr President-in-Office , that there be a point to my question , because the Council be a political body of the European Union and the citizen of Europe , man and woman , want to know how it view the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century . </s>
as a supplementary question , I should like to ask you whether , as the Portuguese Presidency , you have make provision for the right of child , as such , to be include in future deliberation and the right to be incorporate in the Charter . </s>
as I say , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , we be not in control of the procedure for draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
this procedure fall within the competence of the member of the group , and the matter will only be submit to the council if and when consensus be reach on the term of this charter . </s>
I would nevertheless like to say , with regard to the right of the child , that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue , particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international text to which we have sign up . </s>
this matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
this will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
furthermore , we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposal that we have on this issue . </s>
I do not know whether these proposal will meet with a favourable reception or not . </s>
I presume , however , that this be not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bring together the currently agree corpus of right , which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be include in the charter and be share by the Union as a whole . </s>
I would remind member that , accord to the guideline for these sitting , question must be concise and be word in a way which will allow a brief answer . </s>
you know that there be a parliamentary delegation chair by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issue can be debate at great length . </s>
I therefore ask that both question and answer be very brief . </s>
otherwise , we would be in a way undermine the whole process of draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
I be sure that the President-in-Office of the Council be prepare to answer everything , but I must ensure that this sit consist of question and answer . </s>
Mr Rübig have the floor . </s>
Mr President , fourteen Member States have impose bilateral sanction on another Member State , because a democratically elect government be form there . </s>
both party be once part of the government . </s>
so far there have be no infringement of the law . </s>
be preventive sanction reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights ? </s>
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council , in respect of the formation of national government , be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ? </s>
be the call for violent demonstration reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ? </s>
Mr Rübig , as President-in-Office , I can give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union be adopt bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union . </s>
nevertheless , I would like to say that the various preventive action take on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States be actually a set of action of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level . </s>
we feel that they be perfectly justify and seem to be reasonable in the face of the action and personality of a party which , although it have become part of a European Union government , do not strike us as be able to guarantee that it can meet the Union 's aim . </s>
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency , because my government intervene at the request of , and in conjunction with , fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity . </s>
Mr President , I have the honour of be a member of the convention draft the Charter so I be not go to ask the presidency to speculate on the content or whether it think the convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force . </s>
What I would like to know be what will happen to the draft Charter that the convention draw up ? </s>
Will the Council treat it as a document that it have to accept as it stand , or will the Council feel free to amend that document ? </s>
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter ? </s>
- ( PT ) the answer be neither yes nor no . </s>
I do not know , Mr Martin . </s>
it will depend on the decision take by the Council . </s>
question no 8 by ( H-0042 / @card@ ) : subject : grant of export credit guarantee and its implication for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey the G8 meeting in Cologne call on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standard for the grant of export credit . </s>
these can be use to distort competition and support questionable project . </s>
Will the Eu take the lead in advance this process ? </s>
the need be demonstrate recently by the statement from the British government that it be ' mind to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involve in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey . </s>
the World Bank have decide not to fund the project , which will displace @card@ @card@ Kurd , potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage . </s>
What be the Council 's view of the involvement of European government and company in this project ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) To answer your question , Mrs Lucas , we must consider this issue from two angle . </s>
firstly , concern the system of export credit in general , and , secondly , concern the project you have mention in particular . </s>
with regard to the general point , it should be point out that the G8 do not call on the OECD to establish common standard for the grant of export credit , as your question suggest . </s>
these standard already exist today . </s>
the agreement on guideline for export credit which enjoy official support have be in force within the OECD since @card@ . </s>
the objective of these guideline be precisely to see that officially back export credit be use properly , that be in a transparent and disciplined way . </s>
as you know , most OECD country be already party to this agreement and the European community as such , and not the Member States individually , be also party to this agreement , in accordance with Article @card@ , formerly Article @card@ of the Treaty on European Union . </s>
this agreement have be gradually correct and improve and the European Union wish to maintain its pivotal role in this process because it consider this to be of central importance in its international economic relation . </s>
with regard to the G8 , and in accordance with paragraph @card@ of the Cologne Summit statement of June @card@ , it be state that we will work with the OECD towards common environmental guideline for institution that promote export . </s>
we aim to conclude this work by the time the G8 Summit be hold in @card@ . </s>
the G8 therefore recognise the importance of credit both for export and for the environment , and the importance of the work currently be do within the OECD on this subject . </s>
in @card@ , the OECD Ministerial Council meeting , in which I take part , welcome the progress make in draw up an OECD agreement on the exchange of environmental information on large project involve officially back export credit . </s>
the Council urge that work should continue , with the aim of strengthen common platform , pend a report on progress to be make to the next session of the Ministerial Council to be hold this year . </s>
as you know , the Member States of the European Union be play a central role in this process and in this discussion . </s>
with regard to the specific point of the Ilisu dam itself , discussion be take place between the Turkish authority and authority whose export credit agency be potential supplier of export credit insurance for those undertaking the project , who take a deliberate decision to make adequate safeguard for the environmental , social and cultural implication of this project . </s>
furthermore , it be in this context that a representative of the United Kingdom state in @card@ that he envisage guarantee that export credit insurance would take second place to safeguard the type of issue that you mention in your question , Mrs Lucas . </s>
the question of an export credit licence do not apply to this project . </s>
it be worth point out that , as funding for the project have not be request from the World Bank , there be no question of the Bank refuse to finance it . </s>
it could only refuse of course if such a request have be make . </s>
it go without say that the involvement of the Member States ' government and official export credit agency in the Ilisu dam project have be in compliance with European Union , OECD and G8 political and legal requirement and commitment , in the case of the G8 by those country belong to that group . </s>
the process of agree these common standard may have start as long ago as @card@ but clearly the fact that the British government appear to be go ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggest that it have not be very successful so far . </s>
I wonder if you would answer a question concern investment by Eu company in the Eu applicant country . </s>
I ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning 's discussion . </s>
on the one hand we ask applicant country to take on board the environmental acquis and yet , at the very same time , the Eu Member States be support and encourage investment in those country which be itself hugely environmentally damaging . </s>
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant country have feature in any of the discussion to date to which you have be refer ? </s>
- ( PT ) Mrs Lucas , I be not present at the debate you be refer to . </s>
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing , at a late date . </s>
question no 9 by ( H-0044 / @card@ ) : subject : environmental problem cause by the Drogheda Port Company development project , and the role of the court of auditor a major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interest have arise in the area of the Boyne Estuary , Ireland , follow a development project of the Drogheda Port Company . </s>
the affected area be designate a special Protection Area ( SPA ) under the Wild Birds Directive and be under consideration for a special area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive , as it be an area of international importance . </s>
Many local and European association have strongly criticise the project . </s>
similar case occur in other region of the Union , where Eu development funding conflict with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measure . </s>
be not the council of the opinion that the court of auditor should be give more resource in order to investigate or review similar development measure where environmental conflict arise ? </s>
What kind of measure do the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation power of the European institution in similar case ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) in response to your question , Mrs McKenna , I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the court of auditor be lay down in the Treaty establish the European Community . </s>
in accordance with Article @card@ of the Treaty , the auditing of account be carry out by the court of auditor which , to this end , study the account of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlie transaction . </s>
the Court also guarantee proper financial management . </s>
this be indeed also stipulate in Article @card@ . </s>
the court of auditor , therefore , already have all the instrument necessary to carry out its role . </s>
with regard to your suggestion for increase the Court 's resource , the Council consider that all of the Union 's institution have , under the Community budget , the necessary financial mean for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remit . </s>
in some case , it would probably be desirable for their financial resource to be increase , but there be budgetary restraint of which I be sure you be aware . </s>
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the European Union be approve by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament . </s>
the Council therefore , have no means of change the role confer on the court of auditor by the Treaty . </s>
if extra resource be give to the court of auditor it would be money well spend , because it would ensure that Eu funding be not go to something that conflict with environmental concern . </s>
for year the Council have be block the strategic development impact assessment of plan and programme . </s>
I would ask you , now that you be President of the Council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal . </s>
secondly , as there be no mention of structural fund in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ? </s>
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it be the council that have be block this for a long time . </s>
it be extremely important . </s>
if the court of auditor be able to assess regularly the potential conflict between environmental concern and structural development , it would be very important because the court of auditor could do an extremely good job . </s>
their report be extremely detailed and very important . </s>
this be the way to ensure that such conflict be avoid in the future . </s>
- ( PT ) Mrs McKenna , a large part of the problem you have raise relate to issue which be the responsibility of the Commission . </s>
it be therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development project comply with relevant environmental provision . </s>
the Commission will have to provide specific answer to these question . </s>
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quote . </s>
question no @card@ by ( H-0053 / @card@ ) : subject : statute for member of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament be go to try to reach agreement on a statute for the member of the European Parliament . </s>
One of the matter to be settle be whether member be to receive equal pay , and where they be to pay tax . </s>
accord to medium report the Portuguese Presidency consider that all member should pay the same tax , to the Eu . </s>
this be in conflict with the view take by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their member in their home country . </s>
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter ? </s>
. </s>
( PT ) the Portuguese Presidency be particularly interested in this issue , as I suppose that this be the first time a presidency have make resolve the problem of a statute for member of the European Parliament a priority in its programme . </s>
the Portuguese Presidency make reach an agreement on this statute one of its priority , as furthermore , do the President of the European Parliament , when she state this at the Helsinki European Council . </s>
we be therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter . </s>
we be therefore take advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outline of a compromise , and we have already begin work on this matter . </s>
it be worth point out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council , in accordance with Article @card@ , and the assent of this Parliament , to which it fall to approve this statute . </s>
the Presidency have engage in intensive discussion with a range of member of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrust the task of negotiate with the Council . </s>
I myself have an opportunity to meet this group , for the first time , in parallel with the January part-session , and I be try to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussion . </s>
these discussion have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant body of the Council , and I think that I can say , in a spirit of openness and great flexibility , and because we all recognise the importance that this have , particularly for the general public , that draw up this statute be a vital factor in ensure both the dignity of the function of member of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public fund . </s>
with regard more specifically to your question , I would like to highlight the fact that it only make sense to have a new statute if it represent progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensure that holder of identical post be as far as possible treat in the same way . </s>
this have , from the outset , be the position of the Portuguese Presidency . </s>
nevertheless , our role as mediator mean that we must take account of all current attitude in the Council and I be sure you be aware , Mr Sjöstedt , that the tax issue pose problem for certain delegation . </s>
as this be the case , whatever solution be find , I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States , regardless of their national position on the matter . </s>
What I can promise with regard to this issue be that the presidency have the utmost commitment to work , for as long as it be involve with this matter , in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards member of the European Parliament . </s>
we will also make the utmost effort with member of the Council , particularly with those who have most difficulty in accept the proposal suggest last year , so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution , and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the member of this House . </s>
Mr President , I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer . </s>
I want to ask two follow-up question connect with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarian . </s>
my basic view be that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one life , in which one 's family life and in which one benefit from public service . </s>
I intend to ask the presidency if there really be an argument for say that we should not pay tax in our own country just as other people do . </s>
be there any argument for our be give a special privilege just because we be parliamentarian ? </s>
that be my first question . </s>
my second question be about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involve the tax issue be be solve in different way for member of different nationality , or whether you want a solution which be identical for member of all nationality . </s>
- ( PT ) without wish to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your question deserve , I would rather not answer the question you have raise immediately . </s>
we be in the midst of rather sensitive negotiation . </s>
this sensitivity be reflect in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union express itself in a specific context in relation to particular situation . </s>
this have an impact of course , because it be read by other member of the Council . </s>
at this stage in the discussion , please forgive me if I can give a direct answer to the specific question that have be put to me . </s>
I would ask that we be judge on our result , when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future . </s>
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problem which may conceivably occur if a result be not reach , or to congratulate all of you if this result be achieve . </s>
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council , after his few hour work in this Chamber with these member of the European Parliament , whether he have come to any assessment of what they be worth in term of pay ? </s>
Mr Purvis , as this discussion of salary in the European Parliament do not relate exclusively to your country and even affect my country , I have a precise idea of what the salary of the member of the European Parliament be worth . </s>
I be therefore perfectly aware of this problem . </s>
Mr President , I want to thank you for your answer . </s>
I want to ask a follow-up question which bear some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt ask . </s>
we both come from Sweden . </s>
in our country , we pay our tax in the form of local taxis because the service concern be local . </s>
we have extensive service , too . </s>
we have problem stem from the lack of confidence in politician and , not least , in European politician here in Parliament . </s>
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politician would be affect if a situation be to arise in which we obtain the right to use service where we live - education , health care etc - but , at the same time , do not pay any tax and do not contribute ? </s>
How do you think a system like that would affect people 's confidence in ourselves as politician ? </s>
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I do not know whether you be oblige to answer this question since it be really a philosophical question . </s>
however , if you wish to enter into the realm of philosophy , go ahead ! </s>
. </s>
Mr President , I have no desire to enter into the realm of philosophy . </s>
these be fundamental issue which concern the very shape of the statute for member and of its role in the context of political society . </s>
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might , to use a French expression , préjuger the Portuguese Presidency 's view in the course of the negotiation in which it be involve on the statute for member . </s>
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from comment on this matter . </s>
since the time allot to question to the Council have elapse , Questions Nos @card@ to @card@ will be reply to in writing . </s>
that conclude question to the Council . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at @card@ p. m. ) Address by Mr Vaclav Havel , President of the Czech Republic Mr President in office , lady and gentleman , I have great honour in extend a warm welcome , on behalf of the House , to the President of the Czech Republic , Mr Vaclav Havel . </s>
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel , who be sit in the gallery . </s>
you be most welcome . </s>
( applause ) this be not your first visit to our Parliament , Mr President . </s>
you address plenary in Strasbourg nearly six year ago , in March @card@ , and many of us , who be already European member of Parliament at that time , still have a vivid recollection of your speech . </s>
in fact , shortly after the Maastricht Treaty be ratify , you speak in favour of strengthen European value , create a European ethical dimension and open the Union to the country of central and eastern Europe . </s>
in other word , for many citizen , and not just in your country , you personify the European value to which we constantly voice our attachment . </s>
There have be extremely dynamic development in relation between the Union and the Czech Republic follow two European election and a major new reform of the European treaty . </s>
an association agreement have be sign and a joint parliamentary committee have be set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament . </s>
your country file an official application to join the Union in @card@ and accession negotiation be finally officially open in @card@ . </s>
the process of European integration and enlargement have speed up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain . </s>
the end of this artificial separation of Europe mark the start of a new era . </s>
we now face an historical challenge with multiple prospect for all the citizen of Europe . </s>
Mr President , you be a symbol of these change . </s>
you found and sign Charter @card@ , the human right movement which represent and call for fundamental value during a dark period in the history of your people . </s>
a Communist regime sentence you to five year in prison for defend human freedom and dignity . </s>
but you never lose hope and history prove you right . </s>
Ten year ago , the &quot; velvet revolution &quot; proclaim Havel na HRAD . </s>
for ten year you represent democratic Czechoslovakia and , later , the Czech Republic , as its president . </s>
reconciliation with your neighbour be , and still be , a basic objective which you have defend with vigour and perseverance . </s>
you be a first class European . </s>
today , the Czech Republic be prepare to join our union . </s>
I be sure that you will agree , Mr President , and experience have show us , that the process of enlargement of the Union be not without its pitfall for both party and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criterion . </s>
the European Union , for its part , will need to adapt its institution and policy in order to prepare for enlargement . </s>
it have already take a big step forward with Agenda @card@ . </s>
the next step , i. e. institutional reform , will be take follow the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference , in which the European Parliament will be fully involve . </s>
our responsibility as member of the European Parliament be to ensure that the process of enlargement take place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that , when the time come , the citizen of the European Union and the citizen of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European union through their elected representative . </s>
Mr President , it give me great pleasure to give you the floor . </s>
( applause ) Madam President , member of the European Parliament , lady and gentleman , the question of whether , deep down , a European have a sense of European identity , alongside a sense or awareness of national identity , crop up time and time again nowadays . </s>
in other word , do Europeans really feel they be European or be it more of an abstract idea , a theoretical concept design to repackage a geographical factor as a state of mind ? </s>
this question also crop up during the debate on the degree of sovereignty which the nation state can and should transfer to the institution of the European Union . </s>
some insist that if a clearly-felt national identity be eclipse too quickly by a European identity which few feel , or which be even perceive as fanciful , then thing be sure to take a turn for the bad . </s>
so what exactly do we mean by Europeanism ? </s>
if I look deep into my heart and try to identify the point at which I start to feel European , and what unite me to Europe , the first thing I feel be mild surprise at the fact that it be only now , under the pressure of topical political issue and duty , that I even ask myself the question . </s>
why do I not put this question to myself a long time ago , when I start to make my way in the world and reflect on the world and my place in it ? </s>
do I consider my attachment to Europe as a purely extrinsic factor of little significance , a factor which do not need to concern , let alone torment , me ? </s>
or , on the contrary , do I consider my Europeanism as so self-evident that it do not warrant interrogation , examination or further think ? </s>
the second proposition be the more likely : everything with which I have always identify myself be so naturally European that it never occur to me to consider it as such . </s>
I simply do not see any point in qualify it or , generally , in associate my way of think with a specific continent . </s>
furthermore , I have the feeling that , as a young man , I might well have feel slightly silly say or write that I be a European , that my perception and way of thinking be European or even explicitly claim that I be from Europe . </s>
it would have seem profoundly pathetic and presumptuous , a more arrogant version of the national patriotism which have always embarrass me . </s>
in other word , I be so obviously and naturally European that I do not even think about it . </s>
and I be sure that apply to the majority of Europeans . </s>
they be profoundly European but they be not even aware of it , they do not hang that label round their neck , which be why opinion poll show that they be somewhat surprise at have to shout their Europeanism from the rooftop . </s>
There do not appear to be a great tradition of consider Europeanism in Europe . </s>
that be not necessarily a good thing and I welcome with satisfaction the fact that our Europeanism be start to emerge clearly today from the vast melting pot of concept which &quot; speak for themselves &quot; . </s>
question , consider and try to define it , help us enormously in understand ourselves . </s>
it be become a determine factor in the multicultural and multifaceted world in which we live , in which the capacity to perceive one 's own identity be a prerequisite to peaceful coexistence with other identity . </s>
moreover , if Europe have think so little about its own identity in the past , that be no doubt because it consider itself , wrongly , to be the entire world ; or at least it consider itself to be good than the rest of the world , because it do not feel the need to define itself in relation to other . </s>
which , of course , have unfortunate consequence as far as its actual conduct be concern . </s>
think about Europeanism mean ask what set of value , ideal or principle put you in mind of the notion of Europe , even what be typical of Europe . </s>
more than that , it also mean start from the very essence of the thing , examine the whole concept critically . </s>
and , hence , quickly realise that numerous European tradition , value or principle be typically highly ambiguous and may lead to ruin if exaggerate , exploit or abuse . </s>
if Europe have enter an era of self-examination , that mean that it wish to define itself in relation to other and , also , that it want to identify what be good about itself , what have prove its worth and what should be retain for the future . </s>
when I first have the honour of address this House six year ago , I mention the need to emphasise the spiritual dimension , and the importance of the value of European integration , and I confide my fear that the spiritual , historic , political and civilise aspect of Europe might be hijack by question of a technical , economic , financial or administrative nature which risk upset the public . </s>
at the time , my word sound somewhat provocative and I expect to be boo out of the House . </s>
but no such thing happen and it be satisfy to note that these same word now no longer sound provocative at all . </s>
the dramatic change in Europe since the iron curtain fall ten year ago , the increasingly obvious need to enlarge the European Union , faster and faster economic integration and the array of new threat be generate by present circumstance be also factor which have force the European Union to open its mind to renewed , more intense introspection and to identify and redefine the value which unite it and give it purpose . </s>
the idea be occasionally moot that this quest have come too late , that cultural and political integration and introspection should have precede economic integration ; in other word , that we have start from the wrong end . </s>
I do not think that be a fair judgement . </s>
after the Second World War , democratic western Europe have to deal with the memory of the horror of two world war and the threat of the spread of totalitarian communism . </s>
at the time , it be almost superfluous to discuss which value need to be protect . </s>
they stick out a mile . </s>
on the contrary , the west need to unite technically , as it be , post haste , in order to prevent the possible emergence or even the proliferation of dictatorship and a relapse into old national conflict . </s>
doubtless the same apply to my feeling of Europeanism : it come to me so naturally over the year , or even the decade , that it do not even occur to me to claim it explicitly . </s>
for western Europe , everything which it need to protect be so obvious that it do not feel any press need to define it , analyse it , pull it apart or translate it into various political or institutional act . </s>
thus , just as I have only now come to ask myself if I feel European and to consider what that mean , so the democratic Europe under construction have doubtless be force by the historic event of the last decade to reflect on the very basis for its unification and its objective in great depth . </s>
in my view , the main European value , as shape by the turbulent spiritual and political history of Europe , and as adopt by other part of the world , or at least some part of the world , be obvious . </s>
respect for the individual and for his freedom , his right and his dignity , the principle of solidarity , equality before the law and the rule of law , protection of all ethnic minority , democratic institution , separation of the legislative , executive and judicial estate , political pluralism , respect for private property and free enterprise , a market economy and the development of the civil society . </s>
the form which these value currently assume naturally reflect countless modern European experience , include the fact that our continent be become a main multicultural crossroad . </s>
I should like to dwell , for reason which I shall explain , on one of these fundamental value . </s>
I refer to the civil society . </s>
in the western world , i. e. in today 's Euro-American world , a richly construct , open , decentralise civil society base on trust in the sovereign independence of its citizen and their various association , form the basis of the democratic state and guarantee its political stability . </s>
if the European Union be shortly to open its door to new democracy and , in my view , it be in its vital interest to do so , it be extremely important , if not of capital importance , that it help to reconstruct and develop the civil society in these country . </s>
it be not by chance that , shortly after it come to power , the communist dictatorship shredded and then eradicate the fabric of civil society as quickly as possible . </s>
it know full well that it would never gain real control of the people while the various grass-roots structure of the civil society continue to function . </s>
What remain of a genuine civil society live and develop in direct or indirect resistance . </s>
and European value survive in this milieu not thank to the political regime , but in spite of it . </s>
the way in which society structure itself can , of course , be impose from on high . </s>
but the climate and the condition which be conducive to its development can be put in place . </s>
in this sense , aid for new democracy should be give in the wide context of the sustainable development and reinforcement of the civil society at pan-European level . </s>
the more varied , differentiate and interlink the various civil European structure , the more willing the new democracy will be to join them and the faster the principle of trust in the citizen and subsidiarity will apply in them , thereby reinforce their stability . </s>
but that be not all : the foundation of the European union as a supranational community will grow all the strong . </s>
specifically , that mean that one of the first job be to transfer certain social solidarity task to local authority and non-profit-making or public-sector organisation . </s>
the low the level at which resource be redistribute , the more transparent and economic this redistribution will be , provide good coverage of the multifarious need of society , which be difficult to define from the centre , and create social solidarity which be all the more genuine for be distinctly link to specific person or association of person . </s>
this genuine solidarity between citizen , social group , community and region be the good basis for solidarity which can be dispense by a single entity , I. E. the state . </s>
and in a supranational entity as big as the European Union , which need to function as an instrument of solidarity , the real civil foundation must be even more strong and even rich . </s>
the viability of the European Union therefore depend mainly , perhaps above all , on the spirit in which its citizen accept a civil European identity . </s>
an increase awareness of all the symptom or manifestation of national egotism , xenophobia or racial intolerance should clearly form part of this new sense of European identity . </s>
the policy of appeasement which culminate in the capitulation to evil in Munich be one of the bitter chapter of modern European history . </s>
this experience should encourage us to be vigilant . </s>
evil need to be nip in the bud and it be not enough that there be government to do so . </s>
the attitude of government should be inform by the attitude of its citizen . </s>
the concern for security be another expression of social solidarity . </s>
this be the job of the state or of a supranational grouping . </s>
the European Union have start work intensively on a new concept for its security policy . </s>
the overriding feature of this policy should be its capacity to take decision quickly and transform them equally quickly into action . </s>
I think that be extremely important . </s>
it be also high time . </s>
surely , recent experience in Yugoslavia have a great deal to teach us on this subject . </s>
in my view , the intervention by NATO demonstrate several thing quite clearly . </s>
first , respect for life and human dignity and the concern for European security may , under certain circumstance , call for intervention beyond the border of the European Union . </s>
of course , the strong the mandate for such intervention , the well . </s>
however , one can also imagine the unfortunate situation in which there be no UN mandate and yet intervention be in the interest of the whole of Europe and human civilisation as we know it . </s>
I be not convince that Europe be prepare , even recently , to deal with such a disastrous eventuality . </s>
it be certainly more prepare now , at least psychologically , and I think that it should capitalise on this and finalise its material and technical arrangement . </s>
secondly , more effort need to be make in the area of preventive security . </s>
in Kosovo and Serbia , as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other part of former Yugoslavia , ten of thousand of human life and countless property could have be save if the international community have be capable of appropriate reaction earlier , when the conflict break out . </s>
( applause ) unfortunately , despite all the appeal , despite all the warning of possible or imminent atrocity , nothing happen . </s>
One of the possible , conceivable reason be a preoccupation with a variety of individual and material interest and the inability of government team to rake risk in the name of a good cause and the great good . </s>
thirdly , the United States play the lead role in this particular instance and it be highly probable that , without their intervention , the international community , not know what to do , would today still be witness the atrocity which lead to intervention in Kosovo . </s>
but Europe can rely indefinitely on the United States , especially when it come to European problem . </s>
it should be capable of find a solution and resolve the situation itself . </s>
it be unthinkable in today 's world , where small entity legitimately unite in international or supranational community , that the European Union can continue to be a respected member of the world order if it be unable to agree on how to defend human right , not only on its own territory but within its sphere of action , i. e. in the area which may , one day , belong to it . </s>
I think , as I say a moment ago , that enlargement be in the vital interest of the European Union . </s>
allow me to reiterate and highlight this conviction . </s>
it stem perhaps from the experience of a man who live for forty year under communist rule , precede by Nazi domination , or from the individual experience of an inhabitant of a country at the very centre of Europe which , over the century , have become the crossroad of various spiritual current and European geopolitical interest , even the birthplace of more than one European conflict . </s>
All this lead me to the firm conviction that Europe be the only political entity whose security must be undivided . </s>
the idea of two Europe live cheek by jowl , the idea of a democratic , stable , prosperous Europe on the road to integration and a less democratic , less stable and less prosperous Europe be , in my view , completely illusory . </s>
it sound like the idea of sustainable coexistence in a room which be half flood and half dry . </s>
despite its difference , Europe be indivisible , and anything serious which happen to it will have repercussion on , and consequence for , the rest of the continent . </s>
as a single political entity , Europe have an opportunity today which it have never have throughout its turbulent history ; the opportunity to construct a profoundly fair and peaceful order base on the principle of equality and cooperation by all side . </s>
no more act of violence perpetrate by the powerful on the less powerful ; instead , understanding and general consensus , however difficult they be and however long they take to achieve , should be the guiding principle behind the structure and stability of Europe in the next millennium . </s>
in this context , I understand Europe to mean the continent as a whole . </s>
we all know that the process of enlargement of the European Union need to be accompany by continual and ambitious reform of its institution . </s>
I be sure that the Intergovernmental Conference will make realistic proposal which will send the European union in the right direction . </s>
however , institutional change within the European Union must not stop there . </s>
on the contrary , it must be the start of a very long process , possibly take several decade , in which the overriding concern be to speed up and simplify decision-making within the European Union and make it more transparent . </s>
allow me to mention two more specific point which I have allude to on several occasion and which could , in my view , help to achieve these objective in the more distant future . </s>
first , I believe that the European Union should , sooner or later , have a clear , accurate , universally understandable constitution ... ( Applause ) ... a constitution which every child in Europe can simply learn at school . </s>
this constitution would comprise two part , as be standard practice . </s>
the first part would set out the fundamental right and duty of the European citizen and state , the fundamental value on which a unite Europe be base and the sense and purpose of the European structure . </s>
the second would describe the main institution of the European Union , their main power and the relation between them . </s>
the fact of have a constitution would not automatically radically transform the union of state as we know it into the federal superstate which the eurosceptics dread ; it would simply give the people of the Europe under construction a clear idea of the nature of the European Union , thereby allow them to understand it good and identify with it . </s>
( applause ) One of the important question often rightly raise in connection with institutional reform be how the Union will ensure that the small Member States can rest assure that they will not be relegate to a minority by the large Member States , even take due account of the size of the various state . </s>
it seem to me that one possibility might be to create a second chamber in the European Parliament . </s>
it would not , of course , be directly elect ; instead the various parliament would send delegation of perhaps three deputy per state . </s>
the first chamber , I. E. the current parliament , would reflect the size of the various Member States , while the second would reinforce their equality because all Member States would have the same number of deputy . </s>
this would mean that the Commission , for example , would not need to have one member per state and the national parliament could be involve in a much more &quot; hand on &quot; manner . </s>
whatever the process or outcome of institutional reform or the reform which I mention , one thing would appear to be certain : disagreement or the absence of consensus on institutional issue should not hamper the enlargement of the European Union . </s>
be it to do so , too great a delay might have far more dangerous consequence than the failure to complete institutional reform . </s>
lady and Gentlemen , the technical civilisation which cover the entire planet be bear in Europe and have be highly influence by certain aspect of the Euro-American civilisation . </s>
Europe therefore bear a great deal of responsibility for the state of this civilisation . </s>
however , this responsibility should never take the form of forcibly enforce its own value , idea or heritage on the rest of the world . </s>
on the contrary , Europe should , at long last , get its own act together and serve as an example which other may , but be not oblige to , follow . </s>
the whole modern perception of life as continual material progress and growth , base on the assurance of man , who see himself as the master of the universe , be the hidden and regrettable face of the European spiritual tradition . </s>
this perception of life also predetermine the threatening side of our current civilisation . </s>
who , if not this part of the world , should vigorously oppose these threat , give that it be this part of the world which start this trend , send our civilisation into free fall ? </s>
it seem to me that , at this turn point in time , it be up to Europe to take a good look at its equivocal contribution to the world and to realise that we have not only teach the world human right , we have also show it the Holocaust . </s>
we be the spiritual mentor not only for the industrial and then the information revolution , but also when it come to disfigure nature in the name of rampant materialism , pillage its resource and pollute its atmosphere . </s>
we need to understand that , yes , we do open the way to huge development in science and technology ; but we do so at an exorbitant price by do away with a whole set of very important and complex human experience form over several millennium . </s>
Europe need to get its own act together first . </s>
it can make saving , impose hardship , respect - in the well spiritual tradition - the high cosmic order as something which be above and beyond us and respect the moral order as the consequence of that high order . </s>
humility , affability , kindness , respect for what we do not understand , a deep feeling of solidarity with other , respect for what be different , the willingness to make sacrifice or do good deed which eternity alone can reward , the eternity which watch us , silently , through the eye of our conscience . </s>
these be the value which could and should be on the agenda as we construct Europe . </s>
Europe bear all or some of the responsibility for the most horrific event of the 20th century : two world war , fascism and the totalitarian communist regime . </s>
over the last century , Europe witness three positive event , not all of which be of its do : the end of colonial domination , the fall of the iron curtain and the emergence of the European structure . </s>
in my view , the fourth major mission which await Europe be to try and show , by its very existence , that it be possible to counter the huge danger which our contradictory civilisation allow to hover over the planet . </s>
I would be happy if my country could take part in all this as a fully paid-up partner . </s>
thank you for your attention . </s>
( long and enthusiastic stand ovation ) Mr President , allow me , on behalf of the European Parliament , to extend our warm thank for the clear message which you have bring and of which the member have already show their appreciation . </s>
thank you . </s>
you be right to remind us that a national identity be perfectly compatible with a European identity . </s>
and you have use your personal experience to show us that your European identity be not decree ; it be a spontaneous and natural move . </s>
I have take note of your word ; this be something which we all feel very deeply . </s>
we find you faithful to the principle which have always guide you , which have always guide your action ; your attachment to fundamental value . </s>
you remind us of your speech in @card@ , which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative , but there be such a thing as creative Utopia and we have be able to gauge together how far we have come . </s>
and you very opportunely highlight the role of the civil society , the importance of the civil society , not just in the candidate country , but in all the country in the European Union , in restore our citizen ' confidence , in restore confidence in the social solidarity which we need . </s>
To summarise , perhaps what strike me most in your speech ; above all , you wish to remind us that , beyond its economic aspect , the task of construct Europe be a spiritual one . </s>
we of course look forward most keenly to continue this task with you . </s>
thank you , Mr President . </s>
( the formal sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) ACP-EU Joint Assembly the next item be the annual report ( A5-0032 / @card@ ) by Mr Corrie , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the result of the activity of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in @card@ . </s>
, rapporteur . </s>
- Mr President , I have hope to be rise at 9 a. m. , not 9 p. m. , to present this report . </s>
I hope the number of member in this Chamber be not an indication of the interest in overseas development work . </s>
however , it be normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly be put before member of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of do that tonight . </s>
once again , I can report two highly successful Assemblies have take place , one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau . </s>
in many way this be the end of an old era and the start of a new one . </s>
the ACP-EU Joint Assembly be a unique organisation in world politics . </s>
where else do @card@ nation come together to discuss matter of mutual concern ? </s>
the Strasbourg Assembly be the last chair by Lord Plumb . </s>
in honour of the tremendous work he carry out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau make him an honorary president , and we wish him well in his retirement . </s>
the two Assemblies have be dominate by the negotiation on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new convention and its rapid ratification by all the country concern . </s>
I remember that at the last mid-term review , when I be rapporteur , the then Commissioner Marin say that review would be the last . </s>
well , he be wrong , and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have work so successfully behind the scene to conclude a new convention in very difficult circumstance . </s>
I be also delight to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who have work untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiation . </s>
I pay special tribute to him for his success . </s>
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her work group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé . </s>
I be quite sure that Mrs Kinnock 's report and the one on regional cooperation and integration have a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiation . </s>
I also thank the working group on the small island state and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent report . </s>
we have have question time to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP council , and I would like to thank those institution for their interest in our work . </s>
the main thrust of our work in both Assemblies be poverty eradication . </s>
the resolution pass go so far as to say that poverty amount to a violation of human right . </s>
it also emphasise the importance of abolish gender inequality and as I travel through Africa and see the work do by woman I only wish there be more woman in senior government position and in presidential post . </s>
we might then see an end to some of the fraud , corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some country and that have to be stop . </s>
we have , as usual , many debate on country where there be war situation . </s>
I visit Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge . </s>
the OAU be do its good to broker a peace deal there . </s>
but Ethiopia be still call for clarification on certain issue and the humanitarian situation in both country be serious . </s>
we be delight to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement be be reach with South Africa after four year of negotiation . </s>
this highlight the problem of coherence between the Eu and the develop nation , which come to a head at the WTO talk in Seattle . </s>
much work have to be do to convince the develop nation of the advantage of globalisation and world free-trade agreement . </s>
in Nassau , we have two interesting debate on East Timor and Cuba . </s>
Cuba have observer status but I understand have now show a wish to join the ACP . </s>
all nation from within the confine of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirement of democracy , human right , governance and an independent judiciary be , I be sure , welcome . </s>
I await with interest development in Cuba . </s>
when Mr Dalmau , the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs address the assembly , he do not hesitate to let his feeling be know . </s>
on East Timor , Mr Da Costa , from the Timorese National Resistance Council , give a very move address indicate that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it become a state with a government . </s>
we must give them all our support to reach that goal . </s>
human right be such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have be appoint with special responsibility for monitor human right closely and report to the assembly . </s>
a number of case have be highlight , include the child soldier issue in Sudan , where many child have be abduct from neighbour state . </s>
I have the honour of be elect the European co-president at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius be the new ACP co-president . </s>
I would like to see a number of change to our assembly , particularly after the signing of the new convention in May . </s>
we must have more equality between our ACP partner and our European member and I want to get rid of the &quot; them and us &quot; syndrome . </s>
firstly , I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elect member from ACP country and not ambassador or government minister sit there as delegate . </s>
this I think be the new convention . </s>
secondly , the new convention allow for regional assembly in the six region , which would allow us to be much more specific in our work . </s>
these assembly would report back to the Joint Assembly . </s>
we have a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this be extremely productive . </s>
we be go to have one in Abuja in West Africa too . </s>
I want the assembly to stop be just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in develop country . </s>
I want to see civil society give a loud voice . </s>
but to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on . </s>
we must reward those nation which be make the effort to live by the rule of good governance . </s>
equally , we should come down hard on those who be corrupt or whose constitution do not allow the pluralist government that we demand . </s>
I be delight to see the result in Zimbabwe . </s>
European taxpayer will no longer accept their taxis be fraudulently use . </s>
a new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standard must be set and live up to . </s>
the Joint Assembly should play a lead role in monitor the enactment of good governance , human right and democracy in cooperation with the Commission . </s>
I believe that as equal partner the EU- and ACP-elected delegate be up to that task . </s>
I beg to move acceptance of this report . </s>
Mr President , let me begin by congratulate Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report . </s>
our approach to development policy must always be base on respect for human right and the fight against poverty . </s>
but there be a crass contradiction between fight poverty and the cut in development aid appropriation in many Member States and in the Eu . </s>
with regard to financing , we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional fund so that , for instance , we can send delegation to the ACP state to oversee electoral process , at their invitation . </s>
in future , the Eu must take a far more multilateral approach when it agree development project and , furthermore , must coordinate more closely with the individual state in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively . </s>
an example here could be the field of education , which will deserve and need special support in the ACP state in future . </s>
for instance , the very rapidly grow educational and technological potential of the Internet offer entirely new mean of help the develop country , which at present still have modest resource , to move towards a global approach , as oppose to globalisation . </s>
I see it as a future task of the Eu to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprise in the ACP state , which can promote self-help . </s>
an example here be the problem in Nigeria , which import industrial finished product from all over the world and then have to spend substantial resource on product maintenance by foreign worker . </s>
One way forward to promote the set up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately . </s>
it will be easy to take account of the develop country ' very diverse problem , and Eu aid could be prepare and implement in a more targeted manner if , as the report make quite clear , we take the urgently need step of optimise our work method , by introduce the propose regional assembly . </s>
thank you , Mr Zimmerling : if I be inform correctly , this be the first time you be address this House . </s>
congratulation on your maiden speech : it go really well . </s>
Mr President , it can be repeat often enough : since @card@ , the Lomé Convention have constitute an important pillar of European development cooperation and have a pilot role to play in many respect . </s>
base as it be on the principle of partnership and equality , and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly , it be an example to the world . </s>
most appropriately , give that this year we be celebrate @card@ year of cooperation under Lomé , we will shortly be sign a new and more advanced partnership agreement , which also upgrade the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both side . </s>
so I do not want to look back only to the year @card@ . </s>
the rapporteur , Mr Corrie , have already do so most expertly . </s>
much of what concern us today be the outcome of fundamental process of transformation in all part of the world since the late 1980s . </s>
they also have strong repercussion in the develop country . </s>
the after-shocks can still be feel . </s>
ACP cooperation be a dynamic process . </s>
the content of the agreement have progress steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI . </s>
at the same time the number of partner state have increase considerably , now stand at @card@ . </s>
All those involve be particularly move by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa . </s>
Cuba have just knock at the door , and , if Cuba be also accept into the ACP-EU community , that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake process of change in Cuba itself . </s>
so ACP cooperation remain very exciting , and not only because of the new emphasis introduce in the new convention . </s>
fight poverty and promote sustain economic , cultural and social development be important objective in the endeavour to build up democratic society , base on respect for human right , in the ACP state . </s>
that also mean strengthen the democratic institution . </s>
the history of the Joint Assembly provide impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction . </s>
in the past , the representative of the ACP country tend to be government member , government official or ambassador ; but today at least three quarter of the ACP delegate be elect member of parliament . </s>
we ought to throw a big party when the figure reach @card@ % in the near future , which be indeed what the new convention be aim at . </s>
unfortunately there be far too little appreciation of the steady advance of process of democratisation which , unlike the various crisis that arise , largely pass unnoticed . </s>
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP state be regional cooperation and integration . </s>
There be one wish on the European Parliament 's long wish list that will be fulfill : as we have already hear , the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assembly . </s>
enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflict base on ethnic , economic , social or religious factor , i. e. have a preventive effect . </s>
for the same reason the European Parliament have always call for civil society to be involve in the decision-making process and in cooperation management , and emphasise the importance of decentralise cooperation . </s>
the enhanced contact between the Joint Assembly and the social partner provide for in the new convention be another step in the right direction . </s>
but I be a little sad that the European Development Fund have still not be incorporate in the Community budget . </s>
I hope it do not take another @card@ year before we finally achieve that too . </s>
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report . </s>
the Lomé Convention have be an expression of a real partnership between the Eu and the ACP country for over @card@ year . </s>
that it have continue at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarter , include the WTO , be a triumph of sort . </s>
but of course the new convention must be measure not by the fact that it exist but by the extent to which it can contribute to the Eu commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development target . </s>
measure by this yardstick there be a number of serious shortcoming in the new arrangement . </s>
for example , the agreement be particularly disappointing for those ACP country suffer from short-term fluctuation in export earning . </s>
during a marathon negotiate session in December a compromise be reach which provide that , in respect of least-developed , landlocked and island state , assistance would be provide in the event of a minimum 2 % loss of export earning rather than the level of @card@ % for the other ACP state . </s>
but at the final negotiate session the Eu claim that it have never actually agree to the inclusion of island and landlocked state among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2 % threshold . </s>
this change have be devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangement . </s>
this seem a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands be one of the small and most vulnerable of the ACP state and they be now go to have to pay the high price for this new Lomé arrangement . </s>
meanwhile , on the trade side , pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention be WTO-compatible have mean that there be a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangement or free-trade agreement . </s>
Non-least-developed country be likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangement . </s>
yet it be quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of country will simply be unable to open their market yet to the chill wind of free trade without wreck their own domestic economy . </s>
we therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine option be open to those country which be not yet ready for free-trade arrangement . </s>
we need to ensure that strategy for promote regional integration within the ACP be pursue in their own right . </s>
finally , during any new trade round the Eu and the ACP state should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article @card@ in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreement between structurally and economically dissimilar group of country . </s>
the Lomé Convention be a unique partnership ; but if it be to be truly effective it need to extend beyond the discussion within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora . </s>
Mr President , what I want to do in this debate be condemn the fate reserve for the poor country of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific . </s>
people have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention , but even look at trading relation alone , the Lomé Convention have do nothing to protect those country ; their already feeble share in trade with Europe have be halve . </s>
that reflect the growth of inequality between Eu and ACP country . </s>
the Lomé Convention essentially benefit a few large industrial or financial conglomerate , which continue to pillage those country and perpetuate their economic dependence , notably on the former colonial power . </s>
when it come to so-called development aid , give that underdevelopment in the majority of these country be get worse rather than good , development be clearly not what the aid be for , even when it be not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturer . </s>
the aid be primarily a windfall for incumbent regime , and the poor majority do not benefit at all . </s>
even if it be properly redirect this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care , education or drinking water supply . </s>
for some year now the great power have be reduce the amount of this already derisory aid , and it be the height of cynicism when this be do on the pretext of human right violation or corruption . </s>
after all , who protect these deeply corrupt regime , if not the government of the rich country ? </s>
they turn a blind eye to the master of corruption , the big group control oil , water supply , or public work . </s>
they could clamp down on them since their head office be here in Europe . </s>
the debate about either extend the Lomé Convention with its quota and protectionism , or , instead , gradually wind down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP country in the name of free trade , be a warp debate between two way of perpetuate the pillage and impoverishment of those country . </s>
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemn hundred of million of human being to a wretched death to enrich a minority . </s>
a mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulate by the big group could lift these poor country out of extreme poverty , but , until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist group , we be just cover up the real problem . </s>
Mr President , I want to thank the co-president of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly , Mr Corrie . </s>
it be no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly . </s>
in this speech , I will confine myself to address certain point I consider fundamental . </s>
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary , urge all ACP country to send member of their national parliament as their representative , so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric . </s>
my next contribution to the debate be to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO , which be see by the ACP country as an enormous danger to their development . </s>
I do believe the ACP country need a transition period , but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid , not only in agriculture and fishery , but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resource , some of which be be exploit , with slim economic return to the ACP country themselves . </s>
thirdly , the European Parliament - through a joint work group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP country ' budget through the selection of budgetary item to permit economic and , above all , social development , and by monitor income and fiscal policy in force in the ACP country . </s>
we must put the people of the ACP country first in our relationship with their ruler , who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union be intend for the people and not for the oligarchy that handle all the internal and external resource in some country . </s>
fourthly , and finally , the prevention of inter-ethnic conflict between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieve either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposal I have set out . </s>
Mr President , I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker have just make and I want to add that Mr Corrie have start his term as co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation . </s>
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which take place a few day ago , partly as a consequence of event allude to in the report we be debate here . </s>
I refer to Cuba 's expression of intent , of 2 February , to become a full member of the ACP group of country . </s>
a Cuban delegation attend the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau , and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau speak in the plenary session , engage in a lively debate , and afterwards hold conversation with many of us . </s>
follow Nassau , a delegation from Parliament lead by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , Joaquín Miranda , visit Havana and a series of very illuminate exchange of opinion take place . </s>
it be my impression that this mission from the European Parliament be the final push which convince our Cuban friend that the time have come to move forward on mechanism of cooperation with the European Union . </s>
we be witness event of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union , so that Cuba 's aspiration can meet with a positive response as soon as possible . </s>
that be important , for at least three reason . </s>
first , it be important for Cuba , to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade , which have be repeatedly condemn by the European Parliament and the United Nations . </s>
secondly , we must bear in mind that Cuba 's application have the support of all the ACP country . </s>
if the European Union respond positively to the recommendation of our associate , we will be prove our respect and consideration for those associate and this will have positive effect on the whole framework of our cooperation with them . </s>
nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrate the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it do not bow to pressure from any quarter . </s>
by accept Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrate that our Europe be not involve in the shameful process of ' play but not pay ' , and that , when we get indignant about absurdity like the Helms-Burton Act , we be not be hypocritical but be ready to act and take all the consequence . </s>
the ACP-EU Joint Assembly meet again in a few week time and I be sure this subject will be deal with there . </s>
ideally the European Parliament 's representative should be able to support Cuba 's intent at those proceeding , as our parliamentary colleague from the ACP country will no doubt be do . </s>
of course , Cuba must meet all the standard condition , just like any other member . </s>
the Cubans know that and I be sure they accept it . </s>
it must also be make clear that Cuba be not go to be ask for more than have be ask of our other partner . </s>
Cuba 's wish to join be welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle . </s>
I say that wholeheartedly , but also with the deep conviction that , just as the blockade have produce nothing but poverty and , as a consequence of that , extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position , the integration we be support here , and the prosperity it will produce , will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us , especially the Cuban people , will benefit . </s>
Mr President , I also want to begin by thank and congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Corrie , for an excellent report which I think very well describe and summarise the work which have be do in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of @card@ . </s>
I do not have very long in which to speak , and I really only want to take up two question . </s>
the first be about the fight against poverty , which I think be become an embarrassment both for the Eu and the Member States . </s>
in spite of the fact that , both in the Treaty and at the UN 's meeting in Rio and Copenhagen , there be an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world , the budget for development aid be , in actual fact , be cut back , when the express desire be that exactly the opposite should happen . </s>
we must put a stop to this trend . </s>
we must begin by write off debt . </s>
we must follow up word with action . </s>
I should like us to take a lead role in this work . </s>
my second question concern the fact that , in many context , we talk about the ACP country have to learn the principle of democracy . </s>
paragraph 2 and 3 of the resolution demand , within the context of the new agreement , that working method should be develop and optimise . </s>
the ACP country be to be urge to allow a whole range of political opinion to come up for discussion . </s>
I think that be a very good idea indeed , and I fully subscribe to it . </s>
however , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangement . </s>
How do these operate within the European Parliament 's delegation to the ACP-EU 's Joint Assembly ? </s>
in contrast to how thing be do here in the European Parliament and in Parliament 's committee , where rapporteur be nominate and appoint to produce report , there be no regulation whatsoever apply within this delegation to the Joint Assembly . </s>
the two large group share all the report and consultative document etc between themselves . </s>
in order to change this undemocratic arrangement , we , the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , have table Amendment no 6 in which we request that the rapporteur appoint to produce report and consultative document , together with the member of work party , should be appoint in accordance with clear , democratic rule . </s>
in this context , account ought to be take of the small group , and consideration give to introduce more representative arrangement . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report , which appropriately reflect the tenor of the debate in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chair . </s>
the eradication of poverty be central to our work and many speaker highlight the need to preserve an essential tool for achieve that ambitious aim , to whit , preferential agreement between the European Union and the ACP country within the framework of the Lomé Conventions . </s>
the challenge be immense . </s>
Globalisation , free trade , and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy , be imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue . </s>
so we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development , and personally I be convince that the work of the last Joint Assembly do have a decisive influence on break the deadlock in the negotiation , as do the new climate create by the event at Seattle . </s>
however , while I welcome the renewal of the agreement , what I find most interesting be the new wind blow through our relationship and find expression in the balanced nature of the negotiation now draw to a close . </s>
the European Union seem to me to have finally emerge from the old paternalist , or frankly neo-colonialist , logic where those give aid be all too eager to start give lesson , follow a formula our friend Michel Rocard be so keen on . </s>
the Union have finally accept the idea that dialogue can be genuine or effective unless it be the expression of a contract which respect the dignity of the partner . </s>
by refuse to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool , in the hand of technocrat , for impose new set of condition , the European Union be demonstrate wisdom and modesty . </s>
we have spend two century lay the foundation of a democracy whose fragility be constantly bring home to us by event . </s>
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history , value and identity be sometimes so profoundly different from our own ? </s>
personally , I prefer the willingness that be clearly flag up in these agreement to extend the partnership to new agent - local authority , non-governmental organisation - which seem to me to represent the only possible way the people of these country can progressively achieve ownership cooperation . </s>
in short , this be the only way they can emerge from humiliate and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves , the proof of success . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report . </s>
the European Parliament 's opinion on the activity of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly have always have a major impact , undeniably contribute to a consistent policy and role for the European union in development and cooperation . </s>
the important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthen relation between the European Union and the ACP country need to be stress . </s>
in view of this positive action , there be every advantage to be gain from accord the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improve the quality of its work . </s>
we back the rapporteur 's proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assembly , under the aegis of the Joint Assembly , in the six region of the convention : the Caribbean , the Pacific and four African region . </s>
these regional assembly would monitor action in their respective area . </s>
poverty have be the common denominator of all the debate in the Joint Assembly and its eradication be the priority for the European Union 's development policy . </s>
in line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting , we must concentrate on meet the poverty reduction target agree by the international community . </s>
consistency and action be need . </s>
the next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local body . </s>
the participation of local body be absolutely essential . </s>
in a wide context , the priority , as I see it , be to convert poor country ' debt into programme for poverty eradication and sustainable development , as well as control of fraud and corruption . </s>
we need to make progress with concrete and consistent action . </s>
people in the poor country be begin to despair . </s>
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one mean , amongst other , of promote the eradication of poverty and accelerate its economic , cultural and social development , in order to strengthen its internal democratisation . </s>
finally , I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the come Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participant to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace , democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped country of Africa . </s>
. </s>
( da ) Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in @card@ . </s>
I be also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participate in the Joint Assembly 's next meeting , which take place in March in Nigeria . </s>
the Commission be please to see the Joint Assembly play a large role , especially in connection with promote a more extensive political dialogue with our partner in development . </s>
the Commission agree with the rapporteur that combat poverty continue to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role . </s>
in order to be able to develop , the country concern must , however , become actively involve in the global economic system . </s>
with regard to trade with our partner in development , the Commission be quite prepare to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP country ' special economic and social limitation . </s>
Mrs Lucas mention that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continue with . </s>
I do not agree . </s>
that system have prove itself to be inappropriate because it be , in actual fact , of use only to relatively few of the @card@ country concerned . </s>
it operate too slowly , and it therefore stand to reason that the develop country should have say yes to the new system of the future , because this will operate more flexibly . </s>
regard the future accession of country such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention , I can only repeat what I recently say to the European Parliament 's Committee on Development and Cooperation , namely , that the door be open . </s>
it be the applicant themselves who be to decide whether they want to knock on the door . </s>
once they have do so , we shall adopt a position on the matter . </s>
with regard to Cuba 's application for accession to the Lomé Convention , the Commission note that , accord to their recent declaration , the ACP state support Cuba 's application . </s>
the Eu have always call for a constructive attitude to be adopt towards Cuba , as outline in the Eu 's common position , but it have to be recognise that the discussion will be complex . </s>
with regard to the Côte d ' Ivoire , I can inform you that the whole of the EUR @card@ million have be pay back in accordance with what be agree follow examination of the financial irregularity . </s>
with regard to finance the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget , I can say that this be be consider . </s>
for its part , the Commission support this , but we can at this point produce new report on the why and wherefore . </s>
concern Article 366A , I can say that , during the negotiation for a new partnership agreement , a new procedure be establish for deal with instance where human right and the principle of democracy and the rule of law be infringe . </s>
it be now the case , follow adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty , that Parliament wish , on the basis of Article @card@ , to be keep fully inform of all decision , and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament 's decision on this subject . </s>
There be no plan to follow the procedure involve concurrent statement in Parliament in connection with such decision . </s>
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopt Amsterdam Treaty . </s>
finally , I would refer to the South Africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touch upon . </s>
in this regard , I be simply pleased - delighted , in fact - here this evening , as a conclusion to this debate , to be able , very appropriately , to inform you that South Africa 's President have today say yes to the solution which the Eu 's Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agree unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problem regard South Africa . </s>
so the &quot; Grappa War &quot; be over . </s>
peace have break out , and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dream and value which ought to have underpin the whole business from the start . </s>
I think this rather nicely put the finish touch to a debate which have , on the whole , be quite positive , and I would repeat my thank to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which have go into our relation with the Third World on precisely the work in question . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM the next item be the report ( A5-0031 / @card@ ) by Mr Swoboda , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorise the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM ( SEC ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0166 / @card@ @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ) . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , today we be discuss a country that really have suffer hard time , a country that be , however , move in a very promising direction , thank to its own effort and resolve and certainly also thank to the support of the international community . </s>
so if the European Union , the Council and the Commission be propose - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe , in the Balkan region - I be quite happy to use that term - it be primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself have work its way into a good position , in economic and , of course , mainly in political term , in face of the war in the neighbour region and also in relation to its own minority . </s>
for it be no small thing to have a minority of @card@ % or even @card@ % in one 's own country . </s>
that country and its politician - no doubt with some difference here and there - have always do very good work , and we should recognise that . </s>
the Commission be propose that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council . </s>
let me make a few comment on aspect on which view may differ somewhat , although , even in this regard , I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten 's activity and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole . </s>
firstly , there be the regional approach . </s>
I believe that if it be understand properly , the regional approach be both important and necessary . </s>
There have to be a willingness to cooperate . </s>
provide it be not see as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate , as an opportunity that each country should grasp , then this be the right approach . </s>
the problem be that , when we look at FYROM , we can see how very difficult it be to cooperate economically with some neighbour country , such as Kosovo and Albania , or to cooperate politically with , for instance , Yugoslavia . </s>
on the other hand , cooperation with Bulgaria , and in particular with Greece , have make good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too . </s>
in this context , the European Union must consider , as it begin to do early this week , how to include the neighbour Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything , i. e. without take back any of our criticism of this terrible regime . </s>
tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urge that we concentrate the sanction on the regime itself while ease them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation . </s>
in that regard allow me to say , since I come from a country through which the Danube flow , that I be grateful that the Commission , I. E. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio , with whom I be recently in Budapest , be consider open the Danube to ship again . </s>
that would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too , which , of course , would be of particular importance to Romania . </s>
in my view , this regional approach , provide it be understand correctly , i. e. as a method of contribute to economic recovery in the region itself , be in fact the right one to adopt . </s>
as I say , it must not be perceive as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition . </s>
secondly , let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union . </s>
in our view , it would be an illusion to think there be any point in FYROM apply for accession right now , but it would also be wrong to delay discuss it until some late date . </s>
FYROM want to be tell here and now that , in principle , accession will be possible when the time be right . </s>
this country be afraid it will be in a sense sideline . </s>
it see , in the whole readjustment of aid instrument , a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train head towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leave FYROM on a siding . </s>
I think Commissioner Patten understand that too . </s>
so I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talk . </s>
thirdly , I believe that , so far at least , FYROM have show that it be capable of use the various instrument properly . </s>
even though there will of course be readjustment here , FYROM will continue to show that many of the task that be still be deal with in Brussels today can in future be handle in Skopje , in the country itself . </s>
I hope that the honourable member will agree to support these proposal as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM . </s>
Mr President , since the start of the Yugoslav war , the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - have behave as a constructive peace-keeper . </s>
we would remind you of the proposal make by the government of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time , which have non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view . </s>
as you can see , our Macedonian friend have always play a very positive role and it be for this reason that it should be point out at this stage that Macedonia be not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability , but actually take the initiative . </s>
the former President , Mr Gligorov , can take special credit for this , and the current President too have already adopt the profile of President of all Macedonian citizen , so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans . </s>
despite the obvious reason for any internal tension , both population group have strike a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reach a sound solution to the remain problem be good . </s>
it be , in fact , in Macedonia that I hear at the time about the Roma population actually not have too bad a time there . </s>
I be unaccustomed to hear this type of comment about the Roma in Europe . </s>
with regard to the problem afflict Macedonia , high education for the Albanian-speaking citizen deserve our special attention . </s>
accessible high education , with which you have a certain affinity , be an important instrument in the emancipation of population group . </s>
I be speak from personal experience as someone who attend the Protestant university in Amsterdam . </s>
I might never have study otherwise . </s>
such an affinity and this type of high education be also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly term mainstream society which need to be strengthen in country like this . </s>
the agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incur follow the boycott we institute against Serbia , which be at no cost to us but cost Serbia 's neighbour state all the more . </s>
it would be beneficial if we could reorganise this , especially vis-à-vis the neighbour state . </s>
it be only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now . </s>
we be therefore quite prepare to support the liberal ' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor state ' interest , for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the well possible opportunity with the aid money available for reconstruction . </s>
I be more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this , as it seem to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five country of former Yugoslavia , plus Albania . </s>
it be important to us that the economy in the region can stand on their own two foot again , which can quite easily be do with the aid money . </s>
the agreement with Macedonia should be see as a door opening to the European Union , allow this country to join , even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future . </s>
in the meantime , we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it be desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States , and our policy should reflect this , even in the naming of aid programme for Macedonia . </s>
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example . </s>
Mr President , the name of the republic be still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivity surround it . </s>
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly free to use the name in their own language which fit the republic . </s>
if certain country wish to use the word &quot; former Yugoslavia &quot; , then that be their business ; other need not feel oblige to copy them . </s>
it will not do to keep us under constant pressure . </s>
hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda ; we have come to expect nothing less of him , and hence also my word of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia . </s>
Mr President , let me begin by express my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda 's work as rapporteur . </s>
today we be express a positive opinion on the opening of negotiation for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia . </s>
we do so in the awareness that this decision , the very first relate to that area , be actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relation with the Balkans . </s>
this new phase , or rather policy , identify the prospect of integrate the region into Europe as the only option for settle its conflict peacefully . </s>
our agreement to the negotiation , as set out in the rapporteur 's explanatory statement , be bear of the conviction that it be right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of effort make and result achieve by individual country in move towards the acquis communautaire . </s>
this be the dual objective which I believe should be pursue . </s>
on the one hand , we must maintain programme on , for example , infrastructure , preparation - still premature - for free trade , and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the country in the area , and on the other , it be now appropriate to create a model of close integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy . </s>
and there be several reason why our opinion can only be positive . </s>
as we be able to ascertain during our mission to Skopje , there have be considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , as regard the economy , movement towards democracy and - an area which be difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence . </s>
on the other hand , the price Macedonia have be pay for the war in neighbour Kosovo be very high , both in term of logistic availability of NATO force and in term of reduce export to Northern Europe . </s>
I conclude , Mr President , by affirm that this progress be indeed difficult , fragile , and uncertain and it call for constant vigilance on our part during the various stage of close and precise inspection that have long be advocate . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party welcome the start of negotiation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . </s>
we be extremely hopeful that , along the line set out by the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extend to the other country , especially Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Montenegro and Kosovo and , as soon as possible , Serbia . </s>
we be convince a rapid start to these negotiation and their speedy conclusion be the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which do not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoid the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence , with all the consequence of that in term of continental , if not world , instability . </s>
if the maintenance of peace and security be the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the country of Eastern Europe , that motivation must be present even more strongly in relation with Albania and the country of former Yugoslavia . </s>
and that mean decisively pursue the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreement we be discuss represent . </s>
it be in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have present an amendment suggest the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to enlargement . </s>
very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institution have also lead us to suggest that a limited number of observer invite from the national parliament should be accept into the European Parliament , and that staff from those country could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission . </s>
but if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy be to be encourage , we be convince that immediate and concrete step must be take to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development . </s>
with this in mind , we have present some amendment which I hope Parliament will accept . </s>
first , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offer a custom tariff equal to zero for their export to the European union and compensation for the progressive reduction of custom duty apply by Macedonia to European product , on condition that the principle of joint custom control at the frontier of Macedonia be accept . </s>
secondly , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encourage , with adequate financial support , to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy , with the additional aim of eliminate any possible corruption in the banking system . </s>
thirdly , world aid and assistance come into the region , and hence into Macedonia as well , should be clearly multilateral , and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligation towards the donor country . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , we hope the agreement can achieve all its objective but we can delude ourselves that peace , stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieve without deal with the very wide-ranging problem we be try to eliminate . </s>
I be refer to the future constitutional state of Kosovo , the need to involve Serbia in the region 's reconciliation process and - why not ? </s>
- new discussion on relation between the European Union , NATO and the UN , in the light of the new balance that need to be find between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty , which I think call for a change in the exist UN Charter . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the war in Kosovo have knock everything off balance . </s>
this be certainly true for the relation between the European Union and the western Balkans . </s>
since then , expectation have be high . </s>
this apply to them and us . </s>
this be true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they be ask us for direct aid and they be wonder what Europe want from them at the end of the day ? </s>
be there any prospect of membership ? </s>
this be very much on their mind . </s>
but here too , within the European Union , expectation be high . </s>
if we do thing properly , this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy . </s>
Will the Union manage to display a unite front and develop a common policy , for the first time , concern such a difficult regulation ? </s>
it also remain to be see whether the European Union have learn any lesson from the bad experience in Bosnia when it come to provide aid and the slightly good experience in Kosovo . </s>
Can we , base on the experience in Macedonia and in four other country , improve on this ? </s>
against this background of extremely high expectation , I do not think that I be exaggerate if I say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia , be vitally important . </s>
this be not the Union 's only contribution . </s>
the debate on the Stability Pact , the debate on the Cara programme and the financing arrangement in the short term be all pend . </s>
we be now deal with the stabilisation and association agreement , that be to say a medium-term issue . </s>
this be why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia be so crucial , because it serve as a model . </s>
I be convince that the four other country be wonder what be go to happen . </s>
What do the European Union intend to do with Macedonia ? </s>
Will it do the same to us ? </s>
this first step be so important because of this model function . </s>
Macedonia also serve as a model for another reason . </s>
the rapporteur have already hint at this in no uncertain term , namely , the issue of interethnic relation . </s>
There be no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture . </s>
during the presidential election , it appear that thing be not run too smoothly , but compare to the rest of the region , Macedonia could serve as a model . </s>
we would gain a great deal if we manage to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonian . </s>
this model function also apply to regional cooperation . </s>
I could not agree more with the rapporteur : a balance must be strike between promote regional cooperation on the one hand and maintain the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece , and not cut them off on the other . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , if we manage this first step successfully , we will have gain a great deal . </s>
if we mess it up , then we will have lose a great deal more . </s>
Mr President , let me begin by say that I have no problem with approve this very sound report in principle . </s>
I just want to point to one issue which in my view be not consider in the report and which raise a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of Eu financial and other support . </s>
I be refer to the sanction against Yugoslavia . </s>
do not misunderstand me : I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime . </s>
but firstly , these sanction have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbour state too , include Macedonia , which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it be . </s>
secondly , the entire population of Yugoslavia be be hold accountable for the action of Milosevic and his circle , which be wrong on humanitarian ground and politically counterproductive . </s>
so I believe that we should take today 's debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanction , as state in Amendment No @card@ . </s>
Mr President , we do not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that , after various war in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , with their untold negative effect on the stability of the Balkans , a global and durable strategy for the whole region be need , aim at guarantee peace and stability in south-east Europe . </s>
this strategy , which take shape in the Stability Pact adopt on @card@ June @card@ in Cologne , consider south-east Europe as a whole , but simultaneously recognise the diversity and unequal development of the various country that compose the region . </s>
the European Union 's contribution under the Stability Pact , now convert into what be call the &quot; stabilisation and association process &quot; , represent a development in the regional concept the European Community draw up in @card@ for the five country of the region : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania . </s>
its most significant aspect be the establishment of political and economic condition intend to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement , and it should therefore contribute to regional stability . </s>
so establish relation between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis , and offer that country the prospect of full integration into the structure of the European union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process , constitute an important contribution to stability in the Balkans . </s>
the assumption be that the country be prepare to accept a certain set of condition . </s>
the expectation be that we send them a politically relevant signal that it be possible for them to join us one day , maintain respect for their sovereignty of course . </s>
we be not delude ourselves by believe that , once agreement be obtain , the mandate we be give the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region , where the people have already show they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development . </s>
they have suffer enough , first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they pay for be force to become part of the communist bloc . </s>
the evidence be that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be politically and economically capable of establish new contractual relation with the European Union , go beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June @card@ , which in practice target respect for the acquis communautaire , especially in key area of the internal market . </s>
it be true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still have a long way to go , but , give the political and economic reform already make in the context of the cooperation agreement , and with transitional period accept for certain domain , the country will be able to fulfil the condition for a stabilisation and association agreement . </s>
we share the view that its development be a factor for stability in the region , we approve the term of the negotiate mandate as propose , emphasise that what be involve be a bilateral agreement with the European Union , and we agree with the rapporteur when he stress that this be the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe , and that the issue be how the Balkans can be structure in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability . </s>
the various reference make to regional cooperation with the neighbour country in fact become politically relevant in this context . </s>
this agreement can and must become an example to the other country in the region . </s>
that be why it be so important . </s>
the point be that underlie this whole process be an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these country . </s>
we be aware that some of them be already undergo process of democratic stabilisation , that other still need to affirm the democratic authority of their government , and that equilibrium in other depend on the military presence in the zone , but they be all country which now know that , once they have overcome their difficulty , a bridge be available to provide an effective link with the European Union . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I be not go to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow member . </s>
I think this report be a small masterpiece of hypocrisy . </s>
paragraph 5 hold up this agreement as an example . </s>
we know there be @card@ applicant country , from Lithuania to Turkey , and just one black hole in Europe , the Balkans , but because these country be deny the opportunity to become applicant , we want to make them believe that this agreement be a miracle . </s>
paragraph @card@ indicate that symbolic measure can replace the shared political outlook represent by applicant status . </s>
but this be not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy , it be also an aberration , because , if negotiation begin tomorrow , this agreement will be sign in a year and will come into force in three year . </s>
and I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership application in due form from Croatia , Macedonia and Bosnia , amongst the Balkan country , three year hence . </s>
a few day ago Mr Racan announce that Croatia 's formal membership application would be present at the end of @card@ . </s>
There be bind to be other application and this great work , this fine intellectual architecture , will crumble , leave behind by event just as we have be leave behind by everything that have be happen in the former Yugoslavia for the past @card@ year . </s>
this would not be so serious if this region of Europe be not so beset by the problem we be all aware of , problem which be be address , but which have not yet be resolve , by the new government of Macedonia . </s>
There be the problem of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority , the connected problem of Kosovo , the notorious economic problem , the problem of be neighbour to a particularly develop mafia in Serbia , and then there be the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemn for what it be . </s>
after nearly @card@ year , Greece continue to prevent this country be call by its own name , and I hope the interpreter have not use the term FYROM when I have be say Macedonia . </s>
it be absolutely absurd . </s>
apart from anything else it be offensive , in my opinion , to the Greek MEPs and the citizen of Greece . </s>
this question need to be resolve urgently . </s>
finally , by happy chance , a letter from Mr Georgievski , President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler , date 8 March , have come into my hand . </s>
in it , refer to Article O , now Article @card@ of the Treaty , he ask if Macedonia can join the European Union . </s>
why have the Council not inform us of this ? </s>
why have the Commission not inform us of this formal request from Macedonia ? </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the Balkans be not purely a dark cave , politically speak . </s>
the decidedly positive development in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical year speak for themselves . </s>
the gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbour Kosovo do not reach its territory . </s>
paradoxically , but truly , the war in Kosovo Polje generate exactly the opposite effect : the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority become decidedly small . </s>
from the point of view of the Macedonian majority , the Albanian minority behave loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict . </s>
in the eye of the Albanian minority , the Macedonian and the Macedonian state have more than meet their neighbourly obligation in respect of Kosovo 's Albanian majority who be persecute to the extreme . </s>
this remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiation can therefore justifiably be see as the internal , political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round . </s>
Mr Swoboda 's well-balanced and laudable report fit in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level . </s>
in brief , the European Union know what to do in Macedonia : to help this local port of refuge - recently use by score of war refugee - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans . </s>
Mr President , as one who have be concern with Macedonia for eight year , I have to contradict Mr Dupuis . </s>
What we be do here be not hypocritical . </s>
we have reach a propitious moment and I think the Macedonian be glad about it . </s>
Please stop be so unpleasant and pour cold water on everything . </s>
I think we should take a more positive approach here . </s>
Macedonia do not go through a war . </s>
but it suffer from the war in its vicinity and from the sanction , as it be still suffer from the sanction that be rightly impose on the neighbour country . </s>
it suffer enormously from the influx of refugee during the Kosovo war . </s>
so we must admit that development in Macedonia have follow surprisingly continuous democratic line . </s>
this be a country that have difficult inter-ethnic problem to deal with at home , and be resolve them with increase success . </s>
let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minority and the way it apply it and that the consistent policy of integrate the @card@ % of ethnic Albanian in government activity , in government policy and in society , be a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia . </s>
I be glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda express in his report will be fulfill early in March , i. e. that we will finally have an Eu delegation there and that we , as the European Union , will finally have a great role to play there . </s>
I believe that the opening of these negotiation on the stability and association process be the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country . </s>
as a sign of our political commitment , we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we be indeed reward its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embark on regional project . </s>
let me name just two small one : the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier cross with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8 , from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria . </s>
I think Mr Swoboda have draft an excellent report , and it have my wholehearted support . </s>
Mr President , I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report . </s>
I think it be a good thing that so many of us be express support for the approach he have adopt in it . </s>
the report tackle stability in the region in a structural manner . </s>
this be also the purpose of the pend agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we be debate today . </s>
although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact have not yet start , the Commission have already develop the new instrument , entitle the Stabilisation and Association Agreement . </s>
this mark the beginning of the treaty-based stabilise process for the country of the former Yugoslavia . </s>
these country do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement . </s>
the present agreement be a kind of pre-pre-agreement , but with a view to join in future . </s>
the instrument of join country together by mean of active treaty be excellent , provide that the agreement stipulate in them be implement dynamically , so that the required stabilisation can actually be attain . </s>
Macedonia remain a potential minefield and have a history to match . </s>
it do , however , have the ambition to break free from this image . </s>
this require internal stability . </s>
the new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reform , include a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority . </s>
more than anything , the country need peace and quiet now , in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to great prosperity . </s>
we , the social democrat , would urge the opposition to back these idea . </s>
they need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model . </s>
but the country also - and especially - need external stability . </s>
What be the point of have internal stability if the surround environment be unstable ? </s>
this stability be require in the relation with Yugoslavia , Kosovo , Albania and Bulgaria . </s>
the region should recognise that Macedonia exist and that it will continue to exist . </s>
external stability also mean open border and regional cooperation . </s>
minority and majority need to be give room for human and cultural exchange . </s>
Macedonia 's stability be very much link with the development in the neighbour country . </s>
the Kosovo problem be well-known and the international community be present there on a massive scale . </s>
it seem that the Albania factor be be underestimate . </s>
the Union consider it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country . </s>
but what then instead ? </s>
it be the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern , so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania be really not acceptable . </s>
What do the Commission intend to do regard this issue ? </s>
Yugoslavia be just as much a weak link in the stability process and , as such , a threat to Macedonia 's stability . </s>
we need to wait and see what happen there . </s>
the mood in Belgrade be become less predictable by the day . </s>
we , however , second the Council 's decision to give the sanction a different focus . </s>
in this way , at least a serious attempt be be make to give the opposition , which be prepare for a new round of demonstration , a shot in the arm . </s>
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bring forward election - be meet ? </s>
What else can we do to support this opposition ? </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Kosovo be hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpret as say that dictator could persecute minority in the most repellent way on the ground that &quot; it be happen within their own nation &quot; . </s>
when the USA and NATO and , finally , also the Eu , react , it be already late , in fact very late . </s>
a great deal of suffering could have be avoid if the Eu , among other , have act earlier and more decisively . </s>
we , the European Union , therefore have a special responsibility to help , support and rebuild the Balkans now . </s>
our absolute objective must be to create the prior condition for all country in south-east Europe to be integrate with other country in the Eu - economically , politically and in term of trade . </s>
fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravage part of Europe be well provide through trade and economic integration . </s>
we liberal be prepare to go a long way and to do so quickly , just as Paolo Costa report . </s>
it be therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that be now be make for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia , and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report . </s>
Macedonia deserve our support , especially in view of the self-sacrificial , disinterested work which the people and leader of Macedonia undertake during the Kosovo war . </s>
now that Macedonia be prise itself loose from the crush embrace of communism and nationalism , it be our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain term . </s>
we should do exactly the same for the other country in the Balkans . </s>
this be an urgent duty for the Eu . </s>
Mr President , allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who be mainly responsible for war , human degradation , murder and drive innocent people from their home be still govern what remain of Yugoslavia , namely Serbia . </s>
the man who be accuse of genocide and who ought to be bring before the war crime tribunal in the Hague still go free . </s>
I be talk about Milosevic . </s>
as long as Milosevic be still there and Serbia be not pursue a democratic path , Serbia constitute a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans , include in Macedonia . </s>
Mr President , the agreement be promote will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe , its term , which the Swoboda report accept , be certainly not direct towards peace , but towards great political and economic dominance of the country , and towards control its natural wealth , overexploiting its workforce and continue to use that country as a springboard against the country and people in the area who be resist the new order . </s>
All this , in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union . </s>
the report accept these attitude along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe . </s>
it be characteristic that the report congratulate FYROM on the constructive stance it maintain during the NATO attack , eulogise its pacifist role because it allow its territory to be use as a base for NATO force , but , of course , remain silent about the indignation of its people , which be manifest by mass demonstration during the NATO bombardment . </s>
finally , because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union be implement in country in that area , will create new problem there , new tribulation for their people , and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialist , we will be vote against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , one of the most basic aim of the European Union 's stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be to establish stability and peace in the area , and this , of course , presuppose develop and maintain good neighbourly relation between the country involve . </s>
I shall not bother you with detail of the problem concern the name FYROM , which as you must know , be the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiation between the two country lasting over four year , under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolution , but also the conventional obligation of the respective party pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of @card@ . </s>
I do , however , think it appropriate to say that , at the forthcoming negotiation and with the conclusion of the association agreement , the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will , so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talk in New York . </s>
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe , with parallel emphasis on the difficulty that any further indecision would create for complete and implement the association agreement , would be duly heed and appraise accordingly by the Skopje government , so that it can respond appropriately , on the one hand , to Greece 's demonstrably conciliatory attitude concern the specific issue , and , on the other hand , to the more general practical , declare intention and disposition of all the partner in the European Union , include Greece , to facilitate and support FYROM 's progress towards a United Europe . </s>
Mr President , this be because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relation , contact and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually be achieve at both bipartite and multipartite level , and this mainly thank to the practical arrangement of the intermediate agreement , I repeat , I do not think these sufficiently cover the condition and criterion of good neighbourliness necessary , inter alia , for negotiate and conclude an association agreement . </s>
on the contrary , I think that this demand can only be consider satisfy by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM 's relation with all its neighbour . </s>
that , combine with the essential improvement of certain aspect of the internal situation in that country , in the area of minority and democratic institution , would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM have , in fact , present in other respect and which have make our European family welcome close relation with it . </s>
Mr President , the agreement we be debate today , as analyse by Mr Swoboda , which I hope we will adopt tomorrow , constitute the second politically positive step , after the stability pact for the area . </s>
There be another small step , which be relate to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decide by our @card@ government for Yugoslavia . </s>
for about @card@ year , the situation in the area have be fluid . </s>
both as an historical period and , in particular , as a political period , @card@ year be a very long time . </s>
under those condition , then , there have be a real failure . </s>
in that sense , the agreement we will be vote on tomorrow , which contribute towards stability in the area , be de facto a move in the right direction . </s>
in essence , FYROM be a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia , regardless of where one or another minority hold supremacy . </s>
from that standpoint , the fact that so far it have resist any influence from its wide environment be a very positive element and under no circumstance should any of us , any State , any policy or any view , impel that small republic towards external , disruptive movement in an effort to solve other problem , grant - let it be note - that it have institution which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy . </s>
in that area , there have be various policy from time to time , and what the European Union should guard against be the risk that , for ultimately superficial reason , it may help to create banana republic elsewhere . </s>
we must be sure that , in seek ally in the area , we must not always choose anyone who offer . </s>
we must choose those which be moderate , which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area . </s>
I hope and wish , and be indeed certain , that the European Union , with maturity and with the measure it have begin to adopt , will little by little construct , in the wide area , the necessary environment which it need itself . </s>
let us not deceive ourselves : a Europe , one part of which be be hold back because of friction , misinterpretation and conflict , and because of nationalistic clash , will never be a Europe that have bring its own house to the level it want . </s>
in any event , speak now as a Greek , I want to tell some of the speaker I listen to earlier that much of what be say be fixate on other time and place . </s>
they have quite fail to grasp the new condition create in the area ; the new and positive condition which have be create , in very many case on Greece 's initiative . </s>
you should know that the country which cooperate most with FYROM and have the good relation with it , in the entire area , be Greece , and this have contribute greatly to the stability of the area . </s>
I say this just so that we know where we stand . </s>
Mr President , I find what Mr Souladakis say much more sensible than the statement by other colleague from his Member State . </s>
so I must say quite plainly that anyone who try to tie the agreement with Macedonia to resolve the issue of the country 's name , as he do , will not only find Macedonia itself against him but all the other Eu Member States too . </s>
let me also say quite openly that he be thereby do huge damage to his own country 's interest . </s>
it be in our interest to see stability and peace in the Balkans , and there be a chance of that , although the Stability Pact be in danger of become a stillborn entity . </s>
I hope that be not the case , but the risk be there . </s>
that be precisely why it be so urgent for the Eu to take a bilateral approach to the individual state and for us to open up definite prospect of Eu membership for Macedonia . </s>
so I welcome Mr Swoboda 's excellent report , especially paragraph @card@ , which quite clearly map out a European , an Eu , prospect for Macedonia . </s>
without indulge in any illusion , I believe that be important , it have to happen . </s>
we know it can happen overnight , but a definite statement to the effect that Macedonia be quite clearly a European country and therefore have the right to be a member of the European Union be a most important , confidence-building measure . </s>
in my view , this be a unique opportunity to strengthen a democracy that have not only establish a unique multi-ethnic government in this region but be also strengthen the autonomy of the local authority , reform the judicial and economic system , and do so under the most difficult condition , in the aftermath of nationalism , communism and war . </s>
a few year ago , I have the privilege of invite the current President and Prime Minister here as private individual . </s>
at the time they be still find it very difficult to build on their various contact here . </s>
I be very happy to see they have keep the promise they make at the time : to build up a profoundly European democracy . </s>
we must thank them for play this important role in move towards peace , stability and democracy , at a very critical time last year , as I say , and at a strategically crucial point . </s>
so we be not just the donor here , we be also the recipient , and we owe it to the Macedonian to thank them for fulfill a crucial European mission at that time . </s>
that be why it be important to negotiate and ratify the agreement promptly , rapidly to upgrade the Eu representation to official delegation status , for our Commissioner to visit Macedonia very soon , as I hear he will , and for us to open up a definite prospect of Eu membership for this country , as the Swoboda report do . </s>
. </s>
this have be a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole . </s>
it be none the bad for that , but perhaps I will be forgive for concentrate very largely on the report because there be some extremely important issue that I want to touch on . </s>
I be delight to be able to be able to set out the Commission 's position on the report . </s>
it be very helpful . </s>
it be an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleague . </s>
we be very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleague , a number of whom be in the House this evening - Mrs Pack , Mr Lagendijk and other . </s>
I be very please that at our overall relation with FYROM be in such a good state . </s>
perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for use that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale . </s>
that have be help by our excellent European Union representative in the country . </s>
he have be a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission . </s>
the imminent commencement of negotiation on a stabilisation and association agreement be the most powerful example of our good relation . </s>
so to be the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo . </s>
I be grateful to the authority in Macedonia for their assistance in recent week in help to cope with the considerable difficulty with the power supply in Kosovo . </s>
like honourable member I recognise the stabilise role that this country have play during the Balkan tragedy , in particular when it come to integrate the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country . </s>
I see the newly-elected President Georgievski a few week ago and I be extremely impress , as other have be , by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism . </s>
let me set out where matter now stand on these negotiation to which - as Mr Lagendijk say - other country in the region be look with very considerable interest . </s>
the Council adopt on @card@ January this year its negotiate directive for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia . </s>
this represent the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiate by the Commission in May @card@ . </s>
let me make clear the main element of those draft directive . </s>
they cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangement establish a political dialogue with FYROM . </s>
they cover provision for enhanced regional cooperation include the prospect of establish free trade area between the country of the region , though I must make it clear that there be no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia . </s>
they cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten year of the entry into force of the agreement . </s>
they cover provision on the movement of worker , freedom of establishment , supply of service , current payment and movement of capital . </s>
they cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community , notably in key area of the internal market ; and they cover provision on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of field , include justice and home affair . </s>
we be now make in the Commission the necessary preparation so that negotiation can start in March . </s>
I be due to visit FYROM in the second week in March . </s>
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then , although the formal negotiation will start very shortly thereafter . </s>
at the time of that visit I will also , as recommend by honourable member and other , be upgrade our representation in FYROM . </s>
the target date for conclude the negotiation be December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiator . </s>
the agreement could enter into force in three to four year from now , give the time need for ratification in Member States ' parliament . </s>
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other point in the draft resolution . </s>
we accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreement , although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we be deal with different country , each of which have its own identity and its own concern . </s>
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merit and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slow in the development of relation with the Union . </s>
that have never be the intention . </s>
the very fact that negotiation be begin first with FYROM , before all the other , be evidence that we can and do differentiate . </s>
on the provision of regional aid refer to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to project have a cross-border or regional dimension . </s>
we agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of Eu membership contain in the stabilisation and association agreement . </s>
it will reflect the European Union 's position on its relation with the country of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusion . </s>
we strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programme to the maximum possible extent . </s>
as for the arrangement cover European Union assistance to the western Balkans , member will be aware that we be draw up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation . </s>
I be aware that there be concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the Phare programme in these country and , especially , at the loss of association with the Phare name . </s>
I note with considerable concern what member say on this score . </s>
I will take another look at the issue , although I should point out that have two PHARE programme up and run risk real confusion . </s>
I want to stress , however , that whatever the programme be call , our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbour into the European family be strong than ever . </s>
in general I trust that member of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia have reach this stage relatively rapidly . </s>
I hope that the other country of the region will redouble their effort to make similar progress . </s>
I look forward to many similar debate to this over the next few year mark , I hope , the success of what we be try to do in the Balkans which , for me , remain the single most important litmus-test of what Europe be able to do on its own doorstep . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Patten . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. agreement on comitology the next item be the report ( A5-0021 / @card@ ) by Mrs Frassoni , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of @card@ June @card@ on comitology ( @card@ / @card@ / EC ) . </s>
. </s>
( it ) Mr President , the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedure for implement the Council decision on comitology mark the end of a saga which have keep Parliament busy for two year , along with a few enthusiast scatter among the various institution of the Union , whom many people do not hesitate to call masochist . </s>
until @card@ , the way the Commission exercise its executive power , and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangement , be create conflict and mistrust between the institution , and threaten to have serious consequence on the legislative procedure . </s>
that be why , in accordance with Declaration No @card@ , annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Union institution have undertake a complex task of negotiation and consultation , result in the new Council decision , which revise the old system quite substantially , although we be not entirely satisfy with it . </s>
in particular , the decision outline a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implement measure , derive from an act adopt under the codecision procedure , overstep the implement power delegate to the Commission . </s>
during the protracted interinstitutional negotiation - which see Parliament actively involve , thank to the work of the rapporteur , Adelaide Aglietta - it be understand that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedure for implement certain aspect of the new decision . </s>
on the one hand , certain point which the Council do not intend to incorporate into the decision be to be make explicit and , on the other , the system for provide information about implement measure and monitor them be to be organise more precisely . </s>
during the trialogue hold on 6 October @card@ in Strasbourg , the president of the European Parliament and the Commission approve the idea of conclude this agreement soon . </s>
we believe we have respect that commitment , and indeed this be make relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiation with the Commission . </s>
essentially , the agreement deal with two point : one be the right of the European Parliament to be inform , which be the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision . </s>
hitherto , such information have be supply on paper and unsystematically , and be of no use to our service ; and indeed this be often the fault of Parliament itself . </s>
from now on , the information will be provide by mean of an electronic system call CIRCA , to which the European Parliament will have access . </s>
this represent a real innovation , not only for us , but also - I be sure - for the Commission . </s>
the other point be that Article 8 of the Council decision do not specify either the method by which the European Parliament be to sound the alarm , or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control . </s>
paragraph 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that , as a general rule , the European Parliament will adopt its resolution , state its reason , at a plenary sit and have one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopt the draft implement measure . </s>
but we all realise that it be not always possible to wait a month before implement a measure . </s>
therefore , the agreement contain explicit provision on urgent procedure , include possible action by the committee responsible . </s>
I want to end by stress that we can assess whether this be a good agreement or not , we must wait and see how it work in practice . </s>
the European Parliament need to acquire the resource , which it currently lack , to ensure efficient monitoring of implement measure , and the Commission must accept that some of its practice need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective . </s>
finally , it need to be bear in mind that - whatever happen - the real solution to the problem of comitology for the European Parliament be still to change the procedure for implement legislation lay down in the treaty , and gradually to dismantle the committee whose existence represent an anomaly that severely restrict the Commission 's executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament 's legislative power . </s>
Mr President , comitology be a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone know what it mean . </s>
it make them think of secret society and conspiracy , which be the way thing use to be . </s>
in fact , it imply nothing other than fix the procedure for the exercise of the implement power confer on the Commission . </s>
the procedure for exercise these implement power take the form of a limited number of committee procedure . </s>
up until the Amsterdam Treaty , there be about @card@ variation of these committee procedure , which create neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizen . </s>
on the contrary , for a long time even the European Parliament be not inform . </s>
for the European Parliament , the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committee be to be inform , at least , of all that the European Commission intend to regulate in the context of these various committee . </s>
agreement be reach in @card@ in the form of an exchange of letter between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors . </s>
a further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament come with what be know as the modus vivendi of @card@ September @card@ , which grant Parliament the right not only to be inform but also to intervene in certain case . </s>
it also give it the possibility of scrutiny . </s>
with the Amsterdam Treaty , the situation improve decidedly when the number of committee procedure be drastically reduce - as the European Parliament have long want - to three procedure , the administrative procedure , the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure . </s>
now , follow the Amsterdam Treaty , the right of information and control grant to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrine anew in an interinstitutional agreement . </s>
Mrs Frassoni , our rapporteur , have do very careful work and identify the question that have to be clarify in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedure that may have to be change within Parliament . </s>
a key problem be the time factor . </s>
when the European Parliament be inform , it generally have to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four week , should it so wish . </s>
in matter relate to the health and safety of the people of the European Union , the European Commission , as guardian of the treaty and the only institution with the right of initiative , must be in a position to react very rapidly , if necessary within a few hour or day . </s>
nevertheless , the European Parliament must retain the right to be inform and where appropriate also to react . </s>
our rapporteur identify very useful solution to these difficulty , which I and my group can only support in full . </s>
I just have one more request . </s>
in the German version , paragraph 2 of the resolution have be translate rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification , which I would also like to see in the print version later . </s>
in my view , instead of &quot; weitergeführt Werden müssen &quot; the wording should be &quot; erhalten bleiben müssen &quot; . </s>
the German version be not very clear here . </s>
I would ask for that to be check again . </s>
for the rest , I warmly thank our rapporteur . </s>
it be a difficult subject and I hope we have manage to make it somewhat easy to deal with now . </s>
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her report . </s>
I must add that it be a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromise with the other institution . </s>
when it come to the IGC , she be one of what the French call &quot; les pures et dures &quot; : no compromise , no deal with the other institution ; we would rather see the whole thing block than compromise our position . </s>
yet here she be willing to accept the step forward that have be achieve , which be far from match Parliament 's original position on the issue of comitology . </s>
let us remember what be at stake here . </s>
Parliament have four main criticism of the comitology system as it exist prior to the new Council decision supplement by this interinstitutional agreement . </s>
firstly , the whole system be obscure . </s>
it be not transparent with hundred of committee meet with secret agenda and nobody know who be on the committee . </s>
here be a real step forward , in the new system that have be agree . </s>
we be to know who be on each committee . </s>
we be to know when they meet . </s>
we be to get the agenda . </s>
we be to get the document that be send to them . </s>
the whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex . </s>
so that be at least a step forward . </s>
our second criticism be that the system be very restrictive of the Commission . </s>
we adopt legislation in the European Union . </s>
we expect the Commission to implement it . </s>
and then we have a system design to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what be call the &quot; contre-filet &quot; system , under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council be not capable of find an alternative to the implement measure concern . </s>
here too there be at least some progress . </s>
the Council will no longer be able to block implement measure indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it have a qualified majority to block it , in other word , unless there be substantial opposition among the Member States represent in the Council . </s>
that be a more reasonable system . </s>
that , too , be a step forward . </s>
but on our other two criticism , we be less satisfied . </s>
the first criticism be of the system whereby the Commission be monitor , scrutinise , control if you like , only by a committee appoint by Member States or the Council not by Parliament . </s>
the legislative authority , Council and Parliament , should be equal . </s>
we confer implement power on the Commission , but then it be only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implement measure . </s>
Parliament have no equivalent power . </s>
True , we be now give the beginning of such a power in this new system . </s>
we be to receive all the draft implement measure forward to a committee at the same time as it be send to the committee . </s>
we will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question . </s>
but we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it have go beyond the delegation that we have give to the Commission in the legislation . </s>
in other word , we can challenge the measure for be ultra-vires but not on its content . </s>
and in a democracy , Parliament should be able to challenge the content . </s>
not that we do so every week . </s>
we be not seek to immerse ourselves in implement decision , but it be a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasion when it really would be necessary . </s>
that be lack in this new system , or at least be only there in embryonic form . </s>
finally , our fourth criticism be that if an implement measure be block through the comitology system it be refer back , not to both branch of the legislative authority , but to the council alone , which have the right possibly to take an alternative measure . </s>
that be not correct . </s>
both branch adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confer implement power on the Commission . </s>
if such implement measure be refer back , it should be to both branch , not to one branch alone . </s>
overall we have a system which have make some progress . </s>
the supplementary aspect that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission be welcome , but that could not change the basic decision of the Council . </s>
even here , we have renounce voluntarily - because this do not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise . </s>
we have be willing to relinquish the provision in that . </s>
we shall have to be very vigilant on what use to be cover by that agreement and be not fully cover by the new decision . </s>
we must be very vigilant . </s>
so it be a step forward . </s>
my group reluctantly accept it as a step forward . </s>
we be not as enthusiastic about compromise as Mrs Frassoni . </s>
we recognise that there be limitation and the issue will no doubt come back in a few year ' time . </s>
if we want a union that be democratic and transparent to the full degree we will have to revisit this subject . </s>
Mr President , first I want to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Frassoni , for her work . </s>
it be never easy working on comitology . </s>
Mrs Schleicher refer to a kind of committee magic , something we have long talk about . </s>
certainly the process have always be very complex , as a result of historical decision , and these must eventually be rationalise . </s>
in my opinion , the agreement reach between Commission and Parliament be a clear rationalisation of the process . </s>
from our point of view , it satisfy the fundamental interest of Parliament . </s>
Mr Corbett set out Parliament 's concern . </s>
he say some of them have be satisfy and other have not . </s>
I would say the one the Commission be able to satisfy have be satisfy . </s>
Mr Corbett be raise issue the Council decision do not cover , and unfortunately we can go no further on those . </s>
so how far have we come ? </s>
There be no doubt that we have reach a fundamental point , highlight by Mrs Frassoni , give that we now have an automatic information system . </s>
this will facilitate two activity Parliament be especially interested in . </s>
one be know how the committee operate , about their composition , agenda , description , and so on , and the other be the right of scrutiny over actual decision . </s>
I think this be a good agreement . </s>
it be a good agreement which undoubtedly improve the transparency of the process . </s>
from here on thing be go to be easy . </s>
but the agreement we be reach today should not be regard as a backward step compare with the Plumb / Delors Agreement . </s>
Mr Corbett refer to that , but the new model be certainly much more complex , different because the situation be now different , and , in our opinion , much more coherent . </s>
we have make a start , and we hope the work will produce some excellent result . </s>
we think there be other positive advance too . </s>
To a certain extent we have go beyond agreement which be already date and , by realign old procedure with the new situation , we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past . </s>
from the Commission 's point of view , our conclusion be that this be a good agreement , and we want to thank the member of Parliament who work on it - especially Mrs Frassoni . </s>
we hope that this new climate mean we have achieve the result we be seek , which be great transparency and good information about the decision of the Commission as an executive . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. M. Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure the next item be the report ( A5-0013 / @card@ ) by Mr Knörr Borràs , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on a proposal for a Council regulation amend Regulation ( EC ) No @card@ / @card@ on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annex to the Treaty establish the European Community ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0174 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) Mr President , I be also please to welcome the Spanish Commissioner , Mr Solbes Mira , whom I have congratulate more than once , inside and outside this Parliament , on the excellent work he do in Spain on the subject of European convergence . </s>
the proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure , annex to the Treaty of Maastricht , raise fundamental issue concern the switch to the @card@ European system of account , which , as you know , replace the previous system of account adopt in @card@ , and in particular the emergence of new financial product category , consistency in the calculation of the ratio of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA @card@ and , finally , recognise the importance of calculate interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology . </s>
in our view , the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation be to update the definition and the assessment of some of the economic operation involve in the calculation of deficit , as reflect in the Treaty establish the European Community , the Treaty of Maastricht , which lay down the maximum percentage which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market price in the various Member States . </s>
To date , the Member States have calculate this GDP in accordance with the criterion lay down in ESA @card@ . </s>
the most recent estimate of the deficit be submit in September @card@ and it relate to the @card@ financial year . </s>
therefore , if the regulation be adopt , the estimate which be due to appear in March @card@ , the first estimate of the deficit for the @card@ accounting year , will be make use the new system . </s>
we know the Member States have do their duty - if I can use that expression - do their calculation and prepare their national account in line with ESA @card@ , and they have already publish their corresponding estimate . </s>
in addition to incorporate a new methodology , this have mean make slight change to most accounting aggregate and operation , on account of the aforesaid methodological change , and also the improve statistical information include in the estimate . </s>
these change may of course alter the government deficit in term of the Member States ' national accounting . </s>
I will now describe , very briefly , the five area where the most important change may occur . </s>
first , the adjustment to the scope of what be mean by ' government institutional sector ' under ESA @card@ . </s>
this be important , since government deficit mean the deficit accumulate by all form of government . </s>
the non-availability of precise criterion for the definition of government deficit would produce distortion in the estimate of the Member States ' government deficit . </s>
secondly , the deficit - or , if applicable , the surplus - mean the ESA @card@ government sector 's net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively Thirdly , government investment mean the gross fix capital formation of the general government sector , as define in ESA @card@ . </s>
fourthly , government debt be define in accordance with ESA @card@ , as be the flow or interest stem from asset / liability . </s>
fifthly and finally , the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market price , estimate in accordance with the @card@ European System of Accounts ' definition . </s>
To summarise , I consider that this proposal constitute a satisfactory adaptation of the criterion lay down in the @card@ European System of Accounts , and I therefore approve it in full , as do the committee . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , let me say at the outset that my group welcome this proposal because it make the basic statistical datum for an economic and monetary union direct at stability and real growth more harmonise , directly comparable and more accurate . </s>
we have already hear about the various aspect involve . </s>
What I think be crucial be that henceforth the statistical datum will be more reliable and comparable . </s>
we need that because the various European Union body and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another . </s>
it be important to adjust the procedure for two reason . </s>
firstly , for the single market . </s>
it be most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable datum and statistic so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trend . </s>
secondly , for economic and monetary union . </s>
the regulation date from @card@ on the application of the Protocol must be bring into harmony with the methodology of the European system of account at national and regional level . </s>
that be vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficit . </s>
this adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficit and debt in the Member States more precisely . </s>
these technical change will have a very real impact on the actual position of the country , since the datum will automatically be amend in line with the public deficit . </s>
I also welcome the fact that the estimate of the deficit for the @card@ financial year that be due to be publish in March @card@ be already base on the new ESA , I. E. the analysis be base on consolidated aggregate that be economically relevant . </s>
let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the government and political party to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never have to be initiate for an excessive deficit . </s>
it be good that the procedure exist . </s>
we need it because it lend our criterion the necessary seriousness and credibility . </s>
the citizen ask what happen if the criterion be not meet . </s>
Thank to these procedure and other measure we can prove that we be take the criterion and ourselves seriously . </s>
another important point be that we must do all we can , not just to prevent excessive deficit , but also to further reduce public deficit . </s>
I know what I be talk about and I will conclude by tell you why I be so glad we be hold this debate ! </s>
we be currently hold a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually give us accurate information on the deficit . </s>
in my country , Austria , new election have to be hold in @card@ in order to meet the Maastricht criterion and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach . </s>
I must also tell you that in the year @card@ , when there be so much talk about us , the coalition talk with the SPÖ fail - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party bring down the negotiate austerity and consolidation programme . </s>
that be a prime reason why the new government have to be form in Austria ; for the Austrian People 's Party , the ÖVP , want to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability . </s>
the ÖVP want to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criterion and reduce the public deficit , as we have agree here . </s>
Mr President , the beauty of statistical datum be that it be not only reliable but also comparable . </s>
this be of great importance , especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market . </s>
this be why this report be also so politically charge : a report , by the way , on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly . </s>
it also inspire a few political comment . </s>
the Stability Pact be a give in Europe . </s>
all country participate in the euro have commit themselves , in the medium term , to strive towards a budget which be either balanced or show up a slight surplus . </s>
this , of course , do not mean that , if the economic climate be less than favourable , the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly . </s>
it mean that , in the long and medium term , there should be a balance or surplus . </s>
the strong the position of the participate country , the strong the euro will be . </s>
as a result , the three percent standard will rarely be exceed , not even in a bad economic climate . </s>
this be the theory behind it , anyway . </s>
we have always be of the opinion that these criterion should be stringently meet . </s>
that be of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success , now and in the future . </s>
strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States . </s>
various Member States have take one-off measure to be able to meet the criterion . </s>
we be of the opinion that the Member States ' budget policy should be strictly supervise , to ensure that the measure continue to be take in the spirit of the prescribe criterion at all time . </s>
a drop in standard should not be allow . </s>
we be also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reduce the national debt should be prioritised . </s>
indeed , we still have not manage to stop pass on the burden to future generation . </s>
. </s>
( ES ) Mr President , many thank , first of all , to the rapporteur for his splendid work . </s>
it be a subject which call for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr have handle it with great precision and professionalism . </s>
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal well than he have do ; I would just like to add one small point : in addition to adaptation to ESA @card@ , there be two small technical change which Mr Knörr know all about , relate to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency . </s>
I just mention that to complete the view of the process . </s>
secondly , I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness . </s>
he have do really good work in a very short time . </s>
this be an important subject for certain reference which we have hear subsequently . </s>
What we be seek with this legislation be not to make the statistic reliable and comparable - they already be - but to make them more reliable and more comparable . </s>
obviously , the fact that Parliament have take its decision so quickly will mean that the March figure can already be calculate on the basis of these new criterion . </s>
that be so , I believe the final result will be good . </s>
the figure will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concern some member have raise about compliance with the stability pact can be well address . </s>
this regulation be purely instrumental . </s>
it do deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raise . </s>
but we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem . </s>
the stability pact be in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitor compliance by the various Member States , despite the fact that the result be clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analyse the position as regard the stability of the government deficit . </s>
but we see no reason to lower our guard . </s>
we must press on in that direction because we know it be vital . </s>
so , once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allow us to measure stability with great technical certainty and good comparability . </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. increase penal sanction against counterfeit of the euro the next item be the report ( A5-0020 / @card@ ) by Mrs Cederschiöld , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs , on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increase protection by penal sanction against counterfeit in connection with the introduction of the euro ( @card@ / @card@ - C5-0332 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , lady and gentleman ( all the more welcome for be so few in number ) , one might have think that it be an unimportant subject which be to be discuss at this hour , but that be not the case . </s>
it be a definite and concrete issue . </s>
it be about our common currency . </s>
How many people here know that this currency be be counterfeit and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affair ? </s>
we can permit our common currency to become weak through its be counterfeit . </s>
the ECB , ECOFIN , Europol , Olaf and the Commissioner responsible for legal question have therefore realise that common countermeasure must be take quickly in order to close the loophole leave by the legislation . </s>
it be easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currency for twenty year after the new currency have be introduce . </s>
it be therefore important to include these currency too in the section of the present programme of measure which deal with penal sanction . </s>
this be something which Parliament have say it want to see add . </s>
the Council ought to have give Parliament the stipulate three-month period within which to consider , too , the last document produce on this matter , but we be all aware of how urgent it be to have these measure put safely in place . </s>
because the issue be to be decide upon in March in the Council , Parliament have cause to adopt a position on the proposal now , so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament 's point of view in the decision which have to be make in March . </s>
any country which begin to make difficulty would incur a responsibility for the currency , and that country would be accountable , both morally and economically , if its action be to contribute to a delay . </s>
a country which act in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself . </s>
on 1 January @card@ the euro will be in circulation . </s>
the whole of the Union must have the same protection , a type of protection which prohibit counterfeit , not only of currency in circulation but also of currency which will be in circulation . </s>
it be important that , in time , there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all country . </s>
the Commission have propose measure aim at provide information , together with penal sanction , preventive measure and the pool of experience . </s>
these measure do , in fact , entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the low acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeit be to be eight year ' imprisonment . </s>
trading with counterfeit currency and the possession of counterfeit equipment will also become criminal offence . </s>
quite simply , we be to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty . </s>
the denomination of the euro be well know . </s>
modern computer equipment can be use to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves . </s>
Parliament have table a number of amendment to the present proposal , for example in regard to jurisdiction , the idea be that a person may only be prosecute and sentence in the one country for the same crime . </s>
There be also propose sanction against company which be involve in counterfeit , this being a measure which we would encourage . </s>
the new applicant state be also encourage to adapt to these regulation . </s>
it have take two year for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal . </s>
it be essential that the decision should now be take in March . </s>
To delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be indefensible . </s>
it would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handle the new , unfamiliar note . </s>
in particular , it be believe that counterfeiter will turn their attention to country outside the euro zone , where people be less familiar with the new currency . </s>
the protective measure cover these country too , and the view express by these country have carry a lot of weight . </s>
the present proposal be therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character , accept responsibility for a variety of interest in a way which impose obligation upon other . </s>
the Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision . </s>
thank you for listen . </s>
thank you , too , those who contribute to this matter be be deal with swiftly . </s>
I be think in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists . </s>
Mr President , first I want to compliment the rapporteur , Charlotte Cederschiöld , on draw up this report , which be an excellent point of departure for increase protection by penal sanction against counterfeit in connection with the introduction of the euro . </s>
the euro will enter into circulation on 1 January @card@ and will become one of the world 's most important reserve currency . </s>
due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly expose to the risk of counterfeit and forgery . </s>
this draft decision therefore lay down a set of minimum standard intend to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simple and more effective . </s>
it also provide for the euro to be protect even prior to its circulation , which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States . </s>
I expressly support the rapporteur as regard the need to extend this protection to national currency which can continue to be exchange after they have be withdraw from circulation . </s>
this mean that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective , adequate penal sanction , which act as a deterrent against the offence cover by the draft framework decision . </s>
as to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight year , I do not think that this will raise any problem as far as my country be concern , even though the maximum sentence for counterfeit under its criminal code be currently five year in prison , as it have already express willingness to make this amendment . </s>
I also call on those few Member States still harbour reservation to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reach on this matter , for the reason our rapporteur set out earlier when she call for this to be do . </s>
Mr President , this draft framework decision represent the first time a common proposal on crime have be put forward , with legislation to be apply by all fifteen Member States at the same time . </s>
we be therefore make progress towards the aim of develop and confirm the status of the European union as an area of freedom , security and justice , as express at Tampere . </s>
Mr President , I need not repeat what the rapporteur say or the point Mr Coelho make . </s>
all that be indeed very true and correct . </s>
it be easy to counterfeit the euro . </s>
we be go through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon have appear in criminal law that be perhaps unique in monetary history . </s>
it be that a currency that do not even exist yet , that be not in circulation , but exist only as bank deposit money , can nevertheless be counterfeit already . </s>
yet because that currency be not yet in circulation as such , counterfeit euros do not at present constitute a criminal offence . </s>
it be a highly complex problem . </s>
if we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly say - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecute for subsequently put them into circulation . </s>
let me say in pass that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people . </s>
so what be the European union do about it ? </s>
it be do a number of thing that be right , as Mrs Cederschiöld have describe ; but , in the context of these thing she describe , Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision , not so much at the report draw up by Mrs Cederschiöld , but more at the procedure that be be apply . </s>
the manner in which the Council , which be by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe , consult the European Parliament make a mockery of the concept of democracy . </s>
we receive a text for consultation which the Council have be work on for a very long time , incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment . </s>
now the European Parliament be suppose to state its position on this complex , difficult and , at time , contradictory Council document in the space of three month . </s>
it be only thank to the immense effort of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament 's decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the document available in all the language , that we have now manage to give our position by the date set by the Council , so that the decision schedule for March can indeed be take . </s>
on a subject as important as counterfeit and protection against counterfeit and harmonise the necessary criminal law provision we can really work at the ridiculous pace the Council be demand of us . </s>
so let me state quite clearly here , on behalf of my group , that we discuss at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it be reasonable to work like this . </s>
we conclude that it be not , but give the importance of the issue we nonetheless agree to accept this procedure . </s>
this framework decision do without any doubt represent some progress . </s>
only , as Mrs Cederschiöld point out , in the end it do not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council want because various shortcoming have not be deal with . </s>
they relate to the minimum rule we be seek to establish , the minimum rule relate to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norm in all Member States , include those that have not yet introduce the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeit . </s>
One reason they have not be deal with be that as ever the leopard can change its spot , i. e. in the case of this framework decision , which specifically relate to judicial cooperation , the Council once again prefer to adhere to the level of government cooperation . </s>
that be why , and I quote , this framework decision &quot; be confine to supplement the provision of the International Convention of @card@ April @card@ for the suppression of counterfeit and its Protocol &quot; , i. e. the provision of a timeworn international convention that be a good @card@ year old . </s>
that mean that the legal basis we be now seek to establish to protect the euro do not derive from Community legislation , as it should , but merely take the form of provision supplement an international convention date back @card@ year . </s>
I leave it to the assemble company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European union base on judicial cooperation . </s>
thank you for your attention during our night sit together . </s>
Mr President , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiter . </s>
the fact be people be suddenly go to lose all their currency reference , and that mean they will be at serious risk of easily accept forge euros because they be not very familiar with the genuine article . </s>
so the Council be naturally worry and be seek to establish sanction , primarily criminal , applicable in all the country of Europe , against offence of this kind . </s>
no doubt the Council could have be satisfy with a simple resolution recommend that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect . </s>
that be what I would have prefer , personally . </s>
but , probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain member , the Council have prefer to implement a legal instrument which be more binding at European level : a framework decision . </s>
now that be where the difficulty begin , because criminal law come under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contain no specific provision cover this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voter by over-egging the pudding . </s>
the draft framework decision before us today try to cover up this lacuna by refer to Articles @card@ and @card@ ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Treaty . </s>
however , I find these passport inadequate . </s>
article @card@ only envisage minimum common rule for criminal act in certain case , specifically restrict to organise crime , terrorism and drug trafficking . </s>
counterfeit be not on the list . </s>
article @card@ , a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam , only lay down the new form of a framework decision , and clearly this only apply to the exist power of the European Union . </s>
so we come back to the previous problem . </s>
in other word , the Council have not succeed in give this text a credible legal basis . </s>
in a way , this be deferred punishment for its lack of honesty , at the time , in present the Maastricht Treaty to the voter . </s>
I would also like to make a more general point . </s>
not so long ago we be deal with one or more report on question of principle relate to the euro in virtually every part-session . </s>
but there have be nothing for a year . </s>
just a few little technical report like this one on counterfeit . </s>
the Commission 's communication on its strategic objective for @card@ , which we have debate this week , contain absolutely nothing on this vast subject , except the reminder , in a single line , that the euro coin and note be due to come into circulation on 1 January @card@ . </s>
however , there be many underlie problem yet to be resolve . </s>
let us mention , for example , the disturbing lack of public interest , the definition of monetary policy objective abusively reduce to the mere fight against inflation , the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism , the status of the present applicant country , when they become member , vis-à-vis the euro zone , the confused reaction of the international market to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation , and so on . </s>
do I also need to mention that investor who sell dollar to buy euros have lose @card@ % since 1 January @card@ , @card@ % if they buy bond , and no less than @card@ % if they sell yen to buy euros ? </s>
Mr President , for those unfortunate investor even real euros be false money . </s>
these be gigantic problem but they seem to be taboo here . </s>
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker . </s>
There be a number of question of principle which be demand solution , because the point of departure be , of course , that the regulation of criminal law be a national concern . </s>
criminal law be part of each individual nation 's own cultural tradition , and it be very difficult to arrive at common definition of what be to be understand by these basic legal concept . </s>
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld 's work , and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definition and common regulation regard what be punishable and what common sanction can be apply . </s>
she would like to devise these sanction jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offence which have particular relevance for the Eu . </s>
but the problem be that there be no legal basis for this , and with good reason , because the regulation of criminal law belong to the sphere of national jurisdiction . </s>
in that context , I want to ask the follow question of the Commission 's and the Council 's representative : be the legal basis which have be invoke adequate ? </s>
in my view , it be clearly in conflict with , and far exceed the scope of , Article @card@ , paragraph 2 , point b where a legal basis be establish for so-called framework decision which be bind upon the Member States in regard to the desire objective , but in which it be leave to the national authority to determine the form and method of implementation . </s>
What of course characterise the present draft framework decision be the fact that the Member States ' obligation be lay down in detail . </s>
There be no freedom of choice regard method and implementation . </s>
in my view , this exceed the parameter of the legal basis . </s>
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council , for I consider it obvious that Article @card@ do not supply the relevant legal basis . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , let me begin by warmly congratulate and thank the rapporteur and point out that , in her report , she do not just welcome the draft framework decision but also propose a few change , which have be refer to by various speaker but which we can discuss in detail now , to supplement and improve the text . </s>
it be crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by take inadequate measure to prevent counterfeit - and we be well aware of the initial attempt that be be make . </s>
we have all note that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risk with it . </s>
so , in addition to the effort to combat counterfeit , to ensure the sound implementation of the provision , the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do . </s>
we be also concern with the question of cooperation . </s>
we need to define the precise responsibility of the ECB , the national central bank , the Commission and Europol pertain to all matter relate to counterfeit of the euro . </s>
I also think we should perhaps consider set up an interinstitutional or Eu body in charge of coordinate the cooperation work . </s>
in the same context , we could establish an early warning system function round the clock , together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of datum between the responsible authority . </s>
aside from the report , which we welcome , many question have arise that still need to be resolve . </s>
I hope the debate we be hold here will bring some clarification . </s>
Mr President , Mrs Cederschiöld , lady and gentleman , how safe be the euro ? </s>
that be , after all , a question the people often ask . </s>
and that question will of course become increasingly press with the approach of 1 January @card@ , the date when they will have euros in their pocket . </s>
for the safety of the euro be not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but , in fact , also of protect the euro against counterfeit . </s>
that too be a concern of the people , for , as have rightly be say , this will be a new currency for them , new in term of how it look and also how it be use . </s>
of course all the citizen of the Eu Member States will also be face with the novelty of a currency that be valid over such a wide area , and even beyond Europe , as a reserve currency . </s>
they will need time to get use to that too . </s>
so it be clearly necessary to ask what the Eu be do to protect the euro against counterfeit . </s>
and that be what we be discuss at this late hour . </s>
this really be a subject that be close to the citizen , so it be a pity it be be debate at such a late hour . </s>
but that can be help . </s>
of course , the European Central Bank have be look into the matter for a very long time . </s>
after all , it be responsible for technical measure to protect against counterfeit . </s>
as have also be point out , in summer @card@ the Commission submit a communication list a very wide variety of area where measure need to be take , such as information , further training - an important area , cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them , and measure under criminal law . </s>
that be what this framework decision be about . </s>
Mrs Cederschiöld , let me offer you sincere thank on behalf of the Commission and , above all , let me also thank Parliament for be prepare to give its position in the space of such a short time . </s>
I certainly appreciate that . </s>
the framework decision aim to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeit offence . </s>
of course the first condition for uniform action be always to have uniform definition and , as be emphasise , what we be basically try to do be to ensure that the euro be protect even before it be physically introduce . </s>
naturally , the Commission be also glad that the European Parliament 's prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - mean the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now , so that we can begin to transpose it . </s>
for the Commission have be ask to report , as it will in the first half of next year , on the progress in transpose it in the Member States , on whether the serious nature of this issue be be match by serious action . </s>
it have be point out that this framework decision be in fact a decision in the area of criminal law . </s>
in that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as Mr Schulz just point out , simply supplement a rather old convention be not really a particularly bold step . </s>
in reply to the question whether the Commission consider that the framework decision have an adequate legal basis under the Treaty , the Commission believe that the right basis be be apply here . </s>
the framework decision will , however , have to be supplement by other legal act in future . </s>
the Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authority and on cooperation with Europol . </s>
that proposal will establish a duty to cooperate , and a duty on the part of the national authority to notify Europol of case of counterfeit and to present any confiscate counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification , so that effective measure can then be take . </s>
on the question of coordinate the various measure , since early @card@ , the Commission , follow now by Olaf , have be work with expert on the subject from the Member States , the European Central Bank and Europol on mean of effectively combat counterfeit of the euro in advance . </s>
as Mr Karas just point out , a few week ago the Commission submit a proposal for an information campaign on the euro , to which it propose allocate as much as EUR @card@ million . </s>
that be a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protect the euro against counterfeit . </s>
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiter who believe their hour have come , because they think the Eu be no longer awake at this late hour ! </s>
thank you very much , Commissioner Schreyer . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place tomorrow at @card@ p. m. ( the sit be close at @card@ p. m. ) resumption of the sit the Minutes of yesterday be sit have be distribute . </s>
be there any comment ? </s>
( the Minutes be approve ) Mr President , I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting hold last night by various member of Parliament from all group . </s>
the purpose of the meeting , which be attend by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors , together with the architect who design this building , be to discuss how we could improve our work condition . </s>
we discover during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you , Mr President , in fact conceal a huge window which , if the curtain be draw back , would afford a wonderful view over the river . </s>
we be tell that the curtain be close so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debate . </s>
but what be to prevent us , before the sit be open or when you close the sit , open the curtain and enjoy the apparently magnificent view behind you ? </s>
I be more than happy for our house to be illuminate by the brilliance of our debate but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss . </s>
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss open this curtain from time to time with the usher . </s>
thank you very much Mr Onesta , I be grateful for any suggestion that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort . </s>
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time be . </s>
in the meantime , I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter , technically speak . </s>
if so , then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it look when the President sit with his back to the light ! </s>
UCITS the next item be the report ( A5-0025 / @card@ ) by Mr Olle Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on : I. Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend Directive @card@ / @card@ / EEC on the coordination of law , regulation and administrative provision relate to undertaking for collective investment in transferable security ( UCITS ) with a view to regulate management company and simplify prospectus ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0465 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) ; II . </s>
proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend Directive @card@ / @card@ / EEC on the coordination of law , regulation and administrative provision relate to undertaking for collective investment in transferable security ( UCITS ) ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C4-0464 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cod ) ) . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , it be my hope that Parliament be prepare now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe . </s>
as a new Member of the European Parliament , it have be very interesting and instructive for me to be give responsibility for this important matter . </s>
I should especially like to thank my colleague on the committee for their willingness to find compromise ; the President and the Bureau for lend a sensitive ear to this complex issue ; the Commission , and especially the Commissioner , for be such worthwhile contact ; the Council ; and also the division responsible for service the committee , for its selfless work . </s>
There be a good deal of agreement within the committee , apart from on a matter which , too , I hope it will be possible to solve . </s>
the issue of UCITS may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield . </s>
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stand for . </s>
allow me , however , to state very clearly that this be a question which really do affect the citizen of Europe in so far as it relate to how their saving be administer , what option there be available , how competition operate between country in regard to different form of saving , saver ' demand for security , and the opportunity Europe 's citizen have to save wisely for their old age . </s>
it be a question of weigh demand for liberalisation in the interest of a good market and high yield against investor ' need for protection and security . </s>
in the course of the 1980s , most market in Europe undergo drastic deregulation . </s>
as a result , the national money and bond market in particular develop very quickly over a period of a few year . </s>
collective investment undertaking become an alternative to save with a bank . </s>
in my own country , more than @card@ per cent of Swede save with a variety of fund . </s>
the security afford by this type of saving be attributable to the broad range of investment vehicle in which the fund be place . </s>
the capital and security market have continue to be develop . </s>
the current directive on UCITS have become antiquated and outdated . </s>
new type of fund have be introduce in the various Member state which be not permit to market their unit in other Member States . </s>
obviously , this inhibit competition and innovation and restrict the public 's range of saving option . </s>
the Commission 's proposal with which we be deal today be in two part . </s>
the first concern the product , that be to say the fund . </s>
the other concern the collective investment undertaking . </s>
the main purpose of the first proposal be to extend the investment opportunity of collective investment undertaking by allow them to invest in unit in other collective investment undertaking , for example unit in fund , standardise option and future contract and deposit in credit institution and in certain type of money market instrument . </s>
special risk-spreading rule be propose in respect of such investment , involve both quantitative and qualitative criterion . </s>
in addition , the Commission 's proposal put forward special risk-spreading rule for fund whose aim be to replicate a particular stock index , a so-called index fund . </s>
the committee wish to make the requirement in relation to the Commission 's proposal more stringent . </s>
To guarantee transparency and prudence , investment in non-harmonised fund should only be allow on condition that qualitative criterion , for example a transparency requirement and investor protection , be introduce . </s>
in addition , quantitative criterion ( risk exposure ) should be introduce . </s>
move on now , then , to the point where there be ( or , I hope , be ) a lack of agreement , namely OTC derivative . </s>
the Commission 's proposal make a distinction between derivative deal in on regulated market and derivative instrument not deal in on regulate market ( so-called OTC derivative ) . </s>
the Commission 's proposal take it as read that OTC derivative be not one of the general type of investment that UCITS deal in , but that they should only be use to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risk . </s>
in recent year , the derivative market have grow very rapidly in almost all the Member States . </s>
it be therefore important that regulation of derivative be flexible so that the market be not tie down ahead of future development . </s>
the definition ' standardise future contract ' and ' standardise option ' should therefore be combine to form a new definition , ' financial derivative instrument ' , which also cover OTC derivative . </s>
investment in OTC derivative , however , should only be allow on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criterion be introduce . </s>
they be very important in this case . </s>
they must be introduce to guarantee the protection of investor . </s>
the Commission 's second proposal focus on the body which manage UCITS , that be to say management company . </s>
the rule for management company , for example the condition for start up and conduct business , be bring into line with the existing rule and regulation . </s>
a crucial point be that rule be propose for so-called simplify prospectus . </s>
relevant information must be give to prospective unit-holder in a fund in a language which be readily understandable to investor in the host country . </s>
in this regard , too , the committee be prepare to go further than the Commission . </s>
a question which have also be discuss in the committee be that of the capital contribution to be require from management company . </s>
There be different view on this . </s>
One of the most important thing , for me , personally , be that the common regulation should not cause small company to go under . </s>
during the month that I have be work on this report , one very clear demand have emerge , both from industry and from those who represent the consumer . </s>
the current situation be not good . </s>
both saver and the industry need modernise regulation for the whole of Europe . </s>
I believe that today 's proposal strike a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investor . </s>
I just want to conclude by say that a number of member of Parliament think that the present proposal go too far , while other think that I be not sufficiently liberal . </s>
To them I just want to say , as the English expression go , ' you can ' t have it all . </s>
' . </s>
Mr President , at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thank for the tremendous work undertake by Mr Schmidt , our rapporteur . </s>
I be in fact the surrogate father of these report during the previous Parliament . </s>
we fail over the last six year to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter . </s>
in a short space of time Mr Schmidt have manage to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament . </s>
I thank him for that . </s>
as the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I also wish to place on record my thank to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter . </s>
I be speak today wear a number of hat : firstly , as the surrogate father of this report ; secondly , as the draftsperson of the opinion ; and most importantly , as one who see the tremendous advantage which can be gain for the European union from a harmonise system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently be earn in Europe but invest outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retain within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship , employment and also for guarantee future pension right . </s>
There be little disagreement amongst member with regard to the first proposal . </s>
it put into place a certain number of control and mechanism to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonise regulatory authority . </s>
however , it be in relation to the second proposal that there be most concern . </s>
I have a number of idea which should be put across . </s>
firstly , the idea of an Eu passport for management company be to be welcome ; and the home-state approval rule be also to be welcome . </s>
however , instead of impose a new regime , we could have use the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime . </s>
it seem unusual that we fail to grasp that opportunity . </s>
Many member have be work on the basis of try to protect their own country ' national interest rather than improve the overall system for Europe . </s>
we will have to revisit this issue again in the near future . </s>
I call on member to ensure by their vote today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term . </s>
Mr President , I must firstly thank the rapporteur , Mr Schmidt , my colleague , Mr Goebbels , and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group . </s>
despite their differ opinion on some point , they have consistently work in an extremely constructive manner . </s>
as indicate by the rapporteur , we be discuss probably one of the most important issue that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament . </s>
collective investment undertaking have for some time be the primary savings vehicle through which million of ordinary citizen , without any specialist knowledge , have invest their life saving . </s>
this be the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation , albeit in a prudent manner . </s>
I say this because the failure of a bank be a problem for which any government can find a solution . </s>
however , the failure and suspension of payment of this type of undertaking would create a political , social and personal problem with incalculable consequence . </s>
There be also a second reason why prudence be need in the regulation of these undertaking . </s>
I believe in a social market economy base on a successful market operate subject to certain rule intend to guarantee the general interest . </s>
specifically , at the moment , this mean the protection of investor . </s>
this basic principle of liberalisation , increase competition and great investment opportunity , together with prudence to ensure the protection which investor deserve , have determine and inspire my Group 's position on most of the controversial point which have arise . </s>
firstly , there be the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertaking fall outside this directive . </s>
it be clear that by extend the proposal under discussion , the option and the range of investment in undertaking for collective investment , those undertaking which remain outside the rule will be oblige to invest in high-risk fund . </s>
it would be wrong to allow the regulate and protect undertaking to invest in other undertaking involve in such risky investment . </s>
secondly , the problem of derivative be one which have create the most division , both within my Group and between the group . </s>
we have achieve a compromise solution . </s>
Everyone accept that investment in derivative must be legally limit in order to prevent a harmonise fund lose all its asset due to an investment in high-risk product . </s>
it be clear that this risk be great when the investment be in derivative not deal in on a regulated market , namely the famous OTC derivative . </s>
we have achieve an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which I welcome . </s>
as this issue will be return to this house at some stage , I must highlight the work method use between the Commission and this Parliament . </s>
the text before us today be old and be already old when they reach this House . </s>
this be because they be substantially amend during the Finnish Presidency . </s>
we be therefore face with two option . </s>
we can either return the proposal to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonise text or we can continue the current process . </s>
this second option have win the day and I be please about this . </s>
however , in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institution and the Council can be improve so that our work be more understandable and more productive . </s>
Mr President , the Socialist Group support the Commission 's effort to implement the action plan for financial service . </s>
obviously , in the wake of the introduction of the euro , we need to create an integrated European financial market which be similar to the American and Japanese market . </s>
the debate on UCITS give rise to speech on behalf of all sort of lobby and heated debate in the relevant committee . </s>
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , for their constructive approach . </s>
the Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economy and to the allocation of resource . </s>
but the world of international finance be a dangerous one . </s>
the capital market be still at the mercy of their excess . </s>
There be at present a surfeit of cash look for a home . </s>
in @card@ , the increase in the means of payment in the world result in over-stimulated stock exchange and an explosion in the volume of transaction , push up the price of long-term financial and real asset . </s>
and as international financial activity speed up , the risk increase . </s>
you do not need a Nobel prise in economics to realise that the current work hypothesis of the financial market , which anticipate annual growth in profit of the order of @card@ to @card@ % be quite simply unrealistic in the medium term . </s>
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future be not inflation , but deflation generate as the speculative bubble , create by what Alan Greenspan call irrationally exuberant market , burst . </s>
the legislature have a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continue deregulation of the European financial market . </s>
by definition , investment fund use other people 's money . </s>
the legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clause . </s>
There be no freedom without rule . </s>
we have do away with so-called master-feeder structure . </s>
these feeder fund exist in the United States , which be an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system . </s>
the European market be still fragmented and such structure would doubtless cause problem . </s>
the Socialists , like the Commission , question the advisability of allow investment fund to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivative , i. e. product negotiate between professional by private contract . </s>
as these transaction be generally not subject to prudential control , the risk be all the more obvious . </s>
the Socialist Group have table amendment propose both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clause in order to contain the risk to investor . </s>
by adopt these amendment , Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivative but will also limit the risk to private investor . </s>
Mr President , there be much talk at present of the principle of good governance . </s>
this principle should not only guide the public sector , it should also guide the private sector , especially financial undertaking . </s>
Mr President , our objective in set a framework for unit trust and other UCTIS be to secure the high possible safe return for our saver , which be why I want to address the issue of derivative in my remark today . </s>
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivative can help fund secure , safe , high return . </s>
despite their image of danger , derivative be usually use by asset manager as insurance . </s>
a contract that , for example , pay a substantial sum if , say , the Nasdaq or the CAC @card@ share index fall , cause an extra payment by the investor if the Nasdaq or the CAC @card@ share index rise . </s>
be this speculative ? </s>
not at all . </s>
imagine you have spend some month build up a portfolio of share in company in which you be confident : they have good management , good prospect and they be good investment . </s>
then you become worried that the whole stock market be go to collapse , as it do in @card@ . </s>
you have the option of sell off everything and get into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winner . </s>
it would also incur all the transaction cost of sell your share and then buy them again after the fall . </s>
the solution be to take out a derivative which pay off if the Nasdaq or CAC @card@ fall . </s>
but even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheap , perhaps insure you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index , you would still have the portfolio and the share , but you would have protect yourself against the risk of a collapse . </s>
in exchange , you might also have give up some of the upside of the market . </s>
in this case , which be perhaps the most common use of derivative by asset manager , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk . </s>
that be a desirable development in a soundly manage fund . </s>
history demonstrate that investor benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation . </s>
heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector manager should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce return to saver . </s>
pension fund which suffer from rule on where they could and could not invest , as require by of our government bond , make return of @card@ % a year , barely half the @card@ % annual return make by free fund between @card@ and @card@ . </s>
these be of course the return after deduct all loss . </s>
do not confuse a real concern for the interest of investor with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pay off . </s>
this be what we should be concern about here today . </s>
Mr President , the report present to us today seek to complete the free movement of financial investment in Europe , include the most sophisticated form of investment . </s>
we do not , in principle , oppose this industry . </s>
however , unlike Mr Christopher Huhne , we feel that a continent which have prove incapable of control its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may , in time , provoke the same type of crisis . </s>
we shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendment limit recourse to excessively derivative instrument and we shall vote in favour of all amendment which limit the excessive concentration of asset within a single financial group . </s>
but we make no bone about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole . </s>
we shall also vote in the future against any proposal to deregulate the financial market and we call on all the other political group to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income be finally harmonise . </s>
for year certain country , include Great Britain , have be block harmonisation and turn their financial centre into tax haven . </s>
they even reject the strict minimum , I. E. the Monti package propose by the Commission in Brussels . </s>
this attitude be turn Europe into a machine which exempt investment income from tax and shift the whole tax burden to commercial income , with all the social and even moral consequence which that imply . </s>
we must put an end to this . </s>
by block the demand of the financial industry , the European Parliament have the mean to ensure that country which have be turn into tax haven end up with their back against the wall . </s>
Mr President , the @card@ directive introduce a sort of European visa for certain type of UCITS which could be market throughout the Union . </s>
since then , the capital market and transferable security have not just continue to evolve ; thank to unbridled financial globalisation , they have explode exponentially and without restraint . </s>
this bring us to the two proposal for directive . </s>
the second proposal , on which the report be excellent , do not require any particular comment . </s>
it aim to strengthen consumer protection and security . </s>
it be a step in the right direction , even if one wonder why in heaven , with what right and with what respect for our citizen , we be further bolster the monopoly of the English language in all document distribute throughout Europe . </s>
that be the thrust of an amendment which we have table ; it favour all the language of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it . </s>
the same can be say of the first proposal . </s>
we might have be able to agree to the original text insofar as it be inform by a legitimate concern to update current legislation . </s>
however , we be unable to agree to the text of the report , although I welcome the work carry out by Mr Schmidt , for several reason . </s>
first , it lean too far towards product base on index which have no bearing on the real economy ; derivative which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz refer to just now . </s>
secondly , like him , I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in fund which , in the final analysis , will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension fund . </s>
There be , of course , no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS . </s>
we shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to @card@ % ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , this be a vital issue for Europe . </s>
a Europe that face an impending pension time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their saving . </s>
I welcome many of the development which Mr Schmidt 's report bring us . </s>
UCITS be a success story within the European Union . </s>
they be a safe product , trade cross-border . </s>
but it be time for the legislation to be update . </s>
Mr Schmidt have do an excellent job here . </s>
it be no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt 's report not to have be alter so much as it pass through Parliament . </s>
but I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue . </s>
the radical step take by this report be to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivative . </s>
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the product which will be use by UCITS . </s>
we be not talk about the use of derivative for speculation . </s>
we be talk about the use of derivative to reduce risk and to increase the return on the saving of ordinary European . </s>
Mr Schmidt be to be applaud for have obtain the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivative . </s>
we must not be afraid to go forward , to react to change in the market . </s>
yes , we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumer . </s>
the report give very adequate protection for consumer . </s>
but a number of the amendment go too far in restrict the use of over-the-counter derivative . </s>
I feel these derivative will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trust , which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their saving . </s>
I salute Mr Schmidt . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , it have become necessary to amend the UCITS directive because the old directive no longer reflect the reality of the financial market . </s>
a major factor in this respect be that individual investor be make capital investment through undertaking for collective investment in transferable security . </s>
Master-feeder fund be therefore at variance with the aim of the directive and the Committee on Economic Affairs be right to reject them for this reason . </s>
individual investor need transparency with regard to the risk associate with management company and product . </s>
the product must be design in such a way that even individual make small-scale investment over-the-counter fully understand what they be let themselves in for . </s>
under the term of the European passport for UCITS , this mean that national supervisory authority have to apply uniform standard in monitor product and management company . </s>
discretionary power for national supervisory authority must be restrict if we be to create transparency and people be to have faith in the product and management company in the internal market . </s>
it be therefore an important achievement of the UCITS production line to have pick out as a central theme the association between derivative and OTC paper in the interest of efficient portfolio management , for one of the old directive 's major disadvantage be that each regulatory body understand efficient portfolio management to mean something different . </s>
the European Parliament would be well advise to strengthen consumer protection in Europe . </s>
the consumer do not automatically receive information about all the product on offer and the risk associate with many of these product . </s>
Europe must not be a paradise for investment company , bank , insurer or their lobbyist . </s>
thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn . </s>
lady and gentleman , I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation . </s>
if we open this curtain , then we will find that there be a partition wall behind it which can just be remove straight away . </s>
we will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sit . </s>
however , I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lie . </s>
Mr President , the UCITS directive have be an enormous success since it enter into force on 1 October @card@ , mainly thank to the excellent protection which it offer investor . </s>
the directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investor have allow the investment fund industry to multiply its asset in the European Union fivefold . </s>
There have be a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investment within the European Union and the directive itself be use as a model for legislation throughout the world . </s>
however , the directive be ten year old and , now that the market have develop and more and more sophisticated financial product be available , it be somewhat outdated . </s>
the Commission proposal be debate here will give it the face-lift it need . </s>
I share some of the concern express here , especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , but this face-lift would be even more successful if the fund which simply reproduce a stock exchange index , and which be therefore manage either passively or not at all , and the fund which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund be treat in the same way , if only to allow medium-sized undertaking list on the stock exchange but not include in the stock exchange index good access to the capital market . </s>
in addition , investor often have good protection with an actively-managed fund . </s>
My Amendment no @card@ be therefore a warning for amateur . </s>
as far as the proposal for a new provision limit investment in the same group to @card@ % be concern , I would like to stress that , apart from the fact that this limit be too low , the text do not define the concept of a group . </s>
this concept do not exist under European law because it be impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice . </s>
I shall therefore vote against this propose amendment . </s>
To conclude , Mr President , allow me to remind the house that the directive need a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive , but it do not need to be strap into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it . </s>
- ( de ) Mr President , the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital market have already produce a large and deep European financial area , which be help to open up market and create price transparency , but also to increase competition . </s>
at the same time , it be important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealing , particularly those we be concern with today . </s>
at the end of @card@ there be almost @card@ @card@ investment fund register as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion , thereby account for roughly @card@ % of all fund asset . </s>
hence the Commission rightly cite the economic importance thereof in its proposal for draft directive , and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission 's proposal . </s>
we be all aware how difficult it be to improve a legal framework for investment fund , and how difficult it be to construct the European passport for management company around particular standard which be to apply even-handedly across the board . </s>
this therefore represent a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulation for financial market and financial product . </s>
it be also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it be very important for this to be reflect in the Commission 's proposal and that of the European Parliament , as well as in the compromise motion . </s>
however , I do not believe that we can assess the risk associate with the OTC derivative , and I also think that as a European Parliament it be our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumer - who expect investment fund to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it come to long-term security , and indeed that be why they be know as investment saving - that these product do not bear comparison and that be why we need a minimum level of protection . </s>
why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afford by the trade in transferable security directive , Article @card@ for example , which relate to good practice ? </s>
I therefore believe that this be another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumer and investor could be make aware of a fund 's name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion bring with it several welcome reform to the current legal provision . </s>
the preparatory work have largely consist of a viable balance between increase the efficacy and growth of the European investment market and preserve a sufficient level of protection for consumer who buy fund unit . </s>
the great the trust consumer have in investment market operation , the more consumer will be prepare to invest on the open market . </s>
and the more consumer invest , the bright the prospect will be in the European business money market . </s>
it be quite clear that when business can more easily have access to their own capital-based finance their financial structure will be more firmly base , and , thus , opportunity for growth and investment will also improve . </s>
whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS be not relevant here . </s>
although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we be very much in agreement with the aim of the legislative amendment , the debate we have be not the easy one . </s>
for me personally at least , difficulty be cause by the directive 's technical division into two different proposal , which certainly do not make it easy to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject . </s>
however , I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposal . </s>
firstly , I be very satisfy that the proposal for a directive as a whole increase the scope of investment fund for target capital at different instrument . </s>
as regard derivative , I consider the position adopt by the committee justify - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath , for example . </s>
the directive should not treat over-the-counter derivative differently from standard derivative because they be use in many Member States and be also use before . </s>
with regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive , the so-called article on Delegation , I think the Commission 's original proposal on rule concern authorisation be good than the one now approve in the committee , so I would support some of Mrs Villiers ' amendment to this point . </s>
Mr President , I see two problem with this morning 's debate . </s>
firstly , when I come to this Parliament many year ago I be tell that if you have a difficult job you give it to a Liberal . </s>
now I have be tell that if you have a difficult debate you know you be in trouble if half the Luxembourg member be in the Chamber at one time - and they be . </s>
firstly , I welcome proposal no 1 . </s>
it simplify thing and bring thing up to date . </s>
I think many of the British member will be vote against a large number of the amendment in the report . </s>
we support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive set a lot of quantity limit that restrict the ability to spread risk . </s>
we believe that a more liberal market be the good way forward . </s>
secondly , we consider proposal no 2 to be very confuse . </s>
it be difficult to understand , and we think the Commission would be well advise to look at it again . </s>
if further regulation be need , we feel that it could be well achieve by other mean than those propose in the directive . </s>
in particular , we disagree with the proposal on capital requirement because if they be put too high they could actually drive some business out of the industry altogether . </s>
we ask the Commission to look again at these proposal . </s>
finally , we would urge member to vote in particular against Amendment No @card@ on capital requirement , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry . </s>
Mr President , money do not smell , as the Roman would say . </s>
the important thing be for money to generate more money . </s>
this be the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interest of economist converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollar , like Disney 's Scrooge McDuck , who have dollar sign for eye , except in this case the symbol be that of the euro . </s>
in this we be combine the interest of these citizen with the interest of pensioner who want to live life in tranquillity . </s>
for example , my brother-in-law , who live in Rome , start draw his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wake until midnight - he have check the TV screen to see how the pension fund and the security in which he have invest be perform . </s>
pensioner will , in the future - as be already happen - have enormous sum of money at their disposal . </s>
indeed , whilst the young be penniless , the elderly have accumulate money and , since they be keen to turn it to good advantage , harbour great hope for this directive . </s>
if national government have in their heart - as the European Union have in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earn during the course of a work life , the pension time bomb would already have be defuse . </s>
you too , in your role , Commissioner Bolkestein , have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioner , a future that I hope will improve once we have finalise this directive , by which I mean very soon , as have be propose by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , although many of my propose amendment be reject in committee , I welcome the compromise and the draft . </s>
it be my belief that , at the end of the day , we should once again point out that as far as this directive be concern , follow the introduction of the euro in @card@ , it be the creation of a single European market that take precedence . </s>
we should also cast our mind back to the disadvantage of the old regulation . </s>
fund at national level be unable to reap the benefit of single European passport , which be provide for in the @card@ directive . </s>
the range of option for investor be limit . </s>
innovation be not encourage and various regulation and protective measure for investor in each country create obstacle to competition . </s>
it be therefore necessary to update the existing regulation . </s>
the new regulation will afford the follow benefit : harmonisation of competition condition and uniform and effective protection for investor - I particularly welcome the introduction of simplify prospectus in this respect , for they will make it easy for people to compare and assess fund ; alternative method of saving be be create for the general public - this be particularly important in term of make additional provision for old age - and there be new opportunity for enterprise to acquire capital . </s>
however , I would also like to point out that some people be a little concern that the proposal have show an inclination towards restrict transaction between UCITS and depository . </s>
inappropriate restriction on such relationship should be avoid at all cost , for they fail to take account of the European-style universal banking culture . </s>
. </s>
( NL ) Mr President , could I first of all express my heartfelt thank to rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , and the member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which have principal authority , as well as the rapporteur , Mr Brian Crowley and the member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposal . </s>
since the approval of Directive @card@ / @card@ , the investment fund sector have undergo lengthy development and it be now important to modernise the rule . </s>
the aim of the new proposal be to maintain the high level of protection for the benefit of investor , which be an essential precondition for market integration result from the launch of the euro . </s>
since the average European family put its saving in investment fund , the proposal contain provision on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading be concern . </s>
the two proposal form a coherent whole . </s>
the first proposal extend the number of instrument in which an ' undertake for collective investment in transferable security ' ( UCITS ) can invest . </s>
as already remark in this session , UCITS be key player within the modern capital market . </s>
their presence offer the opportunity to a large number of ordinary investor to participate in these market , in which the principle of risk-spreading be take into consideration , protect by appropriate supervision . </s>
since diverse type of investment be permit , private investor can also benefit from all the advantage of new investment technique . </s>
the second proposal expand the role which these important intermediary organisation can play within the Eu capital market in term of develop the investment fund sector . </s>
by allow branch to be set up and certain service to be provide on a cross-border basis , these organisation will at long last be able to apply the freedom of the Treaty of Rome , which they have be deny for all these year . </s>
the Commission welcome many of the clarification propose by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arm and will adopt a large number of its idea . </s>
the Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I be now refer to the most recent number - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ for the first proposal , and @card@ , @card@ and @card@ for the second proposal , since these be really very useful clarification and improvement . </s>
I also value the idea put forward in Amendments Nos 1 , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , although the wording need to be adapt . </s>
I also endorse the rationale underlie the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos @card@ , @card@ and @card@ . </s>
I can also accept the idea in the second propose paragraph of Amendment No @card@ . </s>
All the amendment I have list so far pertain to the first proposal . </s>
as far as the second proposal be concern , the idea of Amendments Nos @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and some part of @card@ , which contain sensible suggestion , can be adopt , again formulate appropriately . </s>
the Commission have suggest adopt the content of these , with certain change in the wording . </s>
moreover , I have take note of the request make by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text , once it have be approve - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment no @card@ of the second proposal . </s>
the Commission be in favour of codification and will , in the foreseeable future , once the proposal have be approve and subject to its right of initiative , concentrate its effort on draft a codify version . </s>
however , I can accept the wording of the consideration as it stand . </s>
the Commission be also of the opinion that a number of the amendment propose by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal . </s>
this be why the Commission regret that it be unable to accept the follow amendment to the first proposal : Amendment No 8 because the propose , general reference to asset ' cover by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to asset ' mention in Article @card@ of this Directive ' , hinder implementation . </s>
this Amendment could also lead to different interpretation in the Member States , which might well look for similar instrument in other article of the directive . </s>
amendment no @card@ jeopardise the protection of investor because a block security deposit with a third party custodian be a contradiction in term . </s>
neither be security lend transaction via security clear house or exchange - as oppose to the purchase and sale of security - automatically cover by these institution . </s>
we can , therefore , adopt the propose Amendment for this reason . </s>
amendment no @card@ relate to a provision which be not change by the proposal and which have not cause any problem since the implementation of the directive . </s>
I therefore can see any reason why Article @card@ , paragraph 3 should be omit and reject the amendment for this reason . </s>
Amendment No @card@ can be accept because , if it be prescribe that non-harmonised fund be subject to rule which have be ' impose by the directive ' concern lending , borrowing , sell from an uncover position and the third party custodian , this will indeed lead to a situation where very few fund , for example Swiss fund , would be eligible for investment . </s>
this go against the Commission 's intention to widen the scope of investment , and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreement . </s>
Amendment No @card@ be unacceptable as far as the propose change to the first paragraph of Article 22a be concern , because this proposal completely clash with the spread rule of Article @card@ , especially when the UCITS be oblige to indicate a point of reference in their prospectus , as discuss in the Council . </s>
the key issue regard the first proposal , however , be Parliament 's amendment which allow the use of over-the-counter instrument for general investment purpose . </s>
the Commission point out that , accord to the national legislation of some Member States , the use of OTC derivative for general investment purpose be already authorise . </s>
however , the Commission will be suspend its position , give the intrinsically high risk of these investment compare to the more traditional financial instrument . </s>
I believe that OTC instrument could lead to problem , because they be not liquid , the price be difficult to estimate and they entail uncover counterparty risk . </s>
it seem inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investment as non-harmonised fund or deposit and , at the same time , freely to allow investment in clearly more risky OTC instrument . </s>
by reject the rapporteur 's Amendment No @card@ , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have align itself with the Council . </s>
the upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that fund be allow , in theory , to invest in OTC instrument and to trade the right of participation in their fund across the entire internal market . </s>
in practice , access to other Eu market for these theoretically harmonise fund which invest in OTC instrument can be block by apply different national legislative framework and protective measure against OTC investment . </s>
this would contravene the fact that Eu legislation apply to all fund which invest in OTC instrument . </s>
give this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risk inherent in OTC instrument , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ , @card@ and @card@ and part of Amendments Nos @card@ , @card@ and @card@ which pertain to OTC instrument . </s>
as far as the second proposal be concern , I already mention that the Commission will take into consideration many amendment . </s>
despite this , there be some amendment which the Commission can adopt : Amendment No @card@ , which do not seem to observe the order in which licence be grant and activity start ; part of Amendment No @card@ , especially the part where the prevention of conflict of interest be delete , the delegation of task be restrict to component of management decision and the general decision-taking of Member States concern delegation be repeal ; Amendment No @card@ because the Commission be of the opinion that the application of Article @card@ of the directive in unchanged form have prove adequate for the trading in right of participation in UCITS . </s>
the application of the provision of the directive concern the performance of service in the field of investment in security , well know as ISD , be therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulty or confusion . </s>
Amendment No @card@ be ambiguous regard ' the language ' of the guest member state , especially when there be various official language , and it be questionable what will be gain from translation in two other language . </s>
Amendment No @card@ be unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension fund can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activity . </s>
I think that pension fund could also benefit from this possibility , provide that management company be not lump together with pension fund , but may only carry out part of the management per delegation . </s>
Amendment No @card@ can be accept because legally , it can command any authority . </s>
management company which be deny access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permit in another Member State . </s>
amendment Nos @card@ , @card@ and @card@ , which share the same basis , be not acceptable because they make substantial change to the consistent approach of the Commission regard the regulation of third party delegation , and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authority and investor . </s>
I would like to finish off by comment on the remark make by a few member this morning and , Mr President , with your permission , I will do this in English . </s>
first of all , regard the remark of Mr Crowley , who ask whether the second proposal could not simply consist in take over a pure ISD approach ; the objection of the Commission to that proposal would be the following : such an approach would pose difficulty which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authority and non-consistent set of rule ; moreover there would be no provision whatsoever on conflict of interest . </s>
for example , a management company might be do underwriting business and , if not able to sell , it would put the security in the fund it would manage , or else there might be difficulty in which order business should be execute if the management company do broker business . </s>
furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I be sure he already know - do not cover collective management business . </s>
lastly , his proposal would not give any passport to management company which do not want to render ISD activity . </s>
as regard the question put by Mr Huhne , his reference in the intervention he make this morning be to hedge operation . </s>
but hedge operation be already allow in the existing Article @card@ ( 1 ) of Directive @card@ / @card@ on UCITS . </s>
so what Mr Huhne want be already possible . </s>
a question have be put by Mrs Villiers who refer to enhance portfolio management . </s>
that be also something which be allow under present legislation . </s>
I refer to the same Article @card@ I refer to in relation to Mr Huhne 's question . </s>
in her question Mrs Kauppi ask why the Commission have prepare a package of measure distribute in two separate proposal . </s>
the reason be that the first proposal focus essentially on the product , while the second proposal focus essentially on the service provider , and on prospectus for UCITS . </s>
the separation of these two proposal which deal with two different set of problem would facilitate the negotiate process in the Council . </s>
the Commission have not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposal but , as be well-known , must also deal with the Council . </s>
that be the reason why the Commission have put forward these two separate proposal . </s>
lastly , Mr Balfe have complain that there be , in his opinion , too many limit in the whole proposal the Commission have put forward . </s>
it seem to us that these limit be justify : firstly , by the need to diversify investment ; secondly , because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time ; thirdly , in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment fund . </s>
these be the reason why the Commission believe , because of the prudence that have to be exercise in this field , that these various limit be necessary . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ noon . </s>
mutual assistance in criminal matter between the Member States the next item be the report ( A5-0019 / @card@ ) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' freedom , and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establish the convention on Mutual Assistance in criminal matter between the Member States of the European Union . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , in letter date 3 August @card@ and 3 December @card@ , the Council call on the European Parliament , pursuant to Article @card@ of the Treaty , to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aim at guarantee improve mutual assistance in criminal matter . </s>
it be thus , as you can see , a very important draft , that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance . </s>
in actual fact , there be still certain difference of opinion within the Council over the type of convention , and over certain provision contain therein . </s>
some of these difference have already be iron out , but other persist . </s>
the spirit of the proposal be nevertheless to equip those responsible for apply the law - primarily the judiciary , but also the citizen concern - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime , which respect fundamental guarantee as regard defence and general principle of human right . </s>
it be for this reason that , despite the many omission in the text , the provision set out therein could - and I say could , Mr President - be accept on condition that they be suitably amend in order to ensure they can be implement by those responsible for apply the law and be acceptable to the citizen . </s>
the Commission have propose various amendment to this end , all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggest a series of technical adjustment that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regard the amendment propose . </s>
the amendment can be summarise as follow : they place great emphasis on fundamental right of defence , introduce a range of technical modification need to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passage more comprehensible , and delete the section relate to the remote interception of telecommunication , an area which still require not only increase technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the government of the various Member States of the Union . </s>
the proposal , as formulate by the Council and subsequently amend by the Commission , provide for a convention base on three title : the first lay down guideline for ensure the consistency of procedure and formality for letter rogatory ; the second list a whole series of specific request for mutual assistance and define the formality and procedure which must be follow in relation to these specific type of mutual assistance ; the third and last provide for and codify the procedure via which telephone conversation conduct by citizen in a State other than the one instigate proceeding can and must be intercept . </s>
Mr President , international cooperation be certainly need in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crime which be commit in one state , but the evidence for which be to be find in another . </s>
it be nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other , even more delicate issue into account : the whole issue of double jeopardy , that of speciality , and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authority of other Member States of the Union . </s>
these be thus extremely important question , which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulate a new opinion . </s>
as regard other aspect of this subject , Mr President , I would refer you to my written report . </s>
- ( ES ) Mr President , I want to start by say that I be speak on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party which I represent on this issue . </s>
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council be not present today . </s>
by contrast , I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino , as have consistently be the case since his appointment . </s>
this lead me to another point . </s>
this House have only prepare one report on this convention . </s>
it be in fact consult on a text which be not the text be work on by the Council and which do not contain point which have already be agree . </s>
I condemn this , as well as the Council 's absence . </s>
these be serious matter on which this House must act . </s>
we be about to advance into new territory where attitude and symbol be of great significance . </s>
a political community be reflect in the justice which it hand out . </s>
this be why this report be so important . </s>
it represent a step towards the area of freedom , security and , particularly , justice to which we all aspire . </s>
it be also an important step towards European natural justice . </s>
this will be build on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal system and on the confidence of the European people in any European court . </s>
it will also be build on scrupulous respect for fundamental right and freedom and on the guarantee of fair trial in particular . </s>
it be in this respect that this House have significantly - and in my opinion rightly - alter the balance propose by the Council by firmly and decidedly support a reinforcement of these guarantee of fair trial in all the amendment . </s>
Mr President , as the rapporteur say , this House have concentrate on the particular issue of phone tap in order to remove this from the convention . </s>
on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party , I have table an amendment to the motion for a resolution which ask the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible . </s>
the regulation of phone tap in the Council document be incomplete and therefore inadequate . </s>
yet a lack of regulation be also inappropriate and may lead to abuse in the telecommunication field . </s>
in fact , we be aware that these be already happen widely . </s>
the other point which I must highlight and on which we have also work extensively be the use of video conference with regard to accuse person . </s>
again on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party , I have ask the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue , which be frankly unsatisfactory . </s>
apart from a few exception , the member of the Group of the European People 's Party will vote in favour of the committee 's amendment , and of course our own . </s>
Mr President , it be our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinge on the construction of a common judicial system , for the Europe that we want to build , which comprise administrative law , civil law , both substantive and procedural , and criminal law , both substantive and procedural . </s>
the Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal matter , which we be examine today , be but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe , which have its natural foundation in fundamental human right and freedom . </s>
thus it be that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matter must also strictly respect fundamental right , principle which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation : I be think of fair trial , and more particularly of the right of the defence , of the impartiality and integrity of judge , of the length of legal proceeding , for which my country , Italy , unfortunately have the bad record in term of the number of sentence hand down , of the case pend before the European Court of Human Rights . </s>
restriction on fundamental right can and must not be apply to the field of law unless they be justify in that they be associate with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law . </s>
the report that the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and Rights have substantially amend with regard to its original formula , take up many of the amendment we have present , still leave room for a certain confusion , in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunication and video conference be to be regulate . </s>
the news receive in recent week on the way in which modern technology facilitate interception mean that great attention must be pay to this issue : we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scene depict by Orwell . </s>
this be only the beginning of a great project in the field of law , which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , it may not have be give all that much attention in this House this morning but Mr Di Pietro 's report be one of the most important report that the Committee on Fundamental Freedoms and Internal Affairs have ever have to debate in the course of the last few year . </s>
it be one of the most important report because it be concern with an extremely sensitive aspect of Europe 's political future . </s>
as economic integration within Europe be proceed at an ever-faster pace we be create a large area of free and unrestricted economic activity . </s>
but wherever such a large area of free , unimpeded economic activity come into be , by the same token there be a great deal of scope for free , unimpeded and illegal economic activity . </s>
we be therefore face a situation where we have an economic area which offer perfect opportunity for unlimited criminal activity ; however combat such activity , both in term of police and judicial cooperation - unlike legislation on business and commerce , which have become Community law - be still largely the preserve of inter-state relation . </s>
the Di Pietro report put its finger on the problem , i. e. that the measure necessary to combat crime have to be organise down to the last detail at inter-state agreement level . </s>
and if you ever have occasion to talk to practise judge or public prosecutor about how long it take these day for request for mutual assistance in criminal matter to be resolve in manifestly obvious , open and shut , serious criminal case of a cross-border nature , then you will reach the conclusion that even after the agreement we be now discuss and which Mr Di Pietro have draft a report on , have come into force , we can assume that although there may be certain technical and organisational improvement , in fact we have only just start out on the road to fast , more efficient and unimpeded cooperation between judge in the European union There be still a long way to go before we have what we urgently need ( and this be also the view hold by my group ) , that be a European Public Prosecutor who will cooperate with a European police force in clearly define area of competence and who will succeed , by mean of this cooperation , not just in have offender arrest in the Union follow police measure , but also in make the result of police investigative work usable by the court . </s>
and this usability by the court must not founder on nation state sovereignty reservation , for that be the crux of the matter . </s>
we have follow this report most attentively and we have support most of Mr Di Pietro 's point . </s>
I would like to draw your attention to two particularly interesting issue that arise during debate . </s>
the first be that it become apparent from the telephone bug example and the debate surround this complex of issue , that possibility for intervention in fundamental civil liberty , which be emerge in the European Union - for example , when we talk in term of one country undertake telephone bug in another country - and the associate issue of the guarantee of fundamental right that those who be affect need , be not sufficiently regulate within the European Union . </s>
this be evidence of the fact that , logically , the Charter for Fundamental Rights that we be currently discuss - now be precisely the right time - should be integrate into the Eu Treaty so that the European authority be compel to uphold fundamental right . </s>
we also note with great interest that the rapporteur be a well-known representative of the Italian judiciary and that the vast majority of the propose amendment to his report be table by a Member who be currently be prosecute by the Italian judiciary . </s>
it be a curious thing when Italy 's criminal prosecution authority , which be affect by what go on in this Parliament , see amendment table by people who be be prosecute in Italy itself - rightly , as I see it . </s>
no doubt , Mr Dell ' Utri 's name be still on the list of speaker . </s>
Mr President , committee amendment and political group amendment may be table in plenary , but not amendment from individual member . </s>
Mr Schulz should be aware of this . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who , in a short space of time , have have to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today . </s>
crime in the European Union have increase to such an extent that we can and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affair . </s>
the European Parliament be certainly not to blame for this . </s>
it be the government of the Member States who have restrict the amount of leeway to this degree . </s>
as a result , the European Parliament be face with an almost impossible task . </s>
one have to content oneself with the idea that all mean , however slight , must be seize upon in order to set up well legal assistance . </s>
by way of paradox , I could say that it would be good if as little as possible be say about this report , for the clear we make it that only very small step be be take , the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organise crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious . </s>
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality , that be to say the fact that crime be develop faster than the law . </s>
the goal be , after all , to provide the judicial body - magistrate , in the first place , but also the citizen involve - with the instrument to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantee of defence and the general principle of human right . </s>
if not , we will be fight a run battle . </s>
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the Eu Member States in the first instance . </s>
in my opinion , this be the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States . </s>
as long as this harmonisation have not be achieve , however , we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance . </s>
To this end , I have submit an amendment stipulate that legal assistance can only be grant in the event of criminal prosecution institute by the authority base on fact which be punishable accord to the national law of the petition party and the Member State petition . </s>
the content of my amendment be , in fact , echo in Amendment No @card@ , which also stipulate this condition of accrual . </s>
this condition of accrual be essential since , in my opinion , the principle of nulla poena sine lege , legality in criminal law , must be observe . </s>
as such , any request for legal assistance concern a hypothetical action which be not a crime in the petition Member State contravene this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principle of justice in the petition Member State . </s>
hence , it be extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopt . </s>
finally , I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro have , in my opinion , deliver sterling work by submit a report which , within the limitation , offer all possible guarantee for safeguard individual human right and fundamental freedom . </s>
if , however , we would like to give European citizen a great sense of security , we need to step up our effort in the field of judicial cooperation . </s>
Mr President , my Group be delight about the fact that an agreement will be reach to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affair . </s>
the aim of regulation be to define the reciprocal right and duty of States or citizen or those applicable in the relationship between citizen and government . </s>
the present proposal be complex , because it deal with agreement between Member States but have far-reaching consequence for the citizen-government relationship . </s>
it be precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council 's proposal leave a great deal to be desire . </s>
in the word of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro , the proposal even contain colossal shortcoming . </s>
Thank to the agreement , it be possible to create a chain of legal assistance request , whereby each link represent authority and criminal law system of different Member States . </s>
the chain be arrange in such a way as to ensure that it can fall as a whole within the competence of one court . </s>
additional measure be hence require , such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigator to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material be use . </s>
the fact that the Council 's proposal ride roughshod over the principle of proportionality be also hard to deal with for my Group . </s>
There be certainly no restriction in its scope . </s>
as such , the agreement apply not only to fight serious crime and organise crime . </s>
in fact , it be not write anywhere that it be restrict to criminal law . </s>
it be , therefore , conceivable that the European Union will soon be take a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the right of the citizen will vanish in the dust . </s>
Mr President , the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matter that we be examine today contain the minimum requirement for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative body concern . </s>
it pertain , among other thing , to notification , information exchange , the temporary transfer of detainee , the restitution of property , testimony via video conference , investigative activity and ' undercover ' activity , and the interception of telephone call . </s>
this be the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reach , and it should immediately be say that if any amendment , such as Amendments Nos @card@ or @card@ , or the revise Amendments Nos @card@ or @card@ , be to be pass , the whole convention would be reduce to an exchange of notification or information and at this point should simply be scrap , and we would vote against it . </s>
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other group will lead them to reject these amendment . </s>
the fact that the convention have not be turn into a framework agreement also constitute a defeat for this Parliament . </s>
as Commissioner Vitorino will have note in all the various speech , the need have emerge to draw up a framework of common rule , which be to say that we can continue in this manner , with this disparate agenda , with these piecemeal agreement which relate to diverse sector such as that of investigation . </s>
What be , on the other hand , absolutely necessary be to have a bare minimum of set rule that be valid within the Community , and which clearly provide as many additional safeguard as possible , and will also provide guarantee with a view to enlargement . </s>
my thought turn to what may become of this Community , of these convention and judicial relation if , for example , a fascist country such as Turkey become a member of the Union . </s>
it would truly perplex me . </s>
we need a corpus iuris - as everyone have say - and common rule , especially procedural one , which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community . </s>
it be clear that this be primarily an issue for the IGC and one that address an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depend on the Council and the Commission . </s>
I believe that this first half of the year , in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council , provide an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this share aspiration . </s>
it be precisely for this reason that we be in favour of adopt Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ , which already prefigure a minimum of set rule on interception and on video conference . </s>
on the one hand , we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote , precisely so that this convention - which , I repeat , already set minimum rule - be not strip of all meaning , while on the other hand we be also look forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively put into effect this minimum Community law . </s>
Mr President , confront with the burgeon phenomenon of organise crime at international level , the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible . </s>
indeed , they must set in place the institutional condition need to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stage need to prevent the untimely imposition that be detrimental to legitimate national prescription in the field of justice , over which Member States have sovereign power , and above all to prevent imposition that result in ride roughshod over basic civil right . </s>
we must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which , as the rapporteur himself have underline , now claim , after year of discussion , to have find a universal solution in the space of a few month . </s>
furthermore - and I agree with the assessment make by Mr Di Pietro - the Council 's text would appear to be overladen with contradiction , inconsistent proposition and omission . </s>
it be clear that the justice sector , more than any other , can be handle in an inconsistent or contradictory manner . </s>
it be the opinion of our Group that even the report , consider as a whole , would be the subject of much debate , notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendment that take into account the safeguard of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignty . </s>
the report contain argument that be too disparate , which do not link together smoothly , and everything thus hinge on approximation . </s>
we will , in conclusion , vote against this report , while stress that the Europe to which we aspire be a Europe of right and guarantee : right and guarantee that call for gradual and responsible discussion , as well as very serious examination . </s>
we must first establish general rule and institutional certainty . </s>
only then will we be able to institute actual convention . </s>
Mr President , on behalf of the member of Parliament on the Bonino List , I intend to confirm the position that we adopt in the Committee on Civil Liberties and be thus also announce our vote on their behalf . </s>
it be a vote against this report , or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report be base . </s>
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work . </s>
he listen very closely to our argument at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respect the right of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance . </s>
the committee and the rapporteur have incorporate nine of the eleven amendment that we present , and these centre precisely on the right of the defence . </s>
this spur us to maintain that the European Parliament would have do sterling work in guarantee that civil right and freedom be safeguard , if this be a lawmaking parliament and if we be , as part of this procedure , in fact co-legislators - which we be not . </s>
this be the problem , and it be for this reason that we be critical of the position adopt by the Council , which be one we find completely unsatisfactory . </s>
this be a task that have last three year , and on which we have be consult , so to speak , as a matter of course , when this issue , as have already be stress , comprise highly important formal and substantive facet , which call for a range of assessment , consultation , concerted action and codecisions . </s>
it would seem to us that the Council have take the various issue - those of legitimate interception , the right of the defence , the right of detainee and of the authority legally empower to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly . </s>
we should have request and reject the first version of the convention , and then request another : the majority on the committee do not want this and it be for this reason that we will vote against it , even if we hope that the amendment , which nevertheless improve the text , can be incorporate by the Council - we doubt that they will be , but hope all the same that they be . </s>
in my Group , there be undoubtedly different view of Mr Di Pietro 's report . </s>
I agree that it be - as have be say - a good and competent piece of work , which have be carry out under difficult condition . </s>
the Danish member of the Group can vote in favour of the proposal but will , on the contrary , be support a number of amendment , especially those table by the green . </s>
There be two reason why we be say no . </s>
firstly , these be immensely complicate and very sensitive legal question which be at issue and , to my mind , the proposal entail some risk to legal certainty , which have not be fully realise . </s>
this be in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support . </s>
the other main reason , however , be that , even though we be concern here with a convention ( and therefore with international cooperation ) , there be no doubt about the trend express in the proposal . </s>
and the trend be towards create , in the long term , a common European area of jurisdiction , common Eu criminal law and common Eu administration of justice . </s>
we would warn against that trend . </s>
we have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom , Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lie in its establishment of Eu system which will play havoc with exist legal tradition relate to these sensitive and important question which be overwhelmingly national in character . </s>
Mr President , alarm as I be at the prejudgement issue by @card@ Member States , I maintain that the planned agreement can only signify a first step in the right direction . </s>
the fact that we have labour for year on this issue show how difficult it be to see our work germinate community-wide , which be what we need so badly . </s>
There be no doubt that we only be able to combat organise crime in a constructive and efficient manner if we take action at Community level . </s>
the criminal have a natural headstart and this must be curtail . </s>
in this respect , the Di Pietro report have special significance , and I fully agree with Mr Schulz there , which be most unusual . </s>
however I must also concur with the rapporteur when he state that this Council text do not make the grade in term of offer a solution . </s>
it be not homogeneous and nor be it systematic enough . </s>
however , I believe that it could be substantially improve with the aid of amendment and I feel that in this case a little be more than nothing at all . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , group of expert have inform us that @card@ % of crime in Europe can now be attribute to cross-border , international crime . </s>
that be a dramatic development . </s>
on the other hand , our police force and criminal prosecution authority be organise at national level . </s>
and so we know that if criminal can go about their business without be subject to border control or pay heed to law , and have almost unlimited financial , technical and human resource , then the police and judiciary be simply lag far behind them and we still have a long way to go before we achieve a common area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
we must pull out all the stop so as to improve the way in which cross-border police work be organise and make criminal prosecution more efficient than it have be hitherto . </s>
we may have come a long way in term of police work in that we have Europol , analysis and coordination activity , and joint investigative group , but the judiciary be lag @card@ year behind police cooperation accord to the expert . </s>
that be the case , the act that have be put forward here , which afford judicial cooperation - also in matter of criminal law - represent progress , a step in the right direction . </s>
whilst it may warrant some criticism , we can undoubtedly note to our satisfaction how crucial it be that request for mutual assistance in matter of criminal law no longer go through prescribed ministerial channel , rather they be exchange directly , that people hold in custody can be hand over , and that joint investigative group can be set up . </s>
that be a whole host of measure that will help us to proceed efficiently and on a joint basis in matter of criminal law . </s>
Ana Palacio have already make critical comment in connection with telecommunication interception and hearing by video conference . </s>
all in all though , this report be a positive step towards the common area of justice we be seek to achieve . </s>
. </s>
( applause ) Mr President , I too agree that the convention that we be examine be but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom , security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become . </s>
it be today an area for the free movement of good and person , in which there be no frontier to crime , but in which significant barrier still exist to those whose duty it be to combat crime . </s>
a small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one , for which the Committee on Citizens ' freedom and right , Justice and Home Affairs have quite correctly want to prescribe further restriction and guarantee in the name of the defence of the fundamental right of the individual that be in force in the Member States and in the Union itself , even if these be not yet enshrine in a European Union charter of right , which we hope will soon come into be : just restriction and guarantee because , unfortunately , exist right be , in practice , not always respect by every public authority in every Member State . </s>
certain isolated passage in the Commission 's proposal perhaps err on the side of caution , as be the case when it be maintain that the detainee accuse should be give the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purpose of preliminary enquiry . </s>
I personally find it unacceptable , for example , for Mr Pinochet to be give the option to move to Spain for a confrontation . </s>
or when it be maintain that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link . </s>
these be nevertheless minor flaw , which the rapporteur do not want and which - I hope - will be remedy when this Chamber come to vote . </s>
the rapporteur have make laudable effort , which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him . </s>
the overall result be remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account . </s>
There be , as have already be say , one point still to resolve , which be also the most delicate one : it concern article @card@ of the convention , which relate to the interception of communication originate in one Member State , but which be directly perform by another Member State , without the assistance be request of the state in which the interception be be carry out , something which be now possible thank to the late technology . </s>
this be a highly controversial issue as it constitute a potential source of abuse . </s>
it could be maintain that in overall term the legislation propose be good than nothing , but to the Commission it nevertheless appear insufficient and far from reassure . </s>
it thus merit further reflection which , at a time in which the ambivalent report on ECHELON be evoke shade of Big Brother , should probably go into great detail on the mean and method to be use , on the one hand , to safeguard the right of the individual , and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime . </s>
the objective be thus to achieve , as closely as possible , a fine balance between the fight against organise crime and respect for personal freedom and the dignity of the individual : an objective which now specifically apply not only to the Member States , but also to the Union , which be aspire to become a common area of freedom , justice and security . </s>
this be a distant goal , but be one that can be attain in stage . </s>
the most important thing will be the harmonisation of the law of the Member States , but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward , as it be a step in the right direction . </s>
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement . </s>
it point out some of the serious flaw in this proposal . </s>
the lack of clarity of language be inevitably go to lead to legal uncertainty . </s>
legal certainty be something that be essential in such crucial matter . </s>
because of shoddy draft the convention can be interpret very widely , and it ignore the strict condition which interception be suppose to be subject to under the European convention on Human Rights . </s>
article @card@ allow interception in another Member State without its involvement . </s>
not only should this be delete , the whole interception title should be scrap . </s>
an initiative of the FBI draw up the user requirement which form the basis of the current legislation . </s>
the Council proposal contain those requirement , ENFOPOL @card@ be approve by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report . </s>
now we be be ask to provide the legal base for such interception , and it be the combination of these two document that should be look at . </s>
the requirement propose to allow the authority access to the facility of all service provider , that be , telephone , mobile phone , Internet , etc . </s>
; and give the current extremely shoddy draft , this be open to abuse . </s>
I would also like to ask : give that the user requirement specify that the police have access to all service provider without exception , do this include Parliament 's in-house service ? </s>
be we adopt rule that will allow the police access to our own system on very , very shoddy ground ? </s>
furthermore , in this proposal there be no threshold for serious offence . </s>
this leave it wide open to abuse . </s>
again as regard the reversal of the burden of proof , something which be recognise in international , fundamental law , the presumption of innocence be essential . </s>
that be not guarantee . </s>
neither the preamble nor the body of the text take proper account of the right of the defence , a basic principle of international fundamental right . </s>
this issue be extremely serious . </s>
we be very concern about the direction we be take here without proper public debate within the national parliament or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberty organisation throughout Europe which be extremely concern about these development . </s>
Mr President , I be neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer , but like almost all of us , I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
in that sense , the issue of judicial cooperation in matter of criminal law be important . </s>
What do I understand on read the related text ? </s>
that it be dangerous to rely on the provision make by the Council . </s>
the many contradiction and conflicting view over what Europe be and the many different legal system could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situation . </s>
for example , the situation propose by Article @card@ , to which many speaker have draw attention , where each country , each large country if you will , each country with the technical ability , can enter another country and monitor its telecommunication without even secure the second country 's approval . </s>
in my opinion , the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produce some very interesting work . </s>
it be a pity that this very well construct explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be convey in the telegrammatic five minute he have here today . </s>
nevertheless , it be a move towards protect the right of country , defendant and citizen , a path which I think must be pursue much more completely and much more boldly . </s>
I should like , however , to draw your attention to the fact that all this be take place in a framework in which there be confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law . </s>
a child , a student or a pupil who smoke hashish in one country be deal with in an educational way , while in another country he be treat as a criminal and lock up in the university of crime constitute by the corrective system and the prison . </s>
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matter on that basis ? </s>
for that reason , in conclusion , I believe we should do something , particularly in the area of harmonisation of law , not those relate to organise criminal activity , but those concern punishable activity by the people which be more in the nature of social phenomenon . </s>
on behalf of the TDI Group , I should like to take the opportunity afford by Judge Di Pietro 's report on mutual assistance in criminal matter to refer to a case which be a tragic illustration of the way crime be erode security in Europe . </s>
on @card@ December @card@ , a five year-old boy call Clément be find in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train , cry for his mother who be take him to visit his sick grandmother . </s>
Corinne Caillaux , who have probably be rape , be find with her throat cut and cover in stab wound in the lavatory on the train . </s>
the presumed killer , Sid Ahmed Rezala , be also strongly suspect of have murder the British student Isabel Peake , who be rape and throw out of the train take her to see her parent , and another young woman , Émilie Bazin , who be find dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he live . </s>
Rezala should never have be in France . </s>
he arrive from Algeria at a time when , accord to the authority , immigration have be stop and there be no reason for him to come . </s>
he should never have stay in France , have be report to the transport police more than @card@ time for offence , which should have be enough for him to be expel back to his home country . </s>
he should never have be free because @card@ charge of theft , violence and rape have be bring against him , one of which be for the rape of a minor . </s>
he should never have be able to escape from France , but the officer pursue him have no jurisdiction and European frontier have more hole than a sieve . </s>
he should never have arrive in Spain , where he mug a woman at knifepoint and yet be immediately release by the Spanish authority . </s>
today , thank to the complex network of sexual deviant , he be in Portugal . </s>
Portugal refuse to extradite him on the ground that he would face a long prison sentence in France than that provide for in the Portuguese penal code . </s>
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister , the President-in-Office of the Council , to put a stop to this scandal at once . </s>
I should like to ask the house to wake up , at long last , to the appalling situation of the victim of policy for which the establishment , not the yob , bear full responsibility . </s>
Mr President , this agreement deal with a sensitive issue : cooperation in the field of criminal law . </s>
it be therefore understandable that the Council find it difficult to agree . </s>
successful application of this agreement by the Member States require unanimity within the Council . </s>
only a broadly base agreement make any sense in practice . </s>
this , however , do not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously . </s>
Quite the reverse , in fact . </s>
the Council 's proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law . </s>
the wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromise which do not stand this test . </s>
careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but , above all , by the national parliament , be therefore of key importance . </s>
Mr Di Pietro 's proposal to omit the current Article @card@ regard intercept telecommunication , amongst other thing , be understandable , although very strict . </s>
the text of Article @card@ be ambiguous : he be restrict the activity of the intelligence service but seem to allow interception activity by a Member State in another Member State without the latter 's prior authorisation . </s>
in this way , Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it be doubtful as to whether there be sufficient guarantee to protect the state where interception occur and the citizen within that State . </s>
propose addition , such as repeated reference to the ECHR , the right of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR , add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement . </s>
I be aware of the problem but I think that these could have be clarify by mean of one single change in the text . </s>
the Dutch member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will , however , despite hesitation , not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , this report be very important not only in term of its content but also because it represent an initial step towards the establishment of good relation in judicial cooperation . </s>
this clearly only apply to relation at national level as nothing be mention about the much-discuss European citizenship . </s>
on one hand judicial measure fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminal be also benefit . </s>
pursuant to Article @card@ of the Eu Treaty , the Union 's objective be ' to provide citizen with a high level of safety within an area of freedom , security and justice by develop common action among the Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matter and by prevent and combat racism and xenophobia ' . </s>
the creation of Europol represent one step towards achieve this objective . </s>
however , we must take the next step , which be to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matter in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of create an area of freedom , security and justice . </s>
this draft convention therefore aim to complete and facilitate the application , at Member State level , of pre-exist convention on other legal area . </s>
the intention be to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matter through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental right of the defence and the general principle of human right enshrine in the national law of the Member States and in the European convention on Human Rights . </s>
it be this concern for basic right , freedom and guarantee which have lead us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tap proposal . </s>
we recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue . </s>
as for videoconference , more precise regulation must be establish so that the right of the defence and guarantee of fair trial be safeguard . </s>
the procedural aspect of the legal system must be respect by defend the right ... ( the President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , legislate in criminal matter be often counter , wrongly , with argument of individual freedom and security . </s>
be one secure when freedom be no longer guarantee ? </s>
be one free when security be no longer assure ? </s>
modern criminal law revolve around the quest for a balance , a dialogue between security and freedom . </s>
and this dialogue be open-ended ; it adapt to the demand of the day . </s>
nowadays , certain form of crime be cross-border crime and it be , of course , in the interest of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them . </s>
but the Council 's draft leave a lot to be desire and attract criticism on several count . </s>
first , the form : the draft convention be vague in the extreme , and this be totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society . </s>
it be not just a question of style . </s>
we be take about criminal law here and criminal law have to be interpret by the letter . </s>
then the content : the Council draft fudge the obvious difficulty cause by widely differ legal system , vary practice and a total lack of legal public service standard in certain Member States of the Union . </s>
it make provision in article 9 for prisoner hold in custody to be transfer from one state to another despite the fact that guarantee differ . </s>
I should like to stress this point because it be paramount . </s>
we must not forget that several ten of thousand of people be currently hold in custody in the European Union without have stand trial and that , in some state , custody be abuse and use as a means of extort confession . </s>
it be nothing less than legal torture . </s>
other European country , on the other hand , do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt . </s>
it be this diversity in our criminal policy which we have to address and legislate properly mean look for genuine legal convergence criterion and face up to the reality of prison in Europe , which be often overcrowd place outside the law which be a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves . </s>
Mr President , as you know , all of our country abolish the death penalty year ago , but with nearly a thousand suicide a year in our prison , they have not really abolish it ? </s>
Mr President , co-operation in the field of law be without doubt essential in free market Europe , but it must hinge on the strict respect for those principle which lie at the very heart of our civilisation : the fundamental human right and freedom , lay down in the European convention on the protection of human right and fundamental freedom . </s>
we can but thank the parliamentary committee , which have - via the introduction of numerous amendment - make far-reaching modification aim at provide guarantee to a report which , in its initial format , we do not find at all convincing . </s>
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirm that we always submit amendment not on a personal basis or for personal motive , but in connection with general political concern . </s>
if it be then a question of list the area investigate or research these , they can be find with the rapporteur , among them the author of the report on this convention . </s>
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spare himself the effort of make certain remark . </s>
as I have say , numerous amendment have be incorporate which guarantee the right of the defence - I be think here of the obligation for interception to be request by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team . </s>
in brief , this Parliament want the convention to apply solely to criminal matter ; the restriction on freedom and on fundamental right set out in the convention can but be limit to criminal matter . </s>
we need hard and fast rule . </s>
the Council have behave in an unseemly manner , change tack in mid-course , and be nowhere to be see . </s>
we would , on the other hand , like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attend the debate hold in this Chamber . </s>
as I have say , we need hard and fast rule if we be to have fair trial in Europe - without intrusion from interception , without the illicit use of video conference - because we in Europe should no longer have trial run by magistrate who play politics rather than administer justice , and because punishment should be mete out to the real perpetrator of crime and not to innocent people who someone find inconvenient . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , the draft convention on Mutual Assistance in criminal matter between the Member States of the European Union be approach adoption by the Council . </s>
most say it be about time . </s>
accord to the action plan to combat organise crime adopt by the Council in April @card@ , the work on the draft MLA Convention should have be finalise before the end of @card@ . </s>
more time will pass before the convention actually enter into force , give the fact that this require Member States ' ratification . </s>
even with the new rule introduce by the Treaty of Amsterdam , foresee its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopt the convention , I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this convention . </s>
past experience with ratification of European Union convention in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matter be unfortunately disappointing . </s>
this Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance . </s>
instead it aim at building on try and test mechanism that have be in place for a very long time , such as the one foresee by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of @card@ and the Benelux Treaty . </s>
the draft that the Council have elaborate contain provision on a variety of matter that have be discuss by several member of Parliament . </s>
it be a considerable achievement of the convention that where at all possible request Member States shall comply with the formality and procedure indicate by the request Member States . </s>
this be particularly important with regard to the possibility of use evidence that be obtain in court . </s>
furthermore , request can be make directly between the competent authority without any need to go via central authority . </s>
generally speak , there be two kind of provision : those that create an obligation to render assistance , such as the provision on telephone and video conference , control delivery and on the interception of telecommunication ; and those where no such obligation be create and only a legal framework be provide for Member state that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribe , for example , the provision on joint investigation team , covert investigation and the send and service of procedural document . </s>
the Commission particularly welcome the inclusion of provision that deal with new or modern investigative technique , give their effectiveness in fight the form of crime that be well place to take advantage of the opening of border - organise crime . </s>
it be all too easy to get carry away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigation . </s>
however , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedure must not be forget - the right of defence . </s>
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro , whom I salute for the excellent work he have do in such a short period of time , include the right of defence as one of its main point . </s>
at the present time it be entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those right be respect under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe 's Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . </s>
it remain to be see whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights , work on which have just begin . </s>
we must recognise that Article @card@ concern what be clearly a controversial decision . </s>
the article be carefully craft in Council in very lengthy discussion , in order to ensure that intelligence activity would remain effective and that criminal investigation will be cover . </s>
as far as criminal investigation be concern , for which I be responsible , I take note of the invitation that be address to the Commission and the Council by several member of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis , have regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunication may have as evidence before the court . </s>
the Commission be fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us be not perfect or ideal . </s>
however , we must be realistic . </s>
the text we have be the result of the mixture of the institutional set-up foresee for judicial cooperation in criminal matter under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively . </s>
this be what we have , and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there be shortcoming and what additional step will have to be take . </s>
I be quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial system of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us . </s>
apart from that , the Tampere European Council have already indicate in which direction we , in the Commission , should go . </s>
among the step to be take will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decision and the setting-up of the Euro just project . </s>
the Commission sincerely hope that the European Parliament will support its effort to make progress in these important field . </s>
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you be confront with in the come year . </s>
I be count more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer , as it have be in this case , but also an active player in take the union forward in the fight against crime . </s>
vote II . </s>

( FR ) Madam President , when a Swede , a Spaniard , a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English , linguistic ambiguity will arise . </s>
I therefore propose , in agreement with the rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , that the word ' issue by ' be replace with ' deal with ' throughout Amendment No @card@ . </s>
the word ' issue by ' also need to be add after the word ' transferable security ' . </s>
the amend text will then read , and again I must read it in English , which be the lingua franca of our Parliament : ' transferable security issue by over the counter derivative deal with ' , etc . </s>
we must also ensure that Amendment no @card@ by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil be amend if it be to be adopt , because the same problem will arise . </s>
Mr Goebbels , I be sorry , but I think you be jump the gun ; Amendment No @card@ be an oral amendment propose that the word ' with a high rating base on a recognise rating scale ' be move . </s>
you be ask for the place to be change . </s>
madam President , my apology , I be look at Amendment No @card@ , which logically precede Amendment No @card@ . </s>
but , you be right , we be discuss Amendment No @card@ and here too we have a similar problem . </s>
it be not the establishment but the instrument which should have a high rating . </s>
the text therefore read : ' instrument with a high rating base on a recognise rating scale be subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' . </s>
my apology once again for my mistake . </s>
be there any objection to this oral amendment ? </s>
( Parliament adopt the oral amendment ) ( Parliament adopt the two legislative resolution in two separate vote ) Madam President , I ask for the floor before the sit start in order to say something solely intend for you as President of this House . </s>
we have a procedure for visit to be make to this House to report on certain situation . </s>
I do respect and agree with this procedure , as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone . </s>
however , for the second time in a fortnight these visit have be use to attack individual , political party , include my own , and institution . </s>
I feel that this behaviour , particularly in your presence , be unacceptable and totally repugnant , especially when we be on the point of an electoral campaign . </s>
therefore , particularly out of respect for you , I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this . </s>
I be tell that this be a personal response . </s>
note will be take of it in the Minutes . </s>
madam President , particularly out of respect for you , for myself and for this House , I do not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question . </s>
however , as a Member of this House , as general secretary of a party in the Basque country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain , I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusation make against individual and against party like my own , which have a long democratic tradition , and which have scrupulously respect and defend human right for many year . </s>
madam President , I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human right apparently do not prevent his government from cooperate in Parliament with a political group which not only do not condemn , but collaborate with and encourage , violence against people and property . </s>
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso be ask to take the floor on the same subject . </s>
we be not go to enter into a debate now . </s>
I shall give you the floor for any point of order after the vote . </s>
Report ( A5-0029 / @card@ ) by Mr Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operation in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta ( COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0308 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( CNS ) ) relate to Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ . </s>
( de ) Madam President , Amendments Nos @card@ and @card@ refer to the fact that the Meda programme still apply to Cyprus and Malta . </s>
this be unquestionably the case . </s>
however , since we be concern here with a regulation that be directly connect with the accession strategy , we ought not to get it mix up with the Meda programme in term of the legal aspect . </s>
but , by way of a compromise , and so as to provide a safeguard , I would recommend that the follow sentence in the two amendment : ' know that Malta and Cyprus will participate in the MEDA-facility in the foresee way ' be add as a recital . </s>
if the mover of the motion be in agreement with this , then I would recommend that the House vote on it and adopt it . </s>
this would provide an elegant solution to the problem . </s>
in other word , our rapporteur be propose an oral amendment to add a recital reading : ' whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate ...

on Third Pillar matter such as these convention which be so important for the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice , it be unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent . </s>
I also want to mention the translation problem , of which I will give just one example , as we do not have much time . </s>
correct translation be vital in this subject as it involve very precise legal concept . </s>
Amendment no @card@ in Italian , which be the original version , state that ' il minore deve essere assistito da Una persona di sua Fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno ' . </s>
the term ' legale esterno ' have be translate into French as ' avocat neutre ' . </s>
I have no idea what an ' avocat neutre ' be . </s>
it rather seem like a contradiction in term . </s>
however , in the Spanish version the ' abogado ' have disappear completely . </s>
madam President , you have say several time that this be a very serious problem . </s>
the lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version be produce . </s>
quite , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , this be not the first time and it be indeed most worrying . </s>
we shall address this problem and check all the translation . </s>
madam President , I simply want to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote start , to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important vote on matter of the Third Pillar . </s>
I should like you , Madam President , to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such vote in future . </s>
quite , I be well aware that their absence be highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on . </s>
relate to Amendment no @card@ Madam President , in the phrase which read ' where consent to the transfer be require from the person concern ' , the word ' under the national law of the request or request Member State ' should be add after ' where ' . </s>
( Parliament adopt the legislative resolution ) Madam President , in the heat of the moment I forget to mention that , in my report on the excessive deficit procedure , the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contain a mistake in the Spanish version . </s>

we have encounter several problem in some of the other language , but have not be able to check all of these , and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problem of this type . </s>
thank you , Mrs Frassoni , for your clarification . </s>

I should like to give Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso the floor . </s>
I see that he have leave the House . </s>
we shall therefore go on to the explanation of vote . </s>
explanation of Vote Madam President , I vote in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investment in transferable security because , as I state in this Chamber this morning , I consider it very important that the monies of the citizen of the European union be put to good use . </s>
the vast majority of these citizen be elderly people and pensioner , who want a peaceful retirement and who , after the problem encounter during the course of their work life , have at last find financial peace of mind . </s>
the regulation of investment in transferable security , the vast majority of which be make by elderly pensioner , be thus a major step forward for the European Union . </s>
report by Olle Schmidt ( A5-0025 / @card@ ) . </s>
( SV ) Olle Schmidt 's report be an improvement on the Commission 's proposal . </s>
I be not oppose to update the common minimum regulation enable a collective investment undertake to obtain a so-called Eu passport . </s>
however , I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approve Commissioner Monti 's proposal for minimum taxis on capital . </s>
in its present form , the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital market , in spite of the fact that what be most important be to restrain them . </s>
like the whole of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , I have therefore vote against the proposal to amend Directive no 1 and have abstain from voting on the proposal to amend directive No 2 . </s>
Brok report ( A5-0029 / @card@ ) Madam President , there have recently be much talk of the importance of enlarge the European Union . </s>
we have before us Malta and Cyprus , which be two state keen to become member . </s>
give that the complexity of the procedure have be greatly reduce , I vote in favour not only because this measure address the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union , but also because I believe that this should be take as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged member of the European union as swiftly as possible . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) it be with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta , whose accession be vital to the future of the European union in the Mediterranean . </s>
the aim of this proposal for a regulation be to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta , start in the year @card@ and last for five year ( @card@ ) . </s>
the proposal therefore aim to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire . </s>
this new move follow on from the step take at the Helsinki European Council last December , when it be decide that Malta have make sufficient progress to warrant open bilateral conference in February @card@ , i. e. by the end of this month , in order to commence negotiation on the condition of accession to the Union and the adjustment require . </s>
as far as Cyprus be concern , although the Council state that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union . </s>
it also state that its decision on accession would be make without the above be a precondition , which I welcome . </s>
I have , in fact , always think that insist on a settlement of the present situation , in which one-third of this republic 's territory be occupy by Turkey , before start negotiation with Cyprus be quite unfair . </s>
on a more general note , it be true that the socio-economic situation in these two country be far good than in other candidate country . </s>
however , they have receive technical assistance and financial aid from the European union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire . </s>
until @card@ , this technical assistance and financial aid be provide under the fourth financial protocol ( B7-4011 ) . </s>
both country also qualify for financial aid under the Meda programme ( B7-4012 ) . </s>
during the first and second reading of the @card@ budget , the European Parliament stress that the new ' pre-accession ' head ( B7-0 ) , propose by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget , should not be limit to the candidate country of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extend to Malta and Cyprus . </s>
however , because of the Council 's refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for head 7 ( pre-accession ) in the Financial Perspectives , the European Parliament agree , by way of exception , and I stress that it be by way of exception , that this expenditure should be finance under head 4 ( external action ) of the Financial Perspectives for the year @card@ . </s>
at the same time , the European Parliament create a new head : ' pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean country ' ( B7-04 ) , under which two new article be create for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pend the Commission 's presentation , follow the Helsinki European Council , of the necessary legal base and a review of the ceiling for head 7 of the Financial Perspectives . </s>
this proposal for a regulation be suppose to be one of these legal base ! </s>
. </s>
I welcome Mr Brok 's report support with amendment the Commission 's proposal seek to prepare Cyprus and Malta for Eu membership . </s>
the package will grant around Euro @card@ million in total for the two country in the current year . </s>
it be , however , regrettable that the Commission have eschew multiannual financing and decide instead to allocate fund on a yearly basis . </s>
this be bind to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending . </s>
the funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two island to meet the requirement of the Community ' acquis ' . </s>
give the already advanced state of these two country , compare to other applicant , this should easily allow them to be ' technically and administratively ' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme . </s>
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0020 / @card@ ) . </s>
( FR ) as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term , I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increase protection for our single currency . </s>
the Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeit . </s>
consumer and trader be still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be pass in supermarket , bureau de change and bank and not be notice straight away . </s>
and the fact that coin be to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify . </s>
the European information centre , which be already play a vital role in raise public awareness of the single currency , should step up their campaign to raise public awareness of counterfeit . </s>
on another level , we must ensure that Community and national institution cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeit . </s>
as far as criminal sanction be concern , measure be need to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this be the purpose of the draft framework decision on increase protection by criminal sanction against counterfeit present by the European Parliament . </s>
the purpose of the framework decision be to supplement the provision of the International Convention for the suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of @card@ April @card@ and to facilitate its application by the Member States . </s>
each Member State must take the necessary measure to ensure that the offence set out in the framework decision be punishable . </s>
these offence must be punishable even if they relate to banknote and coin denominate in euros but not yet issue and if they be commit before 1 January @card@ . </s>
this be a basic element of the decision . </s>
I can but support the rapporteur in deplore the fact that the present national currency from which the euro be to take over be not protect . </s>
we must bear in mind that national currency could continue to change hand for another @card@ year ! </s>
they should therefore be protect by criminal sanction against counterfeit once they have be withdraw from circulation . </s>
it would also appear to be in the Union 's interest for all Member States to help protect the euro , especially Sweden , Denmark , the United Kingdom and Greece , which will not be introduce the euro on 1 January @card@ . </s>
although this framework decision be a step in the right direction , it confine itself to increase criminal sanction by harmonise substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standard . </s>
There be still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeit and there be @card@ different national system . </s>
that bring us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law call for by the European Council in Tampere . </s>
. </s>
( da ) Mrs Cederschiöld 's report reflect an extremely peculiar form of logic . </s>
the Eu introduce a common currency . </s>
the risk of counterfeit increase . </s>
counterfeit of the euro be perceive as an offence against the entire Eu ; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State . </s>
the harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standard should not be legitimise against the background of problem of one 's own creation but from consideration of reason and necessity . </s>
There be nothing to indicate that the Member States ' legal principle , legal tradition and carefully tailor legal system should be lose for reason to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeit . </s>
nor , in the light of the international convention of @card@ April @card@ , can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal case . </s>
we be therefore vote against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonise criminal law on such flimsy ground . </s>
instead , the focus should be upon prevent the real problem . </s>
. </s>
I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forger . </s>
when the note and coin come into circulation after 1 January @card@ , everything possible must be do to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro . </s>
Di Pietro report ( A5-0019 / @card@ ) Madam President , as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party , there have be many occasion on which I have state , at the committee stage , that the European Union must intervene in regulate the life of the elderly , and in the measure and rule on pension , as be already the case , in coordination . </s>
similarly , as concern the field of justice and criminal law , which we have discuss today , I believe not only that the different criminal law , juridical and administrative legislative system should be coordinate , but also that we must at last formulate common standard : an offence commit in Italy must also be view as an offence in Great Britain , Spain or elsewhere . </s>
I believe that we , the Parliament of the European Union , who be the elect representative of the citizen , must give sharp impetus to ensure that the European Union provide for the regulation of every facet of the life of its citizen , include that of justice , and that of pension . </s>
. </s>
we vote against this report , because by allow trans-border interception of telecommunication and reverse the burden of proof , the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bug operation in the Eu . </s>
that mean , make a European bug system like the transatlantic spy operation ' Echelon ' perfectly legal . </s>
this Convention will lead to gross abuse of people 's right to privacy . </s>
it be a major threat to civil liberty in Eu . </s>
also the follow point be unacceptable for us : joint investigation team , control delivery , undercover investigation , inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention , lack of respect of the principle of proportionality , lack of democratic guarantee . </s>
resolution on the Commission 's strategic objective for @card@ . </s>
Commissioner Prodi point out that ' Africa be our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the USA and other major country . </s>
I work in Africa @card@ year ago , and it be poor and underdeveloped but the problem be now more catastrophic . </s>
Two million people die of AIDS in Africa last year , approximately @card@ @card@ die in war . </s>
in Zambia @card@ % of teacher have die of AIDS . </s>
in some country child have a good chance of basic education and health care twenty year ago than they have today . </s>
our policy in Africa lack coherence . </s>
There be huge duplication of effort . </s>
furthermore , the cloud of debt remain an obstacle to real development . </s>
it be patently clear that Africa have become the forgotten continent . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) in its communication on its strategic objective for @card@ , the Commission repeat that Europe need to become a ' global actor ' capable of speak with a strong voice in the world . </s>
What should this global actor 's objective be ? </s>
doubtless our citizen would say something along the line of ' to defend the country of Europe well ' , since that be the traditional and primordial purpose of political association . </s>
and yet this phrase be nowhere to be see . </s>
all we find be vague phrase about ' strategic partnership ' and the new prospect for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it . </s>
the omission of this principal objective be highly revealing . </s>
it demonstrate one of the main flaw in the European Union , a little-known , almost always implicit flaw , but one which go a long way towards explain our citizen ' loss of interest . </s>
There be a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year @card@ attach to the strategic guideline . </s>
address the fundamental question of relation with the United States , the Commission mention just one priority : ' we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the dispute in transatlantic trade ' ( page 4 ) . </s>
while we be on the subject , where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interest in the numerous trade conflict under way , one merely find the desire to eliminate conflict , which hardly sound like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner . </s>
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe be integrate . </s>
I think there be three reason for this : 1 ) in their endeavour to transcend the nation state , the European institution have lose touch with the people and , in lose touch with the people , they have become putty in the hand of foreign interest ; 2 ) have lose touch with the people , the man and woman work in these institution have start to become use to reasoning not as the sole champion of the people , but as international official in charge of regulate a global system ; 3 ) integration may afford economy of scale and productivity gain ; but it also cause far more to be lose because , when it break nation , it break subtle expression of solidarity and , with them , the willingness to present a unite front . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction express during the debate . </s>
I do , of course , understand the constraint of the moment and I be prepare to entertain the idea of the risk of failure ... . </s>
however , experience have teach me that , in politics , modest ambition be never the key to success ! </s>
I shall not keep say that I be disappoint , because you need to hope in order to be disappoint ... . </s>
and I have have no hope since the investiture debate . </s>
as for the future , give that the Commission have show itself incapable of take action against fascism in Austria , I be convince that block measure to liberalise the single market be the only way of administer a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the country in the Union . </s>
- ( it ) on behalf of the Italian Communists , I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the content of the document , which be expect to define the strategic guideline for Europe up until the year @card@ . </s>
employment : for many year now , the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment have not be bear out by reality , and yet , despite the fact that it have be prove to be useless , the same recipe be be put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment . </s>
and yet our president be a fine economist . </s>
pension : the document state that , ' Member States must remain responsible for modernise social protection system ' , and yet the Commission itself intervene in the case of Italy , repeatedly call for swift change to the pension system to reduce right and decrease pension payment . </s>
and yet President Prodi himself give firm guidance to the Italian government during those year and be therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifice demand of our fellow citizen and which they make in order to sign up to the euro , and he be aware of the major role play by Italy in European development . </s>
for this very reason , we can agree to cut pension further . </s>
There be an agreement on this issue which provide for a review in @card@ and this must not take place one moment sooner . </s>
What be more , the relevant cost dynamic be completely under control . </s>
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from take this unacceptable ideological approach and make such declaration which create instability and uncertainty among the citizen . </s>
I refer to the case of Italy , not only because the President be very familiar with it , but because Community statistic ( Eurostat ) themselves reveal that not only have Italy 's welfare expenditure - currently @card@ % - be below the Community average ( @card@ % ) since @card@ , but that it have also be well below that of country consider to be do well , such as Germany ( @card@ % ) and France ( @card@ % ) . </s>
Europe 's role : we first need to emphasise that Europe reject war as an instrument for resolve international conflict : only then can we talk of the ' military ' role of the Union . </s>
agriculture and health : we see the issue differently from the Commission : in our view there be no consumer : there be only citizen who want to eat healthy food - product which be not design for competitiveness but health , quality and respect for the environment . </s>
moreover , these be factor which create employment . </s>
- ( de ) the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , present an impressive programme yesterday and elucidate it with additional comment . </s>
we be still talk declaration of intent , which must be follow up with deed . </s>
the commitment display by the President of the Commission give us no reason to believe , at the present time , that these deed might fail to materialise . </s>
we be also in the President 's debt for adopt an appropriate stance in relation to what be go on the home political front in Austria . </s>
mind you , although I try to follow his speech attentively yesterday , I may have miss something . </s>
the President have recently set out his position vis-à-vis Austria in connection with the safeguard of Eu fundamental value . </s>
however , I do not hear anything say about the happening in Spain : not only have there be no happening of this kind in Austria , I can tell you for sure that there will not be any in the future , indeed it would be unthinkable in a democratic Austria . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the propose action and programme present by Mr Prodi be vague in the extreme and the social question be miss yet again . </s>
in fact , the word seem to have be banish from the Commission 's vocabulary , whereas liberal and American reference abound . </s>
Mr Prodi revert to the contested concept of ' governance ' ; contest because it favour state intervention over a proper work democracy and refer to the notion as define by the IMF , whose ideological agenda be predicate solely on liberalism and monetarism . </s>
the shift in meaning be not just semantic ... the only logical thing to do on read this document be to pursue the mass market and generalise deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizen hope for . </s>
Mr Prodi talk solely of ' mechanism ' and ' structure ' and fail to set out a single balanced project which respond to the aspiration of our people . </s>
enlargement appear to be an end in itself , but unless decision be make on a social policy , a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union , the Europe bequeath to us at the end of Mr Prodi 's presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalise globalisation , rather than the community of destiny which we hope for . </s>
finally , Mr Prodi 's complacency towards the Austrian government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol ( which in no way oblige him to send a message of congratulations ) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the European Union be flaunt its unbridled expansionist ambition . </s>
the Commission 's objective for the next five year be to become a ' global actor ' by showing ' genuine leadership on the world stage ' . </s>
the nature of the Eu have not change . </s>
since the beginning it have serve the interest of a few dozen large financial and industrial group and their pressure group . </s>
but the Prodi Commission now want to transform the Eu so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States , which it also see as its future competitor and rival . </s>
this new imperial policy advocate reorganising European and national institution , strengthen the power of the state , increase competition , establish a European army and redistribute financial resource . </s>
even daring to refer to the defence of a ' European social model ' be a shamefaced lie because the more the Eu combat the United States , the more it become its clone . </s>
we shall vote against these objective , because we be fight against this policy both in Parliament and on the street . </s>
a European charter of fundamental right would be the only ray of light in this policy but , yet again , there be no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically . </s>
we abstain from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the follow reason . </s>
firstly , the motion do not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priority and commitment indicate in the Commission 's programme . </s>
secondly , in term of the definition of priority for the next five year , we consider that the main question to be consider by the Commission be its role in interinstitutional relation within the Eu which neither the programme nor the motion mention . </s>
in our opinion , the Commission 's role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative be return by the government of the Member States follow the Santer Commission scandal . </s>
this be very positive as this be how the national parliament , on which the government depend , will continue to show that their democratic mandate be indispensable to European construction . </s>
the truth be that the European Parliament be still fail to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which be determine not to think about Europe , as demonstrate by the low turnout in the recent election . </s>
the mechanism use in the cooperation between the government of the Member States must therefore be reinforce and make more coherent , more transparent and more democratic . </s>
we welcome the effort of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council . </s>
however , the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanism , particularly by create a Council of Ministers for Europe which , by itself and in coordination with the other European institution , can assume the responsibility for transform the political decision of the European council into specific action . </s>

back in @card@ , the Joint Assembly pass an initial resolution , in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet be closely involve , express its alarm at the foreseeable consequence of the Uruguay Round , which contradict the very principle of Community preference which be fundamental to this cooperation . </s>
these fear have be take shape over the last two year and the banana row be the clear expression of them . </s>
the develop country be ask to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade , despite their vulnerable economy . </s>
although Mr Corrie 's report roundly condemn this situation and reaffirm the Joint Assembly 's attachment to the Lomé model , he fail to highlight properly a second problem which , to tell the truth , be also the result of the free-trade error , namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreement sign by the European Union . </s>
the cooperation agreement with South Africa be a prime example . </s>
the Council approve the agreement negotiate by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section , namely agriculture , have not be finalise . </s>
as Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly say in his intervention yesterday and in his propose amendment , one wonder exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represent . </s>
it be most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appear to be take shape . </s>
nor be it possible to support the rapporteur 's call for the European Development Fund to be merge with the Community budget . </s>
we want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State , which be make possible by its intergovernmental nature . </s>
alas , there have be far too many instance of collective aid for which no-one feel responsible be derail and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF . </s>
madam President , I welcome Mr Corrie 's report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly have carry out over the last year . </s>
the report come just after agreement have be reach on the renewal of the exist Lomé Convention , which expire at the end of this month . </s>
the new agreement provide for a development budget of EUR @card@ billion over the next seven year . </s>
it be vital that this money be use to benefit the poor group and individual within the ACP country . </s>
strenuous effort must be make to root out corruption and waste . </s>
civil society must be involve in the planning and implementation of these project . </s>

the effect of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matter in the sub-Saharan region be be neutralise or reverse . </s>
from the datum which I be refer to today , it be evident that this disease be take a disproportionate toll on the develop country least capable of respond to its wide-ranging impact . </s>
it be clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African continent be link to poverty . </s>
AIDS treatment that may cost $ @card@ @card@ per annum for one person be obviously not affordable by country whose annual health budget may be less than $ 5 per capita . </s>
it be incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what be a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner . </s>
we must primarily ensure that the basic need of the poor people in the country most affect by the AIDS disease be fully meet . </s>
these country include Ethiopia , Lesotho , Mozambique , Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia . </s>

appropriate message about the health effect of AIDS must be deliver to primary school child by teacher who be comfortable with the information that they be try to communicate . </s>
health facility and staff of NGOs need to be support and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patient . </s>
it be essential that these group be able to obtain the limited resource they require to be effective . </s>
at a more central level , there be a need for more effective co-ordination between government donor , international NGOs , indigenous NGOs and private sector initiative so that scarce resource be not waste . </s>

on a separate matter altogether , I would like to support Cuba 's membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé convention which will shortly be agree between the European Union and African , Caribbean and Pacific country . </s>
I know that this be somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime . </s>

. </s>
( FR ) the Lomé Convention , on which the entire structure of relation between the European Union and the @card@ African , Caribbean and Pacific country rest , be still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relation . </s>
after year of ' good and loyal service ' it be still the main symbol of effort by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poor country . </s>
it be the humane face of Europe ... and the merit of Mr Corrie 's report be that it highlight the value of this original , proactive development instrument , together with the work carry out by the Joint Assembly . </s>
especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure have be threaten . </s>
the partnership between the European Union and the ACP be negotiate in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium . </s>
I be delighted that reason and generosity triumph over the difficulty , open new prospect for this partnership . </s>
now , more than @card@ year after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south , the tool which have prove its worth and serve its time need to be adapt in order to meet new challenge . </s>
which be why the new 20-year agreement due to be sign in Fiji on @card@ May represent more than the simple renewal of the convention regulate relation between Europe and the ACP . </s>
it should seal their revival . </s>
it brilliantly illustrate the political dimension of a partnership which constitute the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relation . </s>
at a time when the Joint Assembly be open its door ever wide to the elect representative from parliament in the ACP , this dimension must not only be preserve ; above all , it must be encourage . </s>
the Joint Assembly also represent the tribunal before which the country of Europe and the develop country defend their common interest . </s>
after the debacle in Seattle , our duty from now on be to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rule of world trade develop and be use to fight poverty . </s>
the partnership be here to stay and the way be clear for it to be modernise . </s>
first , by promote a trend towards regional meeting of the Joint Assembly , as recommend in the Corrie report , thereby enable work method to be adapt to the new type of cooperation envisage ( regional economic partnership agreement ) . </s>
then , by gear action to micro-projects and make them accessible to the civil society in the southern country and , finally , by call for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba , which all the ACP call for at Nassau and which have now make a formal application . </s>
but we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention , which have enable relation between the European Union and the ACP to become what they be today : a real partnership base on fairness and mutual respect . </s>

the European Union prefer to send its fund to Eastern Europe , the former USSR and Asia , where there be great opportunity for profit . </s>
the ACP-EU agreement make a mockery of democratic principle and the fight against corruption , by spare those who be responsible : when will sanction and control be impose on Total-Elf , which be supply those responsible for the civil war in the Congo ? </s>
or on Shell ? </s>
although the market be present as the only rule which apply to ACP-EU relation , the European Union also plan to police immigration , as article @card@ hint , in order to justify the policy of the European state against illegal immigrant . </s>
we do not accept this agreement , which deprive people of the wherewithal to build society which be independent of the European multinational and bank . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , I be full of praise at the sterling effort of MEPs --some of my Labour colleague among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their effort towards secure a new Lomé Agreement , which will benefit some of the poor country in the world . </s>
few of my constituent will probably be aware that the Eu be the big foreign aid donor in the world . </s>
while other may have the big rocket , the Eu have the deep pocket . </s>
this be something that the Eu can rightly be proud of , and I think we should shout it from the rooftop more often . </s>
the Labour Government 's record in Britain be also a proud one . </s>
Clare Short , MP , be one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government . </s>
Gordon Brown , MP , meanwhile , have lead international effort to relieve crippling level of Third World debt and ensure that Labour 's campaign to reduce poverty do not end at the English Channel . </s>
whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban , Labour 's aim of poverty reduction remain the same . </s>
There be still much to be do , however . </s>
the next great challenge be to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiation that fail to take off last December in Seattle . </s>
it must be a ' development round ' , in which developing country , effectively exclude from previous round , be fully include . </s>
for the good way to reduce world poverty be to help develop country help themselves . </s>
develop country want trade not aid , a help up not a hand-out . </s>
and the good way to help develop country help themselves be to open up world market to allow them to sell their product . </s>
in this way , the power of globalisation can be harness for the good , to benefit the poor not just the wealthy , the many not just the few . </s>
thus , whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown , Labour 's aim of opportunity for all remain the same . </s>
Swoboda report ( A5-0031 / @card@ ) . </s>
( el ) the Eu 's Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , in the form of a joint agreement as establish by Article @card@ of the Eu Treaty , can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic . </s>
in parallel , it can benefit from substantial financial support via the Phare programme . </s>
however , the Eu 's present policy in the Balkans be fragmentary , inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature . </s>
There be different type of agreement or relation or lack of relation - go even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach . </s>
There be no sense of regionality for the Balkans , which would include everyone without exception or vindictiveness . </s>
finally , intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM 's name - which be unfortunately become a long draw out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiate FYROM 's principle within a reasonable time scale , be necessary and useful . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the Commission 's stated desire to strengthen relation between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern : a political entity which respect nation and their sovereignty could no longer postpone send a signal to these state in south-east Europe which history have show no consideration for since the end of the Second World War . </s>
have be crush beneath the heel of triumphant communism , this region have not stop pay the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s . </s>
and yet , under these difficult condition , especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO , some of these genuinely European country have demonstrate a sense of responsibility which entitle them to aspire to join the Community . </s>
in this sense , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia be both an exemplary and a symbolic case . </s>
exemplary because it prove that the Balkan country be not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish be already in a position to meet the standard requirement impose by the European union in stability and association agreement . </s>
symbolic because it reflect well on the Fifteen 's project to see the birth of a policy which be common to the five country in the region ( Bosnia-Herzegovina , Croatia , Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , FYROM and Albania ) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement . </s>
the UEN Group be all the more in favour of send this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leave plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the state . </s>
a satisfactory solution can be find in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the state concern ; but nor can there be any question of block their process of integration because one of them be consider unworthy of such promotion . </s>
the Union be simply do its job when it seek through its cooperation policy to encourage nation to espouse a platform of common value with it , of which democracy and civil liberty be the cornerstone . </s>
it be not its job to subrogate to people in their choice or , fail that , reinvent a new variation on a ' sense of history ' which perceive self-determination as a one-way street . </s>
the Community construction only make sense if it create positive discrimination alone , and the UEN Group hope that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation state in this fully-paid up part of Europe . </s>

we should also like to see this arrangement extend to other area in which , follow the agreement , the European Parliament 's relevant committee will be send material when they ask for it . </s>

however , it constitute real progress in the right direction , which be something we do not wish to obstruct . </s>
( the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at 3 p. m. ) company restructuring in Europe the next item be the Commission statement - company restructuring in Europe . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , industrial change , which can be gradual or sudden , be drive by new technology , worldwide competition or consumer preference . </s>
it have economic implication and an impact on employment and social cohesion , but it also provide major new opportunity when anticipate , prepare for and manage . </s>
the acceleration of technological progress and the increase competitive pressure of globalising market be push company to rapidly adapt their production and company structure . </s>
company must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activity . </s>
sometimes this call for merger of activity . </s>
the Commission be acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult time of change . </s>
we be convince that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change be dialogue at all level and with full and transparent information as its basis . </s>
we have have in the recent past different experience and approach on how to deal with large-scale operation of corporate restructuring , often affect the life of large number of European people . </s>
in some case these operation be prepare well in advance , fully involve worker ' representative , with due care be take to search for the least damaging solution . </s>
where necessary , worker likely to be affect be prepare through employability measure to face the challenge of sudden unemployment . </s>
in other case these operation be launch and implement with less care and concern for those affect . </s>
on every occasion , and as recently as last October in this House , the Commission have highlight the follow basic position . </s>
firstly , decision on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management . </s>
this mean that , when contemplate action likely to lead to serious social consequence , job loss for example , company should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution . </s>
secondly , when dismissal prove to be inevitable , the utmost must be do to reinforce the employability of those concerned . </s>
this require anticipation , timely preparation and careful management of these process . </s>
thirdly , nothing can justify the absence of timely , effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the worker ' and employee ' representative before such operation be launch or publicly announce . </s>
worker involvement be always , and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring , not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operation . </s>
in the end it be also a decisive factor of their success , as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust , dialogue , partnership and solidarity between its different component . </s>
these basic idea meet with a wide consensus in Europe . </s>
this be what intelligent restructuring be about . </s>
it be more and more rare to see company embark on damaging restructuring operation ignore these fundamental concern , as unfortunately be sometimes the case in the past . </s>
we have build a wide range of instrument which meet these concern in recent year in the European Union . </s>
we have set minimum requirement at European level , which all Member States and all company must observe when contemplate job loss , especially when they be massive , or prepare other decision likely to affect worker . </s>
the collective redundancy and transfer of undertaking directive and the European work council directive constitute our legal framework , protect the worker ' right and ensure fair standard in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively . </s>
as regard the national and / or local level of employee involvement , the Commission wish to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employee ' representative before any redundancy be decide or implement , as provide for in the collective redundancy directive and in other national provision . </s>
I wish to recall that it be , in principle , up to national court to deal with possible violation of these rule , if and when they be bring before them by national representative . </s>
however , even when existing rule or arrangement be formally respect this do not mean that management 's attitude be socially irreprehensible . </s>
in fact , the Commission have argue for some time now that the rule we have establish be not sufficient to deal with the challenge of today . </s>
in a world characterise by permanent change and in the context of high level of unemployment , the rule in force seem to us to be outdate as they do not allow or promote the key idea behind our employment strategy and our approach to change , anticipation , risk prevention and employability . </s>
that be why in November @card@ the Commission present a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which have since then receive your strong support . </s>
we thank you for that . </s>
unfortunately , the other branch of the legislative power , the Council , have not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begin work on it . </s>
I hope that this debate contribute to remind Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative . </s>
we have recently hear from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launch . </s>
the forthcoming French Presidency also seem willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserve . </s>
the Commission sincerely hope that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitute , in our view , the most effective answer to the concern raise by case such as the one which bring us here today . </s>
as for the transnational level of employee involvement there be some indication that at least in one case the company may have breach transnational information and consultation agreement which they have conclude with their European workforce . </s>
they may have at least exploit some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force . </s>
the Commission will contact the relevant national authority to check this . </s>
in any case , I wish to say to those who believe that their right in that respect be ignore that adequate mean of enforcement and redress be available to them , notably through relevant national jurisdictional instance . </s>
the Commission be aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive . </s>
as recognise in the report , which we will adopt in the forthcoming week , we accept that the directive contain some loophole . </s>
nevertheless , as my colleague , Commissioner Diamantopoulou have already underline on other occasion , when decide whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different consideration must be take into account . </s>
first , any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on exist agreement , unless the fundamental principle of respect the autonomy of the negotiate party no longer apply . </s>
secondly , an immediate revision would make thing much more complicate as regard progress in respect of the other pend dossier in this field like European company statute and the national information and consultation proposal . </s>
the successful outcome of these other dossier could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problem identify above . </s>
that be why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossier and follow a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive . </s>
action be not limit to legislation . </s>
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission be also develop the recommendation of the Lillehammer Report by prepare the set up of a European observatory on industrial change . </s>
we be also develop another suggestion of that expert group , the Managing Change Report . </s>
let me finish by address some of the other concern express in the draft resolution submit to this House . </s>
as for the enforcement of the link between competition policy and social policy , let me remind you that there be a provision in the merger regulation which enable worker ' representative to be hear by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure . </s>
generally speak , we recognise the need for proper consideration to be give in different instance to all aspect surround these kind of operation , include their effect in term of employment . </s>
as an example of this I mention that public authority , notably the Commission , have already take measure through guideline on national regional aid that come into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remain associate with the recipient of regional aid and consequently with the job attach to the investment . </s>
To this end all regional aid be make conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five year . </s>
the same provision be include in the Structural Funds Regulation which mean that it apply to all investment cofinanced by the structural fund . </s>
social cohesion and the interplay of policy at EU-level be the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit . </s>
I know we will be come back to these issue again in the future to see how we can well make sure our policy be adapt and reform to underpin economic and social progress in Europe . </s>
thank you very much Commissioner . </s>
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso , I understand you have a point of order . </s>
if it be a personal statement , would you be prepare to wait until the end of this debate , at which stage I would be happy to call you ? </s>
Mr President , the problem be one of public honour in this Parliament , it be not a personal statement . </s>
this morning , the President of Parliament , Mrs Nicole Fontaine , repeatedly refuse to allow me to make a point of order . </s>
unfortunately , this be not the first time that Madam President have show this inadmissible behaviour towards me . </s>
in do so , Madam President have breach Rule @card@ that state that point of order shall take precedence over all other request to speak . </s>
she have also breach Rule @card@ that give the right to all the member of this House to make observation , observation which in this case refute the remark make by another deputy , Mr Vidal-Quadras . </s>
this partisan behaviour of our president should be criticise most firmly . </s>
I will willingly accept Madam President 's apology any time . </s>
thank you for your statement . </s>
we will certainly make sure that the President be inform of your statement . </s>
I can assure you that as far as I be aware the President never like to have a debate on issue in the middle of a vote . </s>
therefore the House be probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage . </s>
but thank you for your remark . </s>
Mr President , I welcome Commissioner Liikanen 's word , and I be contribute to the debate - we be all contribute to the debate - because , although the subject be broad in scope , it also concern a specific fact . </s>
the subject in question be of great political and social importance . </s>
free enterprise , free movement and free competition be essential pillar of the political and economic structure of the European Union . </s>
company restructuring be part of the principle of free determination of investment , and must therefore be defend . </s>
however , all too often we witness event which be in stark contrast with these principle . </s>
today , we be witness one of these case , which , on the surface , may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry , but which , if it be allow to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union , will become an unwritten rule which will cause problem for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole . </s>
an American company - Goodyear - with production site in Italy , Germany and England , be review its production and relocation , justifiably , in its own view . </s>
however , it seem to be do it without observe the relevant Community legislation , for it be certainly not give reasonable notice to employee or heed the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finance . </s>
in Italy , Commissioner Liikanen , Goodyear be not carry out restructuring but close a plant whose production cover @card@ % of the market and which Goodyear itself define as , ' have the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plant ' , a plant which be open with a total of EUR @card@ million of European capital . </s>
no notice be give of the closure , and no intention be show of discuss the fate of the plant or its worker , despite the fact that the public fund invest in that plant make it much more public than private . </s>
it would be a serious matter if every non-European company be to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket , you do not have to pay for cooperation , you benefit from use the facility and you leave without be accountable to anyone . </s>
Europe have to guarantee every sort of freedom , include freedom to use one 's own money for the purpose of one 's own freedom and not to let other use it at will , other who make demand and then , when the break be make , refuse even to discuss the term of the break , despite the fact that this be a break which have be declare unilaterally . </s>
just now , Commissioner Liikanen be talk of restructuring which must not be uninformed . </s>
sadly , in this case , he have not take into account those who be affect and seem not to have consider those carry out the restructuring . </s>
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it be not easy to take a matter to a national court . </s>
of course , it be always possible , but when job have be lose and factory close down , the idea of go to Court when proceeding be as lengthy as they be in Italy be not very reassuring . </s>
Commissioner Liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention . </s>
as Parliament , we be , of course , expect to be able to contribute to the resolution you mention - we be ready and wait - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this , which can on no account be allow to reach its conclusion and be forget , as have almost happen already . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , as the Group of the Party of European Socialists , we have table a compromise resolution together with the other group of the left , the Greens and the Gue as we want to highlight and condemn the more striking , negative aspect of the behaviour of the company discuss in the resolution , ABB-Alsthom and Goodyear Dunlop . </s>
the Goodyear case be not localise and limit to the industry in question : it concern a thousand family who have lose their job overnight , and be leave without income or prospect for the future . </s>
the case we be discuss today , like many other we have discuss here - and I fear they will not be the last - as you , Commissioner , remind us , provide us with the opportunity to discuss the imperative need to supplement European legislation . </s>
an example be the directive on the information and consultation of worker which you mention , that have be await a solution for year and upon which the European Parliament give its opinion very clearly in April last year . </s>
I be also refer to the importance of reinforce European legislation across the board by revise existing directive . </s>
I believe that the European Union and the Commission must ask the Council and the Member States to consider the procedure for implement these directive in the different States as well . </s>
Italy be no exception - it be not one of the most advanced state when it come to implement directive - but there be many country where the directive , which , in any case , only lie down minimum right , be hardly implement at all . </s>
this make it possible for company to relocate , even within the European Union , from one country to another where directive be less strictly apply , company have great benefit and worker be less well protect . </s>
and the result of this be social dump . </s>
therefore , we must keep tab on the application of these directive and reinforce European coordination . </s>
All this confirm our conviction that something like sanction , which we reiterate be very important when we give our opinion on the information and consultation directive last year , can on no account be abandon . </s>
otherwise , I believe that the case we be discuss today will multiply constantly , and that , one day , the European Union will have no control over them , particularly with regard to competition and change-inducing technology , and this will contribute to high unemployment and weaken social cohesion . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , for the second time within the space of four month , we find ourselves debate the restructuring of company in Europe . </s>
this be - as it be the first time round - spark off by the reorganisation of large company , which be link to a drop in employment . </s>
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group be against any political interference in company , in term of both finance and management . </s>
our task be to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it be observe . </s>
it appear that Goodyear in Italy receive Italian and European subsidy to the tune of approximately EUR @card@ million . </s>
the company go under despite this . </s>
this go to show that job can be buy . </s>
the market be a law unto itself . </s>
as such , state aid cost the government twice : first in subsidy and then in unemployment benefit . </s>
surely this can be the role of your , my and the citizen ' tax money ? </s>
All this , of course , do not mean that our Group do not share the concern of the Italian member regard the effect of the closure on the region concern . </s>
My Group be also oppose in principle to the naming of specific company in this resolution , for two reason : firstly because this create selective responsibility . </s>
a company be pillory one day and not the next . </s>
why should this be the case ? </s>
Michelin cause a great stir . </s>
but I do not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM be discuss , where , similarly , a great number of European employee be involve . </s>
secondly , this be not fair towards employee of other company where reorganisations also take place and where it hurt too . </s>
My Group have sign a joint resolution with Epp and UEN , in which , however , we make it clear right from the outset that we be against the naming of company name . </s>
this be why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 . </s>
if these paragraph be nonetheless adopt , my Group will abstain from the final vote . </s>
I do hope that this will not be necessary . </s>
Mr President , once again we be be force by topical social issue to debate and take a stance on the restructuring plan of major European group . </s>
Everything have already be say on this subject . </s>
for some of us , everything have already be say on the freedom or quasi-divine right of company and for other , with whom I associate , everything have already be say on the intolerable logic of short-term profit , on disdain for worker , on both the individual and collective social consequence , on the impact on territory and on the waste of know-how and skill . </s>
we be all aware of the fact that restructuring , as we know it today , contradict the stated objective of the European union on employment and social and territorial cohesion on all count . </s>
under these circumstance , what be important today for us , as European member of Parliament , when we come to the vote , be not yet again to declaim a few general point , however emotional ; in my view , this would reinforce the already widespread idea that the institution be impotent ; what be important be that we use every mean available in the European institution to bring our stated priority objective to bear on the specific case of the merger of ABB-Alsthom and the closure of the Goodyear site in Italy and draw all the relevant conclusion . </s>
from this point of view , what can we do ? </s>
first , draft a very accurate report on the implementation of the collective redundancy and European work council directive and use all the pressure , warning and sanction need in order to ensure that they be apply to the letter . </s>
it be obvious nowadays that the management of large group be use every subterfuge they can to avoid transparent information and negotiation with their worker . </s>
we must not permit that . </s>
To claim , as ABB-Alsthom do , that it be too early for talk before the merger and too late after it , because the representative no longer have the credential , be inadmissible . </s>
basically , it be patently hi-jacking the spirit of the European work council directive . </s>
we must strengthen our legislation in order to close these loophole ; we must reform it and guarantee worker new right , especially the right to contest the economic justification for redundancy . </s>
we must also review the criterion on which merger between group be authorise . </s>
What do the Commission , and by extension what do we look like , from the point of view of the worker and from the point of view of the social consequence , when the Commission authorise a merger as questionable as that of ABB-Alsthom ? </s>
it simply look like it be involve in a cover-up . </s>
and if all Community policy be to promote employment and cohesion , how be it that the Commission can forego such an investigation when decide whether or not to authorise a merger ? </s>
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission 's strategic objective for @card@ both talk of full employment for which two essential condition be require . </s>
the first be to create new job for young people enter the labour market and the second be not to lose job . </s>
yet the current situation in Europe provide us with clear example of how job be be destroy , particularly , and most seriously , by company which be make huge profit . </s>
in the past , worker be ask to show their solidarity with company in order to ensure their survival . </s>
now the company be make huge profit but be also make worker redundant . </s>
example have be give in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleague will give example for Italy . </s>
There be also another hidden way of make worker redundant , as practise for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term ' externalise ' . </s>
note that sensitive word like ' redundancy ' be not use . </s>
externalise service by subcontract these to contract company result in stable and permanent job be turn into precarious job without union or social right . </s>
this be just an underhand way of make worker redundant . </s>
commissioner , if the European institution really believe in what they say about full employment , they must take clear step to secure this . </s>
they must revise the directive in order to guarantee the participation of worker in these negotiation . </s>
they must revise the directive on collective redundancy , reduce the work day , link European subsidy to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clause in the international agreement sign by the European Union . </s>
Mr President , sadly , once again , Parliament be have to discuss the restructuring of company in Europe . </s>
yet again , worker be likely to lose their job . </s>
this time , I be refer to the worker of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina . </s>
as have already be point out , in one month 's time , @card@ people and as many family could be deprive of their sole source of income . </s>
despite the commitment they have show to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which have make the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these worker be likely to be remove from the production cycle , while Goodyear , after year of benefit from state and European subsidy , be totally free to walk out . </s>
I do not think this be at all fair , either to the worker at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizen whose taxis have , albeit indirectly , enable Goodyear to benefit from the state aid I have just mention . </s>
the European Commission and the Council must , at last , assume all the necessary responsibility , both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of worker and with regard to Community and national aid , which must only be grant to company who undertake to establish long-term agreement to protect job . </s>
today , we ask the Commission to start by protect the worker at Goodyear in Cisterna , and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible , thereby ensure the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I would also like to remind the house that there be very little time available , and therefore that any measure - include those already cite by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate , timely effect . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , as far as restructuring go , there be no doubt that European company must adapt so that they be well place to face new challenge or go under . </s>
we be well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring be to rationalise corporate management . </s>
although it be laudable from an economic point of view to make structural change in order to be more competitive and win market share , this approach may be reprehensible if it be make at the request of financier , often shareholder , with the sole unavowed aim of increase the financial standing of the company in order to raise profit which they can then withdraw from the company . </s>
the various recent announcement refer to by previous speaker , be they by Michelin or Goodyear , be symptomatic in this respect . </s>
rationalise management and improve profit should , in my view , serve the company and hence its employee first and foremost , and any financial benefit should follow . </s>
however , what we witness today be the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regroup and relocation , with all the familiar consequence , both on the quality of product and at the social level , especially in term of unemployment , difficult work condition and increase flexibility : consequence which have a drastic effect at the human level , especially on the family unit . </s>
There be a very real risk of see a two-headed monster emerge on this planet , with poor country provide the labour and rich country provide the capital . </s>
surely Europe should act as a safeguard , maintain a certain equilibrium between increase profitability and social welfare ? </s>
we must not forget that it be human resource which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good result . </s>
finally , allow me to remind you that the third letter of the Edd Group to which I belong stand for ' difference ' . </s>
Europe have a duty to make its voice hear as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all cost . </s>
without doubt , the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring . </s>
Mr President , last month in the UK , in a region that neighbour mine , the Michelin Group announce significant redundancy at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increase global competitiveness in the world market for tyre . </s>
I , like all member present , be sadden by this loss of job . </s>
equally , I be sadden by the announcement make by Goodyear that have prompt this resolution . </s>
but I doubt very much indeed whether a European work council would have be able to change this company 's decision . </s>
this House be very good at produce resolution and legislation and we sometimes , in this institution , forget that Europe can survive alone . </s>
we need multinational company to base their business within our continent . </s>
in my few month here , I have find it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage business to grow within the Eu , nearly every resolution we pass actually encourage business to leave . </s>
in our last plenary part-session in Brussels we vote on the end-of-life vehicle directive and manage to make the legislation retrospective , add huge cost for the European motor manufacturer that they could not have predict . </s>
Two day later , Toyota , which employ several thousand people in my region , state that this directive would not only increase the cost of car but could well also mean redundancy in their Derbyshire plant . </s>
in a world where surely less regulation be the key , we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and cost on business and that they will stay within the European Union , untempted by other location elsewhere where there be few burden . </s>
we MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of create them . </s>
take a large successful business , add European regulation , and within month you have create a small one . </s>
perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here . </s>
Mr President , I will not use my speak time by go into the individual case debate here today . </s>
in this respect , I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel 's view that we can talk about these in detail . </s>
but maybe next time , we ought to discuss CORUS , the merger which have now take place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel . </s>
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wide context and examine the link between policy in the field of company merger within the European union and policy in other field . </s>
in this light , I be please that Mr Liikanen be present and we do not only have to hold this discussion , where the interest of employee be concern , with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the commissioner who be active in other field . </s>
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission 's policy from these different vantage point , unlike my predecessor , who hold the belief that there be no need for rule . </s>
we need to gain an insight into what company be like now . </s>
at present , we be witness a number of large merger between company which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and company with a Rhineland tradition . </s>
What remain of the concept of what a company should be like now be naturally very relevant : whether it be merely the property and toy of shareholder , or whether it be a more broadly base stakeholder society , which be mean to guarantee continuity for staff , consumer , supplier and the local population and have , in addition , a social function . </s>
as such , I would like to ask these various Commission directorate and these various commissioner to provide a wide vision regard corporate government . </s>
I think that it would also fit in well with the plan which have be present over the past couple of day on good government in Europe , as company policy form part of this . </s>
the government be talk to trade union and Goodyear delegate in Italy as well , in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopt by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina , an area of Central Italy which have already be affect by other restructuring operation . </s>
the closure mean the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand job and hundred of family be abandon to insecurity and sudden poverty . </s>
the Goodyear worker be put up a magnificent fight , in the knowledge that they be defend not only their own interest but the interest of the Goodyear worker in the different European country as well , and there be many of them : France , Germany , the United Kingdom , Poland , Luxembourg and Slovenia . </s>
today , a small delegation of worker be here with us in the gallery , anxious to find out what their future will be , what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinational act solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profit . </s>
the European Union , in all of its aspect , must use all of its power to resolve this and other dispute . </s>
Mr President , earlier this week President Prodi announce that one of the Commission 's strategic objective for the next five year would be to aim for full employment . </s>
he acknowledge that @card@ million Europeans be currently look for work and that unemployment be the main source of poverty and social exclusion . </s>
What be more , the Portuguese Presidency see the fight against unemployment as top priority . </s>
yet , all too often these political priority be invisible in everyday policy . </s>
the Commission 's decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead be a case in point . </s>
the new company have announce its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of make saving . </s>
this global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to @card@ @card@ job . </s>
in my region of the UK in particular the employment consequence of this merger have be severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom have announce that it be cut @card@ job in Britain with @card@ job be lose in Stafford and @card@ in Rugby . </s>
the company 's failure to inform the work council about the proposal for the merger be particularly worry . </s>
it be especially important in the case of large international company where decision be take far from the employee . </s>
point @card@ of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stress the need for consultation , add that this shall apply especially in company have establishment in two or more Member States . </s>
I do not think it be simply a matter of a Community charter . </s>
EU legislation on this issue could not be clear . </s>
the Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decision not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequence . </s>
we need more joined-up policy make on these issue . </s>
What we also need urgently be an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation . </s>
this be the only way of respect Article @card@ of the Treaty . </s>
I welcome the statement make by Commissioner Liikanen , but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have pass on worker ' right be implement rigorously and to ensure that impact assessment on the workforce for propose merger be undertake as a matter of course . </s>
I have receive seven motion for resolution table pursuant to Rule @card@ ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure . </s>
that conclude the debate . </s>
the vote will be take later this evening . </s>
the sit be suspend at @card@ p. m. and resume at @card@ p. M. TOPICAL and URGENT debate the next item be the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance . </s>
racist and xenophobic incident in El Ejido ( Spain ) the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution : B5-0149 / @card@ by Mr Galeote Quecedo and other , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on outbreak of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain ; B5-0159 / @card@ by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on racist and xenophobic incident in El Ejido ( Spain ) ; B5-0162 / @card@ by Mrs Díez González and other , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the outburst of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido ( Spain ) ; B5-0169 / @card@ by Mr Puerta and other , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on outburst of xenophobia in El Ejido ( Spain ) ; B5-0175 / @card@ by Mr Bautista Ojeda and other , on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , on xenophobia-related incident in El Ejido ( Spain ) . </s>
Mr President , I be reassure by the fact that the first three speaker in this debate be intimate with this situation give our African origin . </s>
I must firstly congratulate the group in this House on the high degree of consensus achieve in the motion for a resolution . </s>
I be aware of the effort make by member to avoid use an issue such as this for electoral purpose . </s>
secondly , I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia be xenophobic or racist . </s>
of course this do not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence use by individual or group who deserve to be prosecute firmly and rigorously by the law , and by the law alone . </s>
we should be tackle the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner . </s>
these event , which be unfortunately overshadow the political decision in this area , confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority . </s>
today 's problem can be solve in five year . </s>
they will take a long time , as we be find out . </s>
the legislation of the Member States must be bring into line with the agreement of the government in Tampere , as paragraph 7 of the motion state . </s>
legal immigrant must be integrate socially without any excuse or delay . </s>
furthermore , the labour market must be organise realistically so that job hold by third country national be subject to labour legislation on wage , social security and social protection in term of equality . </s>
this will eradicate the labour exploitation and market in marginalised people , which be result in the event condemn by the motion , and which be the real basis of the current social problem . </s>
Solidarity , dialogue and agreement between local , regional , national and European institution and employer , union and the immigrant community themselves , whose country of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility , be essential . </s>
collaboration with the country of origin on this issue be vital . </s>
in this respect , the action plan approve by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocate a budget . </s>
specifically , I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco . </s>
this be a country with which the European Union have an effective relationship and common interest and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration . </s>
finally , this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increase tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate word and condemnation prompt by such behaviour . </s>
this be a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom , security and justice will be recognise in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , whenever a serious social problem occur , it always have a political basis . </s>
this be true of the disgraceful event which have recently occur in El Ejido . </s>
the proof of this lie in the fact that the group in this House have react and table several motion for resolution . </s>
we all regret the death which have occur and the violent and disproportionate reaction against the immigrant worker . </s>
we all , I believe , agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which be apparent in certain action . </s>
these event certainly have their origin in , among other factor , the absence of a clear immigration policy allow the affected community to live together respectfully and peacefully . </s>
we hope that the event in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeat . </s>
yet it be not enough to regret the situation . </s>
we do not want Africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary . </s>
we must therefore act . </s>
I should like to highlight certain measure which we be try to introduce in another European region affect by immigration - the Canary Islands . </s>
firstly we be create a network of reception centre for minor . </s>
secondly we be conduct a programme of social integration . </s>
thirdly we be carry out education programme on tolerance and respect . </s>
finally we be produce a census of immigrant . </s>
I hope that these measure will help towards ensure compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish act on alien . </s>
in particular they must ensure that people arrive in Europe do not lose their dignity . </s>
Mr President , last week , in the Andalusian town of El Ejido , we see scene which be inappropriate to the European union in the year @card@ . </s>
this be acknowledge by the Commission President , Romano Prodi , on 9 February when he confirm that what have occur in El Ejido go against the very principle of the European Union . </s>
these event have cause us great pain and shame and have awake our fear give the extreme racism , xenophobia and intolerance demonstrate . </s>
it be incomprehensible that way of coexist and ensure mutual respect can be find between two community which be mutually beneficial . </s>
the only way to prevent these event happen again , in a place where there be large community of immigrant worker , be through social integration . </s>
this require a firm economic , political and social commitment from the competent authority . </s>
we be all immigrant . </s>
for generation human being have not always remain within the border of one nation state but have constantly migrate . </s>
geographical mobility be not an invention of the twentieth century and neither be its economic and work-related cause . </s>
we be all immigrant , if not ourselves personally , then through one of our relation or ancestor . </s>
however , instead of produce these event which we be condemn , migration must generate social , cultural and economic enrichment . </s>
What happen in El Ejido be unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union . </s>
we must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outburst of certain inhabitant of El Ejido against immigrant worker in the area . </s>
a whole community should not have be hold responsible , criminalised and attack for one regrettable but isolated incident . </s>
secondly , all the authority must act immediately . </s>
coordination between them be the key to combat this type of xenophobia and racism . </s>
in particular , local authority and mayor have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia , especially when this involve violent and aggressive act against people and their property . </s>
these authority must also help to achieve difficult agreement between the party involve and must not hinder these , as have happen with the mayor in question . </s>
thirdly , the political party must assume direct responsibility for the political action of their public official . </s>
they must prevent any individual action or declaration which be contrary to the principle and value of coexistence and tolerance express by the European Union . </s>
finally , the European Union must be responsible for monitor the application of its principle . </s>
it must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstration in its territory and support and collaborate with national , regional and local authority and non-governmental organisation and association in the application of these principle . </s>
this must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrant resident in the Eu . </s>
Mr President , initially our Group do not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on event which seem to be a local phenomenon . </s>
however , the incident in El Ejido be a symptom of a phenomenon which be present throughout Europe and which deserve our full attention . </s>
we think we have eradicate the terror of intolerance which racism have unleash in Europe . </s>
yet , over the year , social disintegration in Europe have be combine with an increase in migration from surround country and increase awareness of human right to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance . </s>
this be why what seem to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido be actually a worrying symptom which be coincide with the emergence of party like Haider 's . </s>
this House therefore propose the adoption of urgent measure encompass all the relevant factor and to be apply immediately . </s>
we must ensure respect for human right , tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budget and action line for social and health issue . </s>
in this respect we must not forget that the original victim 's attacker be suffer from a mental illness for which he have be inadequately treat . </s>
the current difficulty must also be take into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measure , as indicate previously . </s>
finally , as our Nobel Prize Winner , José Saramago , have say , we be all in each other and as Jesus Christ say , although Saramago disagree with this , we should not just love one another , more importantly , we should respect one another . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , Andalusia be one of the most tolerant and multiracial region of the European Union . </s>
since time immemorial it have welcome all those who have decide to move there and regard them as Andalusians from day one , whether or not they be bear in our region . </s>
therefore , as an MEP , but primarily as an Andalusian , I can feel only sadness , repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist event which have occur and which be foreign to this tolerant community . </s>
yet a worrying situation be apparent . </s>
all decision which be or be not take and all agreement which be or be not negotiate by the Community institution with regard to the economy of the principal sector in disadvantaged area like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incident . </s>
I be refer , for example , to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solution for the fishing industry , part of whose fleet be moor in Almería . </s>
I be also refer to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetable by the Eu which be dominate relation between Almería and Morocco . </s>
I be also refer to the immigration policy of the region , Member States and European Union which , due to action or omission , be lead to a few territory like Almería have to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own . </s>
All these factor have unfortunately be accumulate over time and be now allow those who be cruel , intolerant , racist and destructive , of which all our country have some example , but thankfully a minority , to light the fuse of xenophobia . </s>
Anyone , whether European or not , who live and work in Andalusia , be an Andalusian and deserve our consideration and respect . </s>
the Eu can and must speak out . </s>
for you , the south be Andalusia but for us Andalusians it be Africa . </s>
we must therefore ensure that the Eu provide every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another . </s>
this have not be achieve with the solution propose to date which have quite simply be base on look the other way . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I speak from experience acquire during many visit to El Ejido over the year . </s>
I be therefore aware how the situation be develop . </s>
here in the European Parliament , as in many other institution , we have watch this situation with concern and be beside ourselves when we hear what have happen . </s>
this be because we feel the problem to be ours , as it be . </s>
in El Ejido there be a serious social problem , problem of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which act as the detonator . </s>
these event have also act as a wake-up call to our conscience . </s>
here in this House , in Spain and in many other country , we have all fix on El Ejido . </s>
yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this lead to the adoption of a much more determine attitude to find out what be really happen , not only in El Ejido , but in many other place where this type of problem may be occur at any give moment . </s>
we all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward . </s>
we will not find the guilty party in this House or in many other place . </s>
those responsible for what happen in El Ejido be a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrant . </s>
we must bear in mind that vengeance be not a solution . </s>
these problem can only be solve by close cooperation between all the authority in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there . </s>
this therefore require a determine fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the right of immigrant worker who be legally work in El Ejido and throughout Europe . </s>
Mr President , this resolution express solidarity with the democratic force in Spain fight for human right . </s>
All the Spanish democrat wound by what be happen in their country have our full and complete support . </s>
it be not only immigrant who be the victim of atrocity ; the democratic system in Spain have be hold up to ridicule , despite have demonstrate its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last @card@ year . </s>
employer would be lose without immigrant . </s>
work condition be so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them . </s>
low wage , the lack of housing - some be live in cardboard hut - the lack of access to social service and the de facto system of apartheid be abominable and unacceptable and be not worthy of the respect which every human being deserve . </s>
What happen at El Ejido be the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practice in Europe today . </s>
for four day , the immigrant be collectively hound . </s>
woman and child be beat . </s>
flee from all quarter , hundred of immigrant take refuge on a hill on the outskirt of the town . </s>
we be right to blacklist Haider 's Austria ; but we can allow little local Haiders to practice policy of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination . </s>
What happen in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we be not careful . </s>
we all have a duty to put our own house in order . </s>
I support this proposal for a resolution , especially the point which refer to the application of Article @card@ of the Amsterdam Treaty , and point @card@ of this resolution establish a link between the structural fund allocate and the fight against exclusion . </s>
it would be to our credit be the European Parliament to roundly condemn these event and support all proposal table in order to ensure that the right of immigrant in Spain and throughout the Union be respect . </s>
Mr President , act of racist and xenophobic violence be take hold at the heart of Europe . </s>
everywhere this violence be exacerbate by the spread of extremist movement . </s>
we must take practical step today to put an end to all attack of a physical nature . </s>
no European society can truly flourish when it harbour the risk of see one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other . </s>
have receive a delegation from the Austrian human right association here yesterday and have see what have happen in the province of Almería , it be easy to understand that we could easily have prevent this resurgence of racist hatred . </s>
these violent scene at El Ejido be so similar to archive picture of Alabama in the 1950s , when the KKK terrify the black population , that it be hard to tell them apart . </s>
they also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s , when the Nazis be persecute the Jews . </s>
without wish to lump everything together hysterically , because each period be different , we have fail to learn the lesson of history . </s>
that be my conclusion today . </s>
because this witch hunt which break out in the province of Almería should have be foresee . </s>
it be the result , first and foremost , of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour . </s>
Three annual crop of Moroccan and African worker support @card@ @card@ people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million ; and yet @card@ % of them have no run water in a region where , as we know , the temperature may reach @card@ degree in summer . </s>
we also know that many of them only earn EUR @card@ a month , while their fellow European citizen can earn three time that . </s>
this precarious wage-earning position weaken these immigrant and their family and make them vulnerable . </s>
the irresponsibility of certain elect representative and the barely disguise complicity of the authority have contribute to this racist explosion . </s>
we should counter such act of terror , Mr President , by set up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in prevent other conflict of a similar nature elsewhere . </s>
my fellow Member , Mrs Roure , be right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order . </s>
finally , and I think this be important : why not have the honesty today to relay what be disclose in a recent UN study explain that , if Spain wish to preserve its work , retirement and pension potential , it be no good just give @card@ @card@ immigrant a year legal status ; it need to be prepare to accept @card@ million immigrant between now and the year @card@ ? </s>
we must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember , to recall the date in history when our country teeter on the brink of horror . </s>
we need to educate our child on these matter and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepare to accept many more immigrant in year to come . </s>
it just remain for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday . </s>
we must take to the street of Europe to protest against these alliance with extremist which be a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray . </s>
Mr President , since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the European Union have have responsibility for combat racism and xenophobia . </s>
Two type of measure be require for this purpose . </s>
the first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration . </s>
with regard to the first , the Commission have send us a series of proposal , contain in two directive and an action plan , which aim to apply the follow decision take by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere . </s>
this state that ' the European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country national who reside legally on the territory of its Member States . </s>
a more vigorous integration policy should aim at grant them right and obligation comparable to those of Eu citizen ' . </s>
this be totally contrary to what we have see and find recently in El Ejido where there be irregularity , labour exploitation and indecent live condition , which have be condemn in the past . </s>
I hope for prompt implementation of the measure to achieve integration . </s>
I also hope that the government which produce such wonderful word in Tampere , include Spain , will work diligently to apply these . </s>
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement make by the Council on immigration . </s>
the only proposal which have be make be for the directive on family reunification . </s>
this be a key issue , as we have see recently in the medium that there be many man on their own in El Ejido . </s>
yet we do not know whether this have be accept by the government . </s>
outside the Community arena , some government be make effort to renew their immigration policy . </s>
this be occur in my country , despite the government , the party in power be the only one which do not like the new law on alien . </s>
the objective of combat racism and xenophobia , explain in the treaty , should be the objective of all European institution and politician . </s>
on @card@ February @card@ the European political party , include the Spanish Popular Party , sign the Charter of European political party for a Non-Racist Society . </s>
this require coherent behaviour , yet local leader of the Popular Party be throw more fuel on the rage fire and boycott the attempt of other institution to put this out . </s>
the party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belong should , accord to the commitment sign in this Charter , act forcefully . </s>
it be only , as state by Mr Hernández Mollar , through unity , responsibility and firmness that El Ejido , Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these event of which we be deeply ashamed . </s>
Mr President , one can but feel disgust and indignation at the scene of lynching , no less , of Moroccan day labourer which take place in El Ejido . </s>
we do not the extent to which far-right commando be to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commando be to blame . </s>
we wish to assure these Moroccan worker that they have our full support - as if be exploit by unscrupulous employer be not enough , they have to suffer this type of aggression . </s>
and if the aggressor include working-class people , all we can say to them be that , in act in this way , they be dig their own grave . </s>
in wage war against people who be as poor as they be , they be only do their own exploiter a favour and prepare a future of oppression for themselves . </s>
but there be some who bear even more responsibility than the thug who wield the iron bar and knife : those who spread racist and xenophobic slander , those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain , Austria , France or elsewhere , sometimes even here in this House , be no well than those who take this stupid , reactionary demagoguery at face value . </s>
the lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentor be the mortal enemy not only of the worker , but of society as a whole . </s>
. </s>
I would like to begin by congratulate the honourable Member on the way in which he introduce this extremely important debate . </s>
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemn the dreadful act of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant worker of the region . </s>
we express our support for the family and friend of the victim . </s>
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issue separate statement . </s>
naturally I completely endorse what they have say . </s>
it be especially move to hear the remark from member of Parliament who come from the region about what have happen , uncharacteristically , in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well . </s>
racist and xenophobic act be wholly unacceptable within our Community , wherever they take place . </s>
they fly in the face of the very principle on which - as Mr Havel say yesterday - the European Union be found : principle of liberty , democracy and respect for human right . </s>
of course progress have be make in recent year but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia be regard as completely beyond the pale , completely unacceptable , while at the same time we deal very robustly with incident such as the one we be discuss this afternoon . </s>
we need , in our judgement , to focus on a package of measure include : first , the introduction of effective , anti-discrimination legislation at Union level ; second , implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the national of non-Member States to promote , in practical term , the integration of the immigrant population in Member States ' society ; third , the introduction of measure to combat social exclusion . </s>
the European Union have already lay the basis for Community legislation on combat discrimination on the ground of race . </s>
the insertion of Article @card@ , which be refer to during the debate , deal with non-discrimination in the Treaty establish the European Community , be one of the most significant change of the last revision of the treaty . </s>
since the Treaty of Amsterdam come into force the Commission have present a package of proposal for the implementation of Article @card@ include , in particular , a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin . </s>
this proposal be under examination by the Council and the European Parliament . </s>
the Commission hope very much that this stage will soon be complete . </s>
the conclusion of the Tampere special European Council , as Mr Hernandez Mollar say , clearly illustrate the will of the Heads of State and Government as regard the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principle on which it should be base , with particular emphasis on the Union 's policy on the respect and promotion of the right of migrant . </s>
at Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasise the importance of approximate national legislation on condition for admission and residence of third country national base on a share assessment of the economic and demographic development in the Member States as well as the situation in the country of origin . </s>
the European Council also consider it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration . </s>
its objective here be to secure the right of victim of criminal network organise illegal immigration , with particular reference to the right of woman and child . </s>
those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecute with the utmost vigour . </s>
the word that be use about them in Chinese society be ' snake-heads ' . </s>
it seem to me a fitting description of them . </s>
let me also draw attention to the work on draw up a European Union charter on fundamental right , which have now reach the draft stage . </s>
those right be , by definition , universal . </s>
the charter will extend to third country national in Member States even though certain right will be reserve to national of Member States of the Union . </s>
the El Ejido incident be shocking , as several member have say in their speech . </s>
but try to take something positive from them , I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspiration about tolerance , fairness and freedom into real and effective policy that will help to transform the life of all those family and individual in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it , not at some indefinite moment in the future , but here today . </s>
thank you , Commissioner . </s>
the joint debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at 6 p. m. human right the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution : violence between ethnic group in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoner in Serbia , notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina B5-0140 / @card@ by Mr Dupuis and other , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members - mixed group , on the situation in Kosovo ; B5-0141 / @card@ by Mr Schori and other , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the situation in Kosovo ; B5-0150 / @card@ by Mr Oostlander and other , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on Kosovo ; B5-0158 / @card@ by Mr Haarder , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on multi-ethnic violence in Mitrovica , the situation of Kosovar prisoner in Serbia and in particular the case of Flora Brovina ; B5-0170 / @card@ by Mrs Morgantini and other , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the situation in Kosovo and the Albanian political prisoner in Serbia ; B5-0176 / @card@ by Mr Cohn-Bendit and other , on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , on the situation in Kosovo and the Albanian political prisoner in Serbia ; Press freedom in Angola B5-0148 / @card@ by Mr Dupuis and other , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members - mixed group , on press freedom in Angola ; B5-0151 / @card@ by Mr Cunha and other , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on freedom of expression in Angola ; B5-0160 / @card@ by Mrs Malmström , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on freedom of expression in Angola ; B5-0165 / @card@ by Mr Schori , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on freedom of expression , independence of the medium and due process in Angola ; B5-0166 / @card@ by Mr Queiró , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on Angola ; B5-0178 / @card@ by Mrs Maes and other , on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , on press freedom in Angola ; Native Americans in the US - Dineh B5-0152 / @card@ by Mr Van Hecke and Mrs Grossetête , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the right of the Dineh people , Big Mountain , Arizona , USA ; B5-0157 / @card@ by Mr Sterckx , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the right of the Dineh people , Big Mountain , Arizona , USA ; B5-0163 / @card@ by Mrs Van Brempt , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the right of the Dineh people , Big Mountain , Arizona , USA ; B5-0171 / @card@ by Mr Cossutta and Mr Vinci , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the right of the Dineh people , USA ; B5-0174 / @card@ by Mrs Sörensen , on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , on the right of the Dineh people , Big Mountain , Arizona , USA ; Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky B5-0153 / @card@ by Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the case of the Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky ; B5-0155 / @card@ by Mr Trentin and other , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky ; B5-0156 / @card@ by Mr Maaten , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the fate of a Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky in Chechnya ; B5-0172 / @card@ by Mr Vinci and Mrs Fraisse , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the journalist Andrey Babitsky ; B5-0177 / @card@ by Mrs Schroedter and other , on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance , on the case of Andrey Babitsky and violation of human right in Chechnya ; Cambodia - B5-0154 / @card@ by Mr Morillon and other , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the need for an international trial of the Khmer Rouge ; B5-0161 / @card@ by Mr Maaten and Mr Wiebenga , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the need for an international trial of the Khmer Rouge . </s>
Mr President , before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica , I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease have come over me . </s>
indeed , it be not the first time that we will be debate Kosovo here . </s>
we have adopt resolution in the past but they usually be nothing but a warning shot , as nothing be actually do with them . </s>
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attend . </s>
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten be present , give his power . </s>
but I - and many member with me - also have to note that the Council be consistently absent from this debate . </s>
we need to cooperate with the Council too . </s>
I see that a diplomat from the Council be present who be diligently take note and who will then report to the Council but , for the rest , nothing will get do . </s>
I would insist on change our procedure and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate , so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council . </s>
I think we should give this some think . </s>
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament . </s>
thank you , Mr Staes . </s>
we note your concern and will pass this on through the appropriate channel . </s>
violence between ethnic group in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoner in Serbia , notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina Mr President , Commissioner , we have not sign this compromise motion for a resolution for two reason . </s>
first , because Mr Sakellariou , who be know for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote , vehemently veto it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender . </s>
I have no doubt , and I be sure that you have no doubt , that this be a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance . </s>
the other reason be that this text do not , unfortunately , go very far . </s>
I think that it manage , through a series of clever device , to carefully avoid address the central issue , I. E. the final status of Kosovo . </s>
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia . </s>
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolve the question of the final status of Kosovo . </s>
I also doubt that any of you think that , as thing stand , it be not in Milosevic 's interest to pull out all the stop and destabilise Kosovo , as he be do and as we have see . </s>
finally , I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo . </s>
I also note a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution , which you no doubt overlook . </s>
you condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troop . </s>
I would not want you to be bird of ill omen , but I fear that , by fail to confront the real issue , you will end up be just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen . </s>
on the contrary , I think it be our duty to call on the Commission and the Council , which unfortunately be not present , to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo , of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region , of what happen post-Dayton and , finally , the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be build up in these country and give the European Union a policy in this region . </s>
finally , I would stress that we have be ask the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 @card@ Kosovar prisoner and Mrs Brovina , Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti . </s>
I note that the Union be prepare to lift certain sanction and that we have not see even one of these prisoner release in exchange . </s>
why not ? </s>
Mr President , firstly I would like to take the floor to respond to the verbal attack that Mr Dupuis have just make on me , and this should not be deduct from my allot speaking time . </s>
that be a personal declaration , Mr President , and I would like to add that my Group have assert in a unanimous decision that under no circumstance do we wish to join force with those who intend to sit with Mr Le Pen and the other right-wing extremist in this Parliament , in a compromise resolution or any other form of cooperation . </s>
we will not support a joint resolution ; we will not conduct negotiation with them and we will not recognise their signature on a resolution of this kind . </s>
that be what I want to say about the incident that Mr Dupuis speak of . </s>
together with NATO , Eu Member States wage a war for the sake of Kosovo . </s>
they declare that this war be need to uphold human right . </s>
I do not propose , at this point , to start yet another discussion on the effectiveness of the method at our disposal for deal with crisis . </s>
my fellow delegate be well acquaint with my scepticism as to the legitimacy of military intervention and the effectiveness thereof . </s>
I accept that NATO and the individual Member States be in favour of get involve in an operation of this kind , and that they believe that this be the only option remain to them to put an end to the ever-increase violation of human right and crime perpetrate by the Milosevic regime in Kosovo , and secure a dignified existence for the Albanian people . </s>
intervention do not succeed in prevent a human catastrophe ; Kosovo be destroy , field can be cultivate , production centre be out of action and the economy be in a chaotic state . </s>
Serbia 's development have be set back decade and the people - Serbians and Kosovo Albanian alike - will be traumatise for a long time to come . </s>
but the violation of human right go further , and supporter of the Milosevic regime be not the only one to trample human right underfoot ; sadly , those whom NATO set out to defend be guilty of the same . </s>
dispute have be go on for month . </s>
hundred of Serbs have to leave Kosovo and we have just hear that KFOR soldier be now come under attack as well , along with refugee bus and the like in the vicinity of Mitrovica . </s>
this be only a fraction of the ongoing act of aggression against Serbs , Roma and other minority , which be not just take place in Mitrovica alone . </s>
our commitment to Kosovo oblige us not to look away now either , when there be new violation of human right , irrespective of who initiate them . </s>
otherwise , we will lose all credibility . </s>
this throw up another fundamental question : how effective be international protectorate ? </s>
Can a protectorate be a panacea , or be it not more likely to entrench the ethnic divide within the protected province ? </s>
be it at all realistic to undertake to build a multicultural society in a protectorate follow military intervention ? </s>
I believe we must ask ourselves these question or else we will not be able to find a solution for Kosovo . </s>
and I would like , very briefly , to make some specific and practical proposal that will enable us to arrive at this solution . </s>
the national government must despatch the required international police force to Kosovo with all haste , i. e. immediately . </s>
the donor state must release the promised financial aid so that the international representative actually have the means at their disposal for fulfill their task . </s>
the KPC , the Kosovo Protection Corps , must be investigate follow suspicion that some member be involve in criminal activity , and appropriate step must be take . </s>
finally , there be the demand that this Parliament make in the case of the last resolution : the representative of the UNO Secretary-General must build an administration there that will truly work in Kosovo 's interest . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , Mr Sakellariou , I would not wish to speak for Mr Dupuis but I do not think one should be selective . </s>
if you sign something with Mr Modrow then you could do so with Mr Dupuis and other . </s>
Mr Modrow belong to the Communist Group and be one of the last leader of the DDR . </s>
if you sign something with him then you must also consider whether you be in earnest when you say what you do to Mr Dupuis . </s>
return to urgent matter : unfortunately , as much as we may want to , we will be unable to solve the general problem face Kosovo during today 's urgency debate . </s>
nor be this the right time for us to consider the question put by Mr Dupuis . </s>
we can ask today what be to become of Kosovo . </s>
that be really something we should do in a foreign affair debate . </s>
we be here today to deal with an urgent topic , that of have to discuss , for the second time , a motion on the subject of Albanian Kosovan prisoner in Serbia . </s>
I really have to wonder why we adopt this motion last September . </s>
I have neither read nor hear that the Council have take it to heart . </s>
I really have to wonder if the Council have even a scrap of the least compassion one should feel for one 's fellow human being . </s>
if the representative of the Council have son , brother or father in the prison in Serbia then I feel there would be a more rapid response . </s>
in common with you all , I too have hear the cry for help utter by the mother , wife and daughter of Albanian Kosovans sit in Serbian prison . </s>
To be quite honest , though , not a soul be help them . </s>
I be in Pristina recently and search in vain for three student at the university , whom I have know for year . </s>
I know where they be : they be in Serb prison , yet they have do nothing , I repeat nothing ! </s>
There be no reason for them to be there . </s>
they have not come to anyone 's attention for terrorist or military reason . </s>
I therefore believe that we must take up this cause . </s>
the Albanian doctor , Flora Brovina , who be sentence in Nis on @card@ January , be now in a prison hospital and be extremely ill . </s>
she be sentence because she give assistance as a doctor to all wounded people , irrespective of where they come from . </s>
she be neither a terrorist nor a UCK activist . </s>
but not a soul be help this woman to get out of prison . </s>
I therefore believe that the Council of Ministers have no interest whatsoever in tragedy of this kind . </s>
that be tragic to my mind . </s>
thing have come to a pretty pass when we MEPs pass on the cry for help and none of those in position of responsibility hear them . </s>
the sanction be now slowly be relax . </s>
do it never occur to anyone to make the relaxation of sanction conditional on the Serbian government actually do something about this ? </s>
it seem not . </s>
we should also consider the situation in Mitrovica , and I concede that Mr Sakellariou be absolutely right about this . </s>
it be not just the Serbs that we must demand civilised behaviour from , we must now call upon those to whose aid we go to refrain from avenge terror with terror . </s>
otherwise we will be just as lack in credibility . </s>
and so that be why I believe that we must call upon the people to whom we provide assistance to behave in a truly civilised manner . </s>
Mitrovica must not remain divide . </s>
we have have enough divide city in Europe and still have them . </s>
I believe we must prevent this from happen . </s>
if attack be now be make on KFOR then all I can say be that these be our son and we send them there to help the Albanian and the Serbs and anyone else live in Kosovo . </s>
we be entitle to expect them not to be punish for serve in Kosovo of their volition . </s>
hence I expect everyone there , be they Albanian or Serb , to leave the KFOR troop in peace . </s>
I endorse what Mr Sakellariou have to say . </s>
the international community must send the police force it have be promise them at long last . </s>
a third of this force be there , two third be yet to come , and I believe this be what we need to do . </s>
I would just like to point out that something terrible be go on in Serbia at present . </s>
Mr Seselj , this nationalist , who be actually a war criminal , be obstruct the last vestige of press freedom they have over there . </s>
we must clamp down on this or else we will be unable to receive any accurate information whatsoever from the Serbian people ! </s>
Mr President , what be happen in Mitrovica in Kosovo be appalling and reprehensible . </s>
violence beget violence , and revenge beget revenge . </s>
the police force which have be send out do not have the manpower to stop what be go on . </s>
the Chief Commissioner of Police , Svend Frederiksen , have express his desperation at the fact that he constantly have to make do with less than half the manpower which be agree . </s>
he have few than 2 @card@ officer , and it be agree that there should be nearly 5 @card@ . </s>
the police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence , so that people can believe that it be in a position to stop atrocity . </s>
it should also be large enough to be able to clear up crime and punish those who be guilty of them . </s>
otherwise , there be a danger of people take the law into their own hand . </s>
it be therefore also important that local officer should be train , and the idea be , in fact , that 2 @card@ to 3 @card@ officer should be train . </s>
however , there be still few than @card@ trained police officer to contribute to clear up crime . </s>
a year ago , we do of course see what happen when agreement and resolution which have be make be not follow up . </s>
I be in Kosovo on @card@ October @card@ when the Serbs withdraw . </s>
the agreement be that 1 @card@ OSCE observer should arrive to guarantee the peace . </s>
after a month , however , there be still only a handful of observer . </s>
by Christmas , there be perhaps @card@ and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it have be agree should come be , in fact , in place . </s>
atrocity be not even be record . </s>
then the war come , and the observer be withdraw . </s>
I would therefore ask the Commissioner : can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeat our folly here in Europe ? </s>
Can you not guarantee increase the police presence to 5 @card@ officer and train local officer , who would naturally find it easy to clear up crime than would officer from abroad ? </s>
I might also ask : when do you anticipate that they will be in place ? </s>
and when be more responsibility to be transfer to local democratic authority ? </s>
I mention this last issue because it be the solution we should be embrace as quickly as possible if peace be to have any chance at all . </s>
all who be in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion : it be a tragic , desperate situation where there be a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic group live peacefully side by side . </s>
Mitrovica be a tragic example of this . </s>
before military intervention by NATO , Milosevic 's policy for Kosovo be certainly to be condemn , and the demand of the non-violent force of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar region to be autonomous be justify . </s>
but NATO 's decision for military intervention and the KLA 's support for the armed force have a devastating effect and have reduce Kosovo to a colony , as well as destroy civil infrastructure in Serbia . </s>
today , Kosovo have no adequate strategy for protect minority group , and these include not only Serbs and Roma , but also moderate Albanian who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and be persecute by the extremist in power . </s>
it be useless to talk of the Roma house which have be burn down and the thousand upon thousand of new refugee and the refugee from Krajina , who be now live , barricade in , in Kosovo , abandon by the UNHCR , which itself have be abandon by the donor , while the emergency be still of dramatic proportion . </s>
in the joint resolution , we ask the Council and the Member States to double their effort to ensure respect for minority group and to work towards the creation of democratic structure , give a voice to all those force which still believe in peaceful coexistence . </s>
in this sense , I be in agreement with Mr Sakellariou 's proposal . </s>
another subject be discuss be the release of the Albanian hold in prison , particularly Flora Brovina , a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I meet , together with the Women in Black of Belgrade , during joint attempt to build bridge between woman from different ethnic group . </s>
Flora defend herself , and ask Serbs and Albanian to shake hand . </s>
Flora Brovina 's husband be the guest of Serbian woman in Belgrade . </s>
this be a sign of hope , the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia . </s>
it be not true that Flora Brovina have be abandon . </s>
she might well have be abandon by the large institution , but we , who work in Kosovo and Serbia for many year , be do our utmost to campaign for her release . </s>
I believe that the European Union must do likewise . </s>
the embargo on Serbia must be lift and Serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoner . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack be very emotionally-charged contribution . </s>
What she have say here be completely justify . </s>
There be not one truth in Kosovo , there be several . </s>
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that be bend the truth . </s>
I completely concur with the draft resolution which be before us . </s>
we condemn all violence over there and that be what we need to do , but we can talk about genocide in reverse . </s>
needless to say , the situation in Mitrovica be very dangerous and we all know why . </s>
There be also important economic interest at stake and the whole tragedy surround the Trepca mine also play its part . </s>
we have already talk about the fate of the political prisoner . </s>
There be a great deal of pain , a lot of suffering in Kosovo . </s>
the people be hold demonstration , they be send us e-mails . </s>
they ask us where their child be , their son . </s>
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer . </s>
the case of Flora Brovina be just one of many . </s>
we be right to include this in the draft resolution , but there be hundred , even thousand of Flora Brovinas out there . </s>
I would ask the Commission and the absent council at long last to do something for these political prisoner . </s>
the fact that they be lock up in Serbia also fuel the unrest and violence in Kosovo . </s>
Mr President , first of all I would like to turn to my colleague from Munich , Mr Sakellariou . </s>
I may not always be of the same mind as Mr Dupuis but what I would like to say be that he be a confirm democrat , and hitherto it be customary in this house for people to negotiate with each other . </s>
if that be to change then rule must be lay down , and we must also put a stop to your group , as well as other group , regularly start joint initiative with the group that Mr Modrow belong to , Mr Modrow be the only Member of this House who for decade serve a criminal regime , that of the Berlin Wall murderer , in a prominent capacity . </s>
I would like to make this quite plain to you all , so as to avoid any cross wire . </s>
we must ensure that clear , democratic criterion pertain to a state under the rule of law be then establish . </s>
as to the issue itself , I would like to say that although the Council be rightly criticise for its failure to attend - and I would second this - yesterday , during Question Time , we have a debate with the Council on Kosovo last an hour and ten minute . </s>
the Council behave relatively well but I be ashamed of what this House have to say for , with few exception , all we could talk about be that there be more serious attack and bad human right violation go on in Kosovo today than there be before NATO intervene . </s>
it be even suggest that NATO ought to be bring before the Court of Justice in the Hague . </s>
this be an atrocious way to go on and I simply have to say that it produce a distorted image of the opinion of this House . </s>
I be therefore very please with the motion that have be work out with a large consensus today , for we must get something straight : attack be currently take place , as be unresolved and regrettable incident , but what we do not have , thank God , be the mass expulsion of hundred of thousand or million of people , bring about by state-sanctioned violence . </s>
that be what NATO intervention bring to an end . </s>
that be why NATO do not deserve to go to the Hague , rather this House ought to have award it the Sakharov prise . </s>
I would like to make quite plain that we too must be sure to stand by the commitment we make in this respect . </s>
we assume responsibility for Kosovo , with all the consequence that entail , but of course this mean that in view of the conflict that be take place - and it stand to reason that this should be so - we must see to it that a function civil administration be set up again with all haste . </s>
I would like to lend my express support to Bertel Haarder and other , who say that we must make the building up of police and judicial structure our priority . </s>
we have fail miserably on this front . </s>
the first mistake be that this task be transfer to the UN , which be definitely fail to get to grip with it . </s>
the second mistake be that many States , include the Member States , be not live up to their commitment , particularly those of a financial nature . </s>
we hear about the reconstruction of Kosovo and the Stability Pact , but all of that be very much in keep with the culture of announcement that be very much the ' in thing ' these day . </s>
in other word , million and billion be promise and announce but only a relatively small proportion of this see the light of day . </s>
I also call upon the Commission - and I know that Commissioner Patten be one of the good commissioner we have - to make a huge effort here and ensure that the whole host of announcement make by the States - not the Eu , the individual States that be - actually materialise . </s>
otherwise there will be a steady stream of outrage and attack and any attempt to establish rule of law will come to nought . </s>
as for Serbia and the thousand of abduct Albanian who continue to languish in prison in Yugoslavia , I would like to make the follow point quite plain : it be absolutely scandalous that the Council be begin to lift sanction against rump Yugoslavia , that those on the left of this House be demand that more sanction be lift , yet not one of these motion state that this be inextricably link by way of a condition with the release of political prisoner in Serbia , include Kosovan Albanian . </s>
we must gain in credibility and act clearly and robustly in the interest of democracy and the rule of law . </s>
Mr President , in the present joint draft resolution , paragraph @card@ urge the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their effort so as to make the necessary manpower and resource available for the UN police unit . </s>
this request be fully in line with the vision hold by the special Representative of the UN in Kosovo , Mr Bernard Kouchner . </s>
in order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo , he need , by his own reckoning , at least 6 @card@ foreign police officer . </s>
the UN , however , have pledge to dispatch a police force of 4 @card@ . </s>
To date , however , Mr Kouchner only have about 2 @card@ police troop at his disposal . </s>
moreover , half of this group be from the United States and Germany . </s>
it be logical that the special Representative of the UN in Kosovo be extremely dissatisfy with this situation , especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region . </s>
What be disconcert , however , be Mr Kouchner 's sharp criticism level at the French government these day . </s>
Paris be leave its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policeman , not more than @card@ , in the crisis region . </s>
for this hardly honourable position , Mr Kouchner blame none other than the Minister for Home Affairs , Mr Chevènement . </s>
accord to Mr Kouchner , the Minister be say to have hinder the effort of the French police official on ideological ground . </s>
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegation carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome . </s>
press freedom in Angola Mr President , I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of be accuse of improper publicity . </s>
on the question of Angola , I think that we would achieve an initial result if we have a resolution at long last . </s>
it would be the first in a long time . </s>
so I welcome it as such . </s>
I think that the European Union and the western world in general have have Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now , with no discrimination whatsoever , but corruption be now so rife in Mr dos Santos 's regime that even his long-standing friend be start to find it hard to pretend not to see anything . </s>
so I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter , especially the worry thing which we be discuss , particularly logistic support for the information service by the United States and Great Britain , generalise corruption in the regime link to multinational oil company and numerous other extremely ' spicy ' matter which we need to go into . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the European Parliament have rightly lead the way in promote human right in the European Union . </s>
clearly , government be often more sensitive to the interest of realpolitik and to commercial , geostrategic or economic interest . </s>
we have establish requirement for the country which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirement for the country which we support , because we believe in democracy and its value . </s>
a free press and informed public opinion be the heart and soul of a democracy . </s>
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion . </s>
yet the latter can exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself can exist when journalist be persecute , detain , threaten or put under pressure . </s>
we rightfully condemn the behaviour of UNITA which threaten the peace process in Angola and we use our authority to invite the two side to stop the war and embrace peace . </s>
rightfully and with the full weight of our authority , we condemn the persecution and threat against journalist and we call on the government of Angola to ensure the condition of freedom which be essential to the vital work of journalist in a democratic country and society . </s>
Mr President , how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola ? </s>
human right be be violate consistently and have be for a long period of time , not only by UNITA , but also by the government itself . </s>
the legal proceeding against the journalist fly in the face of every legal principle . </s>
the Angolan government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human right . </s>
additionally , European observer will need to be admit to the trial against the journalist . </s>
Europe , as a major donor , have so far remain too passive with regard to Angola . </s>
if the Angolan government continue to refuse to cooperate , measure will need to be take . </s>
without national reconciliation , reconciliation with Europe be not possible . </s>
this be the case , Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I fully support the motion for a resolution be discuss by this House . </s>
the repression of both Angolan and foreign journalist in Angola be scandalous and so serious that we can let it pass without comment . </s>
however , this motion be inadequate as it actually start from the principle that Angola enjoy rule of law and be only impose certain restriction on journalist and restrain them . </s>
yet this be not the situation . </s>
Angola do not enjoy rule of law . </s>
it be a repressive dictatorship . </s>
it be at war , and a bloody war at that , which be drag on and on . </s>
the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crush and physically eliminate to achieve peace be not one which we can accept . </s>
the repeated appeal make by the Angolan church and , for example , by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki , for new negotiation to try and achieve peace must be support by this House . </s>
as another Member say , we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalist suffer repression in this country . </s>
for example , I have today receive information directly from Rafael Marques , whose situation we be discuss , accord to which two correspondent from Portuguese television have be imprison in Angola . </s>
these case keep occur . </s>
yet the bad part be that there be no way out of the situation in Angola . </s>
the silence of the major power and our own silence be questionable and be benefit a regime of corruption , violence and war . </s>
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola be spread to other part of Africa . </s>
it be impact on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situation in Namibia and Zambia . </s>
it be now also affect the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe have just lose the referendum precisely because he have send troop to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who be beyond salvation . </s>
There be two side in Angola or rather two armed group . </s>
the first be the MPLA , which control the oil profit . </s>
the second be the armed band of Mr Savimbi , which control the diamond profit . </s>
it be oil and diamond which be finance the continuation of the war which , as have be say , be terrible . </s>
it have displace million of people and cause them to go hungry . </s>
it have lead to a critical and tragic situation in Angola . </s>
this war must be stop . </s>
the authority of this House could play an important part if we be to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the motion for a resolution before us today be important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom . </s>
it be also very important because of the broad consensus which have finally be reach after some heated discussion behind the scene . </s>
the problem consider by the motion be a major one but , as have already be touch upon , could be regard as minor in light of the even great problem of the general situation in Angola which be experience a terrible humanitarian disaster . </s>
this situation , as in neighbour former Zaire , be like a fester wound in which it be not clear who be infect whom . </s>
as Mr Soares just say , a truly terrible situation be develop in Angola and in other country in the region . </s>
this be appropriately describe a few week ago as the First World War of Africa , give the involvement of certain country in other . </s>
this be a major issue because the Angolan state and authority must assume their responsibility . </s>
the international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly . </s>
these journalist be professional who be try to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption exist in this regime , for which they be be persecute . </s>
it be clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be establish in Angola . </s>
we have experience this in our own national and European history . </s>
people can only enjoy lasting peace if they be live in a free and pluralist society where everyone be mutually tolerant . </s>
the cause of these journalist be therefore one which we must embrace , although bearing in mind that the problem go much wide and much deep and be much more terrible . </s>
like a previous speaker , I also fully support the appeal which have be make . </s>
we must , some time soon , find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously . </s>
in recent year , the behaviour of UNITA have merit our reservation and criticism but this can be use to excuse the Angolan state for have establish a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption result in the continued suffering of its people . </s>
we must establish dialogue with other force in Angola , be attentive to the appeal of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institution , national reconciliation and new cultural and political force not engage in war . </s>
these can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have be experience for decade . </s>
the people of Angola deserve well . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , it seem as if the world be turn upside down . </s>
journalist be send to prison for simply speak the truth , whilst soldier who be supposedly fight each other exchange smuggle good in the bar in the evening . </s>
this be Angola 's reality . </s>
we be now express our horror concern this war . </s>
Three million victim , two million drive from their home within the country 's border , hundred of thousand drive away across its border , include woman and child . </s>
this be a war which transcend its border . </s>
it be not just UNITA which be to blame . </s>
the government too be responsible for this continuing violence . </s>
this be why we insist that the journalist - more than @card@ be imprison last year - keep speak their mind . </s>
we would , at the same time , like to insist on other thing . </s>
we want the UN embargo , which be suppose to prevent a large proportion of arm and ammunition from be flow across to UNITA airport , to stop . </s>
but what do these sanction mean ? </s>
it be the western world itself which be partly to blame . </s>
it be we , our own people , who keep the war go over there . </s>
the so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame . </s>
this be also the case for the so-called statutory government which be just as guilty , because if this journalist have accuse the President himself of derive benefit from this civil war , then all he be do be voice what the entire world know already and which be be pass on to every tribal district across Africa . </s>
Mr President , we be partly to blame for this war . </s>
we should stop finance this regime and we should certainly stop supply arm for the war . </s>
Mr President , the fact be well-known . </s>
on @card@ December , the Angolan court sentence a correspondent of the Portuguese paper , Expresso , to a year 's imprisonment and a fine of USD @card@ @card@ . </s>
the journalist have bring to light a corruption scandal in the President 's cabinet . </s>
the trial take place behind closed door and the defendant be only allow one witness . </s>
another journalist be threaten with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party . </s>
these be only two example of a trend in Angola to silence any government critic . </s>
over the past year , more than twenty journalist have be arrest for alleged slander or criminal offence against state security . </s>
their only crime be to criticise what human right organisation have be denounce all along , namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundred of million of dollar , pay by the oil company to the Angolan government . </s>
even the British Minister , Peter Hain , concede this recently . </s>
we should ensure that the oil revenue be not use merely to finance the war or to line the pocket of prominent member of government , he tell President dos Santos last month . </s>
but , at the same time , we note that Great Britain and also Portugal be continue to channel military aid to the government . </s>
There be indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regard Angola . </s>
on the basis of a report , the human right organisation Global Witness conclude that the western world be turn a blind eye to the activity of dos Santos because it be fishing for lucrative oil contract . </s>
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary , by make commercial interest subservient to human right , to which so much lip service be be pay . </s>
in my opinion , Angola be a test case . </s>
we should , at any rate , judge the Portuguese Presidency on its action and not on its word . </s>
native Americans in the US - Dineh Mr President , the American leader do not seem to have learn a great deal from the criticism of how they treat the Indians and other indigenous people . </s>
we have to admit that our European sense of responsibility be no more develop in this respect . </s>
once again , an indigenous people 's right of existence be be threaten . </s>
once again , the individuality , dignity and health of a people be be sacrifice to the high economic interest . </s>
once again , we be lose a piece of our planet 's cultural and ecological heritage , despite the many treaty and resolution on human right , on the protection of minority , right of indigenous people , etc . </s>
, which have already be ratify . </s>
if tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperative at all , we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the people concern . </s>
but if we be to believe the environmental movement , even this be vain hope . </s>
There be hardly any reintegration programme for people who have be relocate to the so-called New Lands . </s>
it very much remain to be see whether these New Lands will be safe in term of public health . </s>
it be of key importance that the American authority provide great clarity regard the way in which they be try to offer these family a dignified alternative in keep with a traditional way of life . </s>
it be also important that a debate be hold where the long-term effect of mining in this region be discuss and weigh up in economic , ecological and social term . </s>
the credibility of the industrialise north be at stake . </s>
indeed , what right do we have to demand of develop country that they give their minority a voice , that they protect their valuable natural area and that they respect human right , if it transpire that we be unable to meet these demand in our own country ? </s>
Mr President , as Mr Van Hecke rightly point out , this be about human right and about the right of indigenous people , and Parliament must speak up , especially vis-à-vis good friend , and the United States be a good friend . </s>
this be about the repression of a minority which unfortunately go back a long time . </s>
it be up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people . </s>
so we need to do this . </s>
this be also about respecting a culture , a language , a way of life and a people 's religion , a vulnerable culture which have nearly disappear . </s>
it be important to point this out . </s>
this be why it be necessary - and Mr Van Hecke have already mention this , and this be also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area be reassess . </s>
we have just approve the water directive here in Parliament . </s>
the water which these people need to exist be under threat because the groundwater stratum there be be drill by a mining company , and this be why the traditional way of life of the people who live there be be threaten . </s>
the force relocation scheme must be stop unconditionally . </s>
people should no longer be force to move . </s>
over the past @card@ year , no less than @card@ @card@ people have be force to move and this must stop . </s>
if people need to move at all , they need to be give a viable alternative . </s>
this be not the case here . </s>
the area where the people in question be now be take - and this be also the reason for this resolution - be a polluted area which be economically not suitable . </s>
this be why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authority in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and , if necessary , abandon the scheme altogether . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , this be my maiden speech and I be deliver it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic be human right . </s>
in term of human right , Europe have a very eventful past and this be why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human right . </s>
we need to continue to stand up for these right , especially in our own Member States and society , but also elsewhere . </s>
as Mr Sterckx say , we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which , after all , be close to us in term of democratic value . </s>
the treatment of the Native Americans in many respect fly in the face of the most fundamental human right . </s>
the account of the Dineh Indians be tell . </s>
with the discovery and , certainly , the exploitation of black gold - and , later on , uranium and oil - all possible mean be use to remove these people from their land and to send them to region with few prospect other than poverty , hardship and contamination . </s>
the area in Arizona which be to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians be hit in @card@ by the bad nuclear disaster in US history . </s>
it be now the intention to send the last 4 @card@ Dineh Indians to this land . </s>
the fight of these Indians be be back by more than @card@ NGOs and , thank to the effort of the Belgian ' Mother Earth ' organisation , we be be keep inform of this situation . </s>
this too be characteristic of American society , which hear little about it . </s>
they get heat up about war and genocide on other continent , but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide take place in their own country . </s>
today , the Dineh Indians be face their final fight for their right to land , for their right to dignity and , above all , for their right to their way of life . </s>
There be few of them leave and they be up against a very powerful , economic adversary . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , I endorse the many comment which have be make by the previous speaker , but I would like to emphasise a few thing . </s>
the Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians . </s>
they be face expulsion and have be fight a battle of survival for dozen of year . </s>
they have be live in harrow living condition for year . </s>
the deprive condition in which they be live at the moment be force them to compromise against their good judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercise by the coal industry . </s>
the Relocation Act , which be introduce in @card@ and aim to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation , authorise the relocation of the people . </s>
this relocation be , of course , unacceptable because human right be be violate in economic , social and cultural term . </s>
the Dineh Indians be be move like pawn and , in that way , lose not only their past and the land which be so extremely important to them - the land of their forefather - but also any prospect of work and source of income . </s>
the Relocation Act be push through in Congress by a group represent the coal mining industry . </s>
Congress never question where the people live in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their life . </s>
the population be not allow any input . </s>
this resemble a kind of trade in human being . </s>
the relocation scheme be implement and the Dineh people be move to an area contaminate by uranium . </s>
after the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in @card@ , which result in the spill of @card@ @card@ cubic metre of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonne of pure uranium , this place be one of the world 's most contaminated area . </s>
the United States administration , the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative : either the soil be clean or the Dineh Indians be allocate a proper place where provision be make for all kind of support , be it in the psychological , social , cultural or budgetary field . </s>
it be high time we respect the right of the Indians . </s>
this be why we ask you to vote for this resolution : we in Europe should not be intimidate by American interest which be be push by financial , religious and industrial group . </s>
so let us contact the United States now ! </s>
Mr President , we be currently witness a disturbing development in Russia which the Chechen war be the catalyst for . </s>
we have repeatedly point out in this house that the Chechen war be a particularly bloody form of election campaign and seizure of power for Mr Putin . </s>
when one consider what Mr Putin have do in the few week since his velvet putsch on New Year 's day in Russia , then one will see that not only do he step up the genocidal activity in Chechnya , he also initiate change in Russian domestic policy that cause one to fear the bad . </s>
the Babitsky case illustrate perfectly how press freedom be under serious threat in Russia - which be , after all , a Member of the Council of Europe , indeed its large Member , and which have join force with the European union in a partnership agreement . </s>
Mr Putin say himself that Mr Babitsky be take into custody by the Russian secret service on his order . </s>
he say himself that he make the case a matter for decision at the high level . </s>
he maintain that he have the case in hand . </s>
then we hear that he have allegedly hand this case , which be supposedly a matter for decision at the high level , a Russian citizen that be , over to people that he have declare to be dangerous terrorist . </s>
What kind of state hand its own citizen over to people it deem to be dangerous terrorist ? </s>
then after the initial confusion the Chechens issue a clear denial . </s>
Russian civil right campaigner and the Russian democratic force who stand in opposition be make it quite clear that Mr Babitsky be obviously still in the custody of the FSB . </s>
There be a great deal still to be explain about this case . </s>
this House must urge the Russian government in no uncertain term , firstly to launch an immediate inquiry into what have happen to Mr Babitsky and secondly to intervene in order to secure his release and ensure that press freedom and the rule of law be not compromise still further . </s>
madam President , despite the protest by the international press , we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky , the courageous Russian journalist who have work intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny . </s>
among the contradiction in the account that have be give , there have also be an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky 's fate , by confirm the theory that there be an exchange of prisoner with Chechen fighter which , inter alia , if this do actually take place , would constitute a breach of international law , which certainly do not provide for the involvement of civilian in such circumstance . </s>
nevertheless , we now have more precise information : we know that the act Russian President himself , Mr Vladimir Putin , ask Russian special service to safeguard Andrey Babitsky 's life and freedom . </s>
this be an admission that confirm all our concern and make Parliament 's position on the case all the more appropriate , as it call for a concurrent explanation of other case of journalist who have disappear in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguard of medium coverage of a conflict that have reach unacceptable level of violence . </s>
moreover , we be ask the Russian authority to provide immediate clarification of condition in the so-called detention centre , and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention , maltreatment or kill of civilian be lay themselves open to accusation of crime against humanity . </s>
we would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which do not overlook the issue of human right . </s>
Mr President , in term of human right , there be of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya . </s>
we have receive report from human right organisation say that Russian soldier kill and apparently even execute citizen - I be talk about old man and woman - in Grozny . </s>
citizen be believe to have be burn alive in air-raid shelter . </s>
we insist that these violation of human right be investigate . </s>
despite the pledge make , violation in , for example , Alfanyurt have still not be investigate . </s>
international government organisation and non-governmental organisation must be allow access , and the Union 's general council decide on 6 December @card@ to send representative from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there . </s>
I be , to say the least , curious to know how they be get on . </s>
the fate of Andrey Babitsky , the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty , who be arrest by Russian troop , be a dramatic example of Russian policy . </s>
it contravene Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of @card@ and be a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press . </s>
we want information from the Russian authority as to Mr Babitsky 's whereabouts and his state of health . </s>
Mr President , a journalist be on a fact-finding mission and this call for freedom . </s>
yet he be take hostage and treat as a prisoner of war . </s>
the war in Chechnya , like any war , be a trail of horror . </s>
the filtration camp be camp in which torture , rape and violation be perpetrate : we know that now . </s>
and just what be Mr CFSP do ? </s>
Russia be a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE , it have be invite to G7 and be a client of the IMF and the World Bank . </s>
What be we do about it ? </s>
I do not understand why the power centre of Europe be keep quiet , let thing pass and , by work with the Russians as if nothing be amiss , give its support to the government which be wage this war . </s>
I beg you to intervene . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrate once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia have sink . </s>
the entire Federation be allow itself to be take in by the war propaganda . </s>
a warlord have become President and he have even be describe as a reformer in some western quarter . </s>
journalist , on the other hand , who be simply go about their work in Russia , I. E. endeavour to produce report which be as objective as possible , be be treat like criminal . </s>
the Russian Government appear to have lose its fundamental understanding of what democracy be about and truth appear to have become a threat in its eye . </s>
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rule . </s>
it be simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relation with the Eu if it do not recognise democratic principle . </s>
Mr President , what sort of government hand over one of its own citizen to people whom it itself describe as ' terrorist ' and ' bandit ' ? </s>
without any hesitation , the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs , Vladimir Rushailo , earlier this week confirm the answer to this revealing question . </s>
the victim of this exchange be say to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty , Andrey Babitsky . </s>
I be use the phrase ' be say to be ' on purpose , because official Chechen source be still deny that they would have exchange Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoner of war . </s>
in the meantime , the high Russian authority be cast a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist . </s>
for example , Acting President Vladimir Putin give an assurance last Monday that he have order the country 's security service to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely . </s>
Russia 's new strong man , however , add a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration : ' as far as I be aware , Mr Babitsky already feel free . </s>
' this distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin be not really surprising . </s>
the fact be clear . </s>
Andrey Babitsky be an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin 's ' anti-terrorist ' operation in Chechnya . </s>
hence his disappearance of over one month . </s>
in any case , the Babitsky affair warrant one conclusion : the leader in Moscow can possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizen be a specifically Chechen crime . </s>
this resolution be already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy . </s>
nor be it a mere luxury . </s>
indeed , it be in line with some thirty Russian medium body which yesterday distribute a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge . </s>
Cambodia Mr President , Commissioner , it be because of my experience in the Balkans , when I be there on duty , that I call on you today to support the effort of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations . </s>
I do not think that reconciliation be possible after such murderous tragedy , unless those responsible for start them be bring to trial and sentence . </s>
nor do I think that the people who be their victim can give them a fair trial . </s>
I become convince of this in Sarajevo when I have to negotiate the periodic exchange of prisoner which accompany each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately last , between the party to the conflict . </s>
every time , just as the exchange be about to take place , we find man miss from the meticulously draw up list . </s>
every time , when we ask why , the reply be the same , ' we can release him : he be a war criminal ' . </s>
in the emotion , pain and fury of the agreement , it be impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance . </s>
if we want to help the Cambodian with the task of reconciliation on which they have embark , we need to try and sentence those responsible at the high level and thus exonerate the simple underling and all those who be willingly or forcibly drag along behind them . </s>
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenant to be try and sentence by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality be guarantee by the United Nations . </s>
this will be the only way for the Cambodian to pardon those who simply follow them and to achieve lasting peace . </s>
Mr President , it become know this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition paper have be threaten with closure because they be report to have insult the king and prime minister . </s>
these paper actively support the opposition politician , Mr Sam Rengie . </s>
legal proceeding have be initiate against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be bring to trial for treason . </s>
in his millennium speech , he dare to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appoint the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death . </s>
in March of last year , a member of Sam Rengie 's party be kill by a group of man in military uniform in the province of Kandal . </s>
in September , two member of the party be arrest because they be report to have be involve in a rocket attack on the prime minister . </s>
this be notably the only party in Cambodia which have no military arm . </s>
in October , a member of parliament belong to the same party be abduct by uniform man and not release until the ransom be pay . </s>
the pattern of intimidation be clear . </s>
There be more go on in Cambodia : prisoner be be torture , the army and police be involve in the trade in woman and child , and people be hold on remand to an excessive degree . </s>
All this be happen on a daily basis . </s>
even more serious be the government 's refusal to bring the leader of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal . </s>
it be true , the civil war in Cambodia be over and political tension have ease . </s>
the way in which the political opposition be now be treat , however , give us cause for great concern and , if it carry on like this , it be bind to impact on the Union 's relation with Cambodia . </s>
Mr President , there be a new doctrine take shape in international law , accord to which no country can treat its citizen or the people live within its territory in any way it like , and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there be gross violation of human right , not even when the government be legally or even democratically elect . </s>
live example of this have be the Pinochet-Ugarten case , Kosovo and , in mild form in our own Union , the debate surround the government decision in Austria . </s>
this be what be at stake now in Cambodia unless the leader of the previous oppressive regime be buy to justice . </s>
at the same time , the struggle against impunity be under threat . </s>
the situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court have be shamefully slow . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , we have an extremely useful debate on human right yesterday . </s>
I be please that we have have this further opportunity to consider a number of area in the world - Kosovo , Angola , Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human right have be a particularly severe challenge . </s>
first of all , on Kosovo , the Commission fully share the concern express in these draft resolution as regard general policy towards Kosovo , as regard the continuing ethnic violence and as regard the prisoner in Serb jail . </s>
our effort in Kosovo , as elsewhere in the wide region , be direct at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation . </s>
in particular we support the development of a free , democratic and multi-ethnic society . </s>
our assistance programme in the field of democratisation and human right should continue to build confidence in general and , in particular , to try to build confidence between the various community . </s>
we have always condemn ethnic violence , no matter which ethnic group be the perpetrator or the victim . </s>
we consider it be unacceptable against Serb and Roma minority as it be against the Kosovar Albanian in the past . </s>
we support the effort of UNMIK , KFOR and the OSCE to establish a function civil administration and to ensure law and order . </s>
in this regard we strongly support the High Representative 's recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officer for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo . </s>
it be a point raise by several speaker in the debate . </s>
I hope it will underline the importance , when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy , of look at the non-military aspect of that policy as well as the military aspect . </s>
it be just as important to have headline goal for our police and institution building as for a military capacity . </s>
we continue to be very concern about the many civilian who be presently hold in Serb prison . </s>
I totally agree with the point put so passionately by the Mrs Pack , either before trial or follow judgement . </s>
the plight of Kosovar Albanian who have be miss since the end of the war be particularly distressing . </s>
we call on everyone , within and outside Kosovo , to support these common aim , to support UNMIK and KFOR in their effort to achieve them . </s>
turn briefly to Angola , we have again a number of knowledgeable speech , especially from Mr Soares , with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject . </s>
the Commission believe strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola . </s>
it be a vital precondition for strengthen democratic institution and civil society . </s>
an area of special concern be the harassment of journalist , include temporary detention of member of the so-called independent press . </s>
the European Union make a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year . </s>
we fully support the work of the UN through UNUA , give its specific responsibility to monitor the human right situation in Angola . </s>
we be also commit to the Security Council 's sanction against UNITA , include arm control . </s>
while maintain emphasis on humanitarian need , the Commission be prepare for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola . </s>
an essential element will be support for democracy and human right , include specific initiative to strengthen democratic institution and civil society . </s>
the European Union have condemn the use of anti-personnel landmine and we be support de-mining operation through an international Ngo . </s>
the resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day be on demining , and particularly the importance of destroy the stock of existing mine : stock in the Ukraine , stock in Moldova and stock elsewhere . </s>
this be a subject which be not give sufficient attention . </s>
on the question of the indigenous people in the US , I be sure that the resolution which be primarily address to the US authority will have be note by them . </s>
our general policy however , be to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society , something we be look at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we be try to develop and which we be discuss with North America . </s>
the Commission share the grow concern about the missing Russian journalist , Mr Babitsky and the condition for the independent medium in Chechnya more generally . </s>
this issue come on top of our deep worry about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya , and I have hear Mr Posselt on this subject before . </s>
There be alarming report of human right violation . </s>
of course , there have be disproportionate use of force in the present conflict . </s>
the Commission delegation in Moscow participate in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month . </s>
we underline our serious concern about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we press the Russians to clarify the circumstance of Mr Babitsky 's detention in view of their obligation in the field of human right . </s>
we await a proper response from the Russians . </s>
in the meantime , the conclusion of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirm the message which I have give today . </s>
and we be ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March , if we need to do so . </s>
finally , on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge : we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leader should be accountable for their crime . </s>
I totally agree with the argument that be put forward by Mr Morillon . </s>
we vigorously support the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year . </s>
the European Union underline its full support for the effort of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leader . </s>
at the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two party . </s>
I be encourage by the optimism of Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of the UN , on the chance of agreement on the propose tribunal . </s>
the Commission will continue to raise issue regard the rule of law , democratic principle and human right with Cambodian authority through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which enter into force on 1 November last year . </s>
it have be useful to debate human right twice in a couple of day . </s>
I hope we have other opportunity , but I hope we will have few example of their abuse in the year ahead . </s>
thank you very much Commissioner Patten . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
the vote will take place at @card@ p. M. Danube environmental disaster the next item be the joint debate on the follow motion for resolution : B5-0164 / @card@ by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , B5-0167 / @card@ by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party , B5-0168 / @card@ by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats , B5-0173 / @card@ by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , B5-0179 / @card@ by Mrs Schroedter and other on behalf of the Group of the green / European Free Alliance on the environmental disaster cause by cyanide leak from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos , Somes , Tisza and Danube Rivers . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the Tisza and Danube Rivers be currently experience an environmental disaster on a huge scale . </s>
live organism in these river have be destroy over many hundred of kilometre and the drinking water for thousand of people be under threat . </s>
the environmental disaster itself be bad enough but , to make matter bad , company , politician and the medium in Romania have seek to deny and prevent news about this incident get out . </s>
when I read that assertion be be make to the effect that this be a conspiracy on the part of their Hungarian neighbour , I realise that now be the time for the European Parliament to make it clear to Romania in no uncertain term that this be not the way we want to behave towards each other in Europe , or how we want to solve problem . </s>
that be not how it work ! </s>
one have to consider the problem , establish the cause and do everything possible to prevent them from recur . </s>
as I see it , two thing have happen here : firstly an international company have be negligent . </s>
if this large vat of cyanide have only a flimsy protective cover then in no way do that accord with the environmental standard we have in Europe and other part of the world . </s>
secondly , there be major loophole in the environmental protection legislation in a country that be in the process of apply to join the European Union . </s>
Three thing need to be do : the European Union must deliver technical and financial aid with all haste , so as to combat this contamination . </s>
this episode have show that not only do we need rapid reaction force in the military sense , we also need them for civil disaster . </s>
secondly , we also need to assist the Romanian in draft new environmental legislation and standard . </s>
thirdly , we need a liability system for environmental damage . </s>
this case demonstrate that environmental protection be part of the acquis communautaire and be one of the condition of entry to our European Union . </s>
Mr President , we debate the framework directive on water this week , and the disaster in Romania have demonstrate once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water . </s>
this disaster have raise a number of important issue which concern us as a European Union . </s>
we be delight with the pledge that Eu aid will be use to clean the river , and at least as important be the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and , more generally , in Central and Eastern Europe . </s>
we therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström 's brief visit , for it can contribute to this awareness . </s>
after all , this be a candidate country we be talk about , and this disaster be in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate country will comply with the Eu environmental rule in time . </s>
the polluter ought to pay . </s>
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboy who appear in the so-called ' Wild East ' , make use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place . </s>
I would be in favour of its do so . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , there have be one ecological disaster after another and , unfortunately , they be all similar . </s>
once again , there be cause for concern at the serious pollution affect the fourth most important wetland in Europe . </s>
the delta of the Danube be in danger . </s>
as in Spain in April @card@ , as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December , once again an exceptional natural site be under serious threat . </s>
the European Parliament be constantly draw attention in its resolution to this sort of danger , which threaten our environment , upset our ecosystem and again weaken our population . </s>
this new disaster raise the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate country . </s>
the authority in these county , which be still very frail from an environmental point of view , need to overcome numerous obstacle . </s>
first , they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equip the most critical industrial site ; then they need to have suitable technical mean of curb and contain this type of pollution and , finally , they need to be able to implement programme to restore the most affect and the most sensitive site . </s>
today , the bank and the water of more than four river cross four country be polluted , which be why the European Union need to concentrate its effort and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate country to come into line with Community environmental protection standard . </s>
but , over and above that , it be the technology and the mean use to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which be be call into question . </s>
I hope that our future partner will demonstrate great responsibility . </s>
the environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent . </s>
it must form the basis for our partner ' political will . </s>
implement high environmental standard will not only allow important industrial and technological sector to develop , it will also have social and economic benefit and , at the same time , public health standard will improve . </s>
the effort already be make need to be step up . </s>
the European continent need to demonstrate solidarity and responsibility must be clearly define on the basis of the ' polluter pay ' principle . </s>
Mr President , when the Doñana disaster occur , the non-governmental organisation , the World Wide Fund for Nature , give us a report on the number of reservoir of this type in Europe . </s>
the number be huge . </s>
they be an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply , ecological wealth and economic future of surround area . </s>
I visit Doñana after the spill and see how agriculture , fishing and the life of people in the surround area be enormously compromise . </s>
I therefore believe that the European Union must , to start with , carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoir and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe . </s>
we must bring these reservoir under Community law and the directive on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event do not happen again . </s>
if we do not , we will be permanently endanger the ecological wealth of our continent . </s>
Mr President , this disaster at the mine in Romania affect a large hydrogeological area with river and watercourse in Romania , Hungary , Serbia and Bulgaria , the fact that @card@ @card@ m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantity of heavy metal have leak out into the ecosystem be go to have appalling consequence for people in the area for a very long time to come , as well as for animal and plant life , agriculture , the tourist industry , biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem . </s>
it be incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happen at all today . </s>
be a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be use in the mining industry and in the production of metal ? </s>
the answer , of course , be an emphatic no . </s>
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide . </s>
I assume , therefore , that the Eu will take the initiative and see to it that there be a total , worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance . </s>
it have already be ban in most Eu country for a long time now . </s>
that an accident like this can happen at all be therefore an extremely shameful state of affair . </s>
I have be inform that the Commissioner for the Environment , Margot Wallström , have travel from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself , on the spot , what have happen . </s>
My Group assume that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those community which have be affect : economic aid , support in term of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which be require . </s>
this highlight the need for something which we in the Group of the green / European Free Alliance have be demand for an extremely long time , namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilian in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophe of this type . </s>
it also shed light upon the low level of environmental requirement in some of the applicant state . </s>
we must demand that there should be no exception which could jeopardise people 's health and the ecosystem . </s>
Mr President , the Commission 's White Paper on environmental liability , which be put forward several day ago - on 9 February to be precise - cite the tanker accident that contaminate and poison the French coast as the most recent incident in the series of environmental disaster cause by human being . </s>
only a few day later we be able to add another terrible environmental disaster to the list . </s>
these episode always spring from the same source , namely inadequate technology and also maximisation of profit , which be evidently prize more highly than the well-being of the environment , and of course the health and well-being of human being . </s>
someone have already mention , in this connection , how vital it be for the European Union to provide both technical and financial aid . </s>
however we must also make it clear to Romania that it can wriggle out of this , but must work hard at fulfill the acquis communautaire . </s>
in addition , I believe it be imperative that we draft and implement a directive on comprehensive environmental liability within the European union with all speed . </s>
Mr President , I do not think we be in a position to throw stone at the eastern European country which have come knock at the door of the European Union , because ecological disaster occur as much here , in the west , as they do in the east . </s>
for example , the overflow from the decant basin at the gold mine in Salsigne , in France , have cause tremendous pollution and be a huge economic disaster even today . </s>
we know full well that pollution and restoration cost run into billion . </s>
who be go to pay ? </s>
which be why the environmental aspect , which be become a matter of urgency , must be take into account in all development project at all cost . </s>
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here , i. e. to call on Member States which still have gold mine to commission expert report , so that we know just what the situation be . </s>
I be think in particular of the gold mine in French Guiana , where the worker , who be generally woman , be exploit and work in absolutely deplorable health condition . </s>
. </s>
let me associate myself , not least as a former Environment Minister , completely and without any reservation whatsoever , with the expression of concern by honourable member . </s>
an objective assessment of the fact be not easy at this stage . </s>
but early report suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos , Tisza , Somes and Danube Rivers be a very serious environmental tragedy . </s>
it have destroy an entire ecosystem in a matter of day . </s>
no live organism , from microbe to otter , have be spare . </s>
several member have set out what seem to have happen . </s>
we have all see some of the consequence on our television screen . </s>
some environmental expert have put the environmental consequence of this disaster , at least so far as damage to the ecosystem be concern , on a par with Chernobyl . </s>
it have affect the people of three country - Romania , Hungary and Yugoslavia . </s>
it be the Tisza , Hungary 's second river , perhaps its most beautiful and most love by its people , that have bear the brunt . </s>
as with all such disaster it be the long-term consequence that be the most pernicious . </s>
some estimate suggest that it could take up to five year to restock the river . </s>
There be a continue threat to other wildlife from eat toxic fish . </s>
we plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can , as rapidly as we can , to help cope with this catastrophe . </s>
that be certainly the view of my colleague , Commissioner Wallström , who I know would have wish to respond to this resolution in person today . </s>
the reason she can do so be because , as some honourable member have point out , she be in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how good we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authority to tackle the crisis . </s>
we stand ready to do so . </s>
we contact the Romanian government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently . </s>
the Romanian have approach UNEF and Ocha , in Geneva , for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of expert . </s>
we stand ready to assist in this assessment if there be a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the site for national of both country can be guarantee . </s>
that be obviously crucial . </s>
it be plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how good to help tackle it . </s>
it be to that end that our effort be now engage . </s>
There be also a need to clarify the legal responsibility of the mining company and of the Romanian authority . </s>
this be an important point , as several speaker have suggest . </s>
the polluter-pays principle be a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy . </s>
it be mirror in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be apply in this case . </s>
the European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payment due . </s>
the Union have mobilise some EUR @card@ million over the past seven year to support protection of the Danube River basin . </s>
in the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we be give under ISPAR and Phare to tackle the most severe impact of this accident , as long as the polluter-pays principle be fully respect . </s>
we will want , in the long term , to see what lesson can be draw from this disaster , above all to see how to prevent such disaster happen in the first place . </s>
the incident reinforce the case for a strengthening of European civil protection , along the line suggest by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggest by one or two member today . </s>
but for now the priority be to cope with this crisis . </s>
as I have say , my colleague , Commissioner Wallström , be on the spot today . </s>
she will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she propose as a result of her visit . </s>
this have be an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe have to respond and do all it can to ensure that incident as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future . </s>
the debate be close . </s>
we shall now proceed to the vote . </s>
vote Mr President , I abstain from voting on company restructuring because , after hope that the Community would intervene on company restructuring , I would like to specifically remind the house that it be indeed true that a thousand people have be leave jobless , deprive of the chance to continue work but , if the States have not delay the official pensionable age - of at least @card@ @card@ people in Italy , who be therefore continue to work and who would otherwise have free up @card@ @card@ job if the law which delay their pensionable age by five year have not intervene - we would not now be look at a figure of one thousand people unemployed : there would now be a thousand employ worker , albeit in another firm , but they would nevertheless have have a job . </s>
. </s>
( FR ) the only reason we vote for the PSE-Verts / ALE-GUE / NGL compromise motion for a resolution be because this resolution allow us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy . </s>
however , the measure set out in this resolution be derisory in term of combat the policy of the major industrial group which be shed job and exacerbate unemployment . </s>
moreover , it be all just word , because the socialist government , which be now in a majority in Europe , be just as incapable of take action to prevent redundancy as right-wing government . </s>
the real problem be not find a legal way of slightly complicate redundancy procedure , but ban them . </s>
the only way of stop the diabolical machine which produce capital gain on the one side and unemployment on the other be to ban redundancy in all large company which be in profit , on pain of compulsory purchase , and to publish the account of large company and subject them to the scrutiny of the worker and the general public . </s>
Society must have the means of enforce its own agenda on large company and their owner . </s>
the first item on that agenda be the eradication of unemployment . </s>
the sum need to create useful job in public service and finance the distribution of work among everyone , without cut wage , must be take from the profit of large company . </s>
it be far more important for the majority of society than the waste involve in financial operation or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholder . </s>
. </s>
( SV ) I can support the present resolution because , in paragraph 8 , an individual factory in Italy be single out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place , while the current management be be advise to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer . </s>
it be not the European Parliament 's business to express an opinion on which factory in the European Union 's @card@ Member States be to remain in place and which be to be shut down ; to expand their work force or reduce them ; stay in the same location or else move ; be sell or not be sell ; and , in the case of those which be to be sell , to comment on whether they be to be sell to company within or outside Europe . </s>
ultimately , it be a question of different sphere of authority , where the European Parliament and its member do not have any legal means of change the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stand . </s>
the Swedish Christian democrat would emphasise the value of the European Union 's and the European Parliament be concentrate on their basic task and not undermine the value of their action in these area by also act in area outside their jurisdiction . </s>
tourism and employment the next item be the report ( A5 ­ @card@ / @card@ ) by Mr Viceconte , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission : ' Enhancing tourism 's potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusion and recommendation of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment ' [ COM ( @card@ ) @card@ - C5-0112 / @card@ - @card@ / @card@ ( Cos ) ] . </s>
, rapporteur . </s>
( it ) Mr President , lady and gentleman , despite the European Union 's delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism , increase attention be be pay to tourism as a sector capable of generate new job . </s>
One of the reason for the Community 's interest be the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market , which explain its attractiveness for woman and young people , to whom it often offer their first experience of employment . </s>
the importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone be now aware of this - be nevertheless base more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical datum . </s>
the fact that , due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical datum , the tourist industry be in effect an unknown quantity have greatly limit the prospect of pursue a consistent policy in this area and create employment on a wide scale . </s>
it would be appropriate , therefore , to begin by summarise the impact of tourism on the life of Union citizen and the desirability , in both economic and social term , of promote the European tourist industry . </s>
firstly , I would remind you that the tourist industry be one of the infrastructure which any advanced society must have . </s>
without it , institution , business and the world of work could not function . </s>
Tourism must therefore be think of as the whole range of good and service require by individual move from their habitual place of residence and thus confer mobility , the characteristic feature of contemporary society . </s>
the term ' tourism ' must no longer be solely perceive as synonymous with sun , sea and holiday , which have the effect of reduce the interest take in the subject at institutional level . </s>
secondly , I would like to explode a myth , take as a start point an apparent paradox , which be clearly highlight by Eurostat figure : the main international tourist country be not those traditionally regard as tourist destination , but on the contrary the most advanced nation , whose quality of life be one of their main attraction and most heavily promote feature . </s>
clearly , the importance of tourism for the economy of region traditionally regard as tourist destination , southern region for example , be very different , and should be study carefully . </s>
it be an obvious truth , and one that be measurable by other economic and social indicator , that thank to tourism , many Mediterranean region have undergo a radical change for the good in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitant , and achieve a drastic reduction in the number emigrate . </s>
social growth have occur only in those area where the tourist market have give rise to the development of all the activity require to meet the need of visit tourist , thus create an entire productive system . </s>
in such case , there be a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist number , thus establish a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy . </s>
this remind us that tourism can be regard as the poor country ' petroleum industry , because it require huge investment in structure , infrastructure , entrepreneurship , professional expertise , social service and training ; that the tourist industry be essential for the equilibrium of many region as it provide a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activity : agriculture , small firm in the industrial and craft sector , transport , service , retail sector , training , etc ; that the development of the Community 's tourist industry be closely link to its sustainability with regard to the Community objective ; that the varied geography and historical , cultural and environmental heritage must be protect and exploit . </s>
in my opinion , the European Union can , in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity , supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidate the potential of tourism by mean of certain measure , such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the treaty ; the adoption of mechanism within the programme and project set up under its regional policy and other policy of the Union , with a view to promote tourism in all its form : rural , environmental , cultural , conference-based , spa-related and sports-related tourism , and also tourism focus on senior citizen , research and training ; the amendment of Directive @card@ / @card@ / EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism ; the cofinancing of project to set up new transport service and infrastructure ; the cofinancing of pilot scheme involve benchmarking and the exchange of experience . </s>
these and other specific measure include in my report can , in my view , lend add value to the action that the competent national and regional authority should foster , in order to promote tourism and create new job , start with the adoption of positive fiscal measure to assist small and medium-sized firm , particularly by reduce the burden of charge on labour . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , I would like to share with you three basic factor which , in my opinion , determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment . </s>
in Europe today , the tourism market contribute @card@ % of the gross national product and occupy a rather significant proportion of the workforce , approximately 6 % . </s>
those figure be incomparably high for some country . </s>
To grasp the importance of tourism for some part of Europe , it be worth point out that in my own country , Greece , a country that attract tourist , over the past four decade , during which the farming population have clearly age and the population be over-concentrated in the major urban centre , the only area which have retain population of low average age or to which young people have return be one where tourism have develop . </s>
it be therefore clear that besides be a matter of general economic interest for Europe , tourism be a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union 's region . </s>
another factor be that the world market be grow explosively . </s>
the forecast be for ten billion tourist in @card@ , but unfortunately for Europe there be a reverse trend . </s>
Europe 's share of the increase be fall drastically each year to the benefit of Asia , the Far East and America . </s>
you see , the world tourism market be influence every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport , its reduce cost , and competition from new centre of tourism outside Europe . </s>
furthermore , @card@ % of business active in tourism be small or medium-sized , the very enterprise which form the live cell of our social and economic tissue , which be call upon to tackle the new obstacle and respond positively to the challenge of this global development . </s>
as the rapporteur say , this become particularly important when tourism be appreciate as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantity of agricultural and industrial product , service and transport and to create a significant amount of added value . </s>
here , then , I want to point out that international competition be tough and , if we be to overcome it positively , we must together envision and share a long-term strategy . </s>
we must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resource engage in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenge of our age . </s>
today , nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technology and system , with Internet at the sharp end , mobile telephone and digital television , be bring about radical change in tourism as a whole and its respective structure and operational model . </s>
the introduction of these new technology be not a threat , but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offer the potential to provide new and innovative tourism product and service , which our tourism need for an ever-lengthening tourism season , so that it can attract new customer and offer new and alternative form of tourism . </s>
the new technology also make it possible to open new market in traditionally undervalued , non tourist area , which could develop to become centre of tourism and attract substantial investment . </s>
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programme of tourism school and training programme for company staff , include programme for train the unemployed and their re-introduction to work . </s>
the Committee on Women 's Rights pay particular attention to the issue of education , because accord to official figure woman account for @card@ % of those engage in tourism service , and in parallel , they form a majority among the working people most easily affect by social and economic change . </s>
we must not forget that people work in tourism , especially woman , encounter particular problem such as seasonal work , the need to renew contract from one year to the next , social protection , lack of interest in continue education , and reduce possibility for development . </s>
we therefore ask the European commission for special measure and to adopt the principle of equal opportunity in all tourism programme and programme for company development . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , we be debate the employment potential of the tourist industry today , which the Commission appear at last to have recognise . </s>
it be important , long overdue , and in fact still do not go far enough . </s>
I can shake off the feeling that we have be go round in circle for year . </s>
thing be certain to be different in future , with the new Commission , although I could have hope for a little more enthusiasm on the part of the competent Commissioner . </s>
I have be personally involve in tourism competence discussion for Europe since the beginning of the 90s . </s>
time after time it be a roller-coaster ride of glimmer of hope one minute - as occur at the Council for tourism and employment in @card@ and disappointment the next - the Council and Commission 's dismissive attitude towards include a tourism article in the Treaty for example . </s>
Many of the thing the Commission offer in its communication by way of follow-up measure to the assessment and recommendation produce by the High level Group for tourism and employment , be not new , for the European Parliament have be make the same demand for year now . </s>
it be just a shame that expert opinion count for more than the view of the member of this Parliament . </s>
particularly when we bear in mind the current , underlie attitude towards Europe prevalent amongst the citizen of the Eu Member States , and the lack of a sense of European identity feel by our people , as Vaclav Havel point out most forcibly yesterday , employment potential be only one side of the tourism coin . </s>
the other side be the potential it have to help build a European sense of identity , which be so important to Europe 's continued existence . </s>
we be still await a communication from the Commission on this . </s>
yes , we must watch out - Europe face fierce competition . </s>
whilst we have experience a @card@ % drop in our world-wide market share over the last few year , south-east Asia , Australia and New Zealand in particular be experience a travel boom . </s>
of the @card@ million new job that be expect to be create worldwide , the World Travel and Tourism Council only expect 2 % of them to be in Europe . </s>
be that not an alarming thought ? </s>
for tourism do not just have an important economic role to play , it also contribute towards international understanding . </s>
any one that truly get to know and understand the country and people of Europe from personal travel experience be simply not go to turn to nationalism at a late stage . </s>
all form of tourism help to build mutual trust and gradually break down prejudice , arrogance , mistrust and scepticism . </s>
they increase people 's willingness to accept one another and counteract what appear to be a decline in tolerance in people 's dealing with one another . </s>
that be precisely why it be in our own interest , whilst adhere strictly to the principle of subsidiarity , to stimulate , coordinate and promote tourism , and to do so by create optimum framework condition and use a reliable database . </s>
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report , which I unreservedly endorse . </s>
let us hope that it be not just a paper exercise , as be the case before . </s>
Mr President , I would like to begin with some word of optimism , which come to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October @card@ , the first page of which say that by the end of the next decade , it would be possible to create between 2 @card@ @card@ e 3 @card@ @card@ new job in tourism activity in the Union . </s>
in addition , it say that this would only happen if the right condition be create . </s>
the Commission and Parliament be call upon to answer two question : what be the right condition and what be the role of the European union on this ? </s>
the Commission and Parliament can help us understand , in the first place , exactly what we be deal with , because even the term ' tourism ' , as be , moreover , point out in the Viceconte report , be still an ambiguous term , a kind of variable that depend on latitude , climate , a range of opportunity , and a series of background factor ; it can be synonymous with holiday or it can be a true area of production , income , wealth and employment . </s>
There be a shortage of fact : we have no information on the economic impact , which still remain a complete mystery . </s>
we have criterion for the gathering and interpretation of statistic which be totally at odd with each other , despite what be say in a @card@ directive by the Commission and Parliament . </s>
with the aim of work out a strategy , it be vital to have a reading of these fact which harmonious and as strict as possible , so that we truly make tourism capable of create job . </s>
this do not follow automatically : often in the past a great deal of wealth have be accumulate thank to the promotion of the tourist industry , without this be match by an increase in employment . </s>
There be no legal basis , and we feel that this be currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector . </s>
a legal basis translate into the ability to formulate strategy , to coordinate and to programme , all vital factor for make European Union tourism competitive with other market . </s>
a legal basis would mean we would avoid have to draw on the structural fund , as be the case in the past , to obtain some loose change . </s>
moreover , only minimal amount be make available to us : we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicate amount total EUR 4 @card@ @card@ @card@ over the last five year , which correspond to the cost of build @card@ kilometre of motorway . </s>
There be no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States : recognise the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union 's competence which at the moment , be only exercise in fit and start . </s>
we fully endorse the Community measure which be recommend in the Commission communication : advantageous taxation , that be , fiscal measure that offer condition that be truly competitive in this market to the production sector - @card@ % of which , I would point out , be make up of small and medium-sized business , which be equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized business in the European tourism sector ; it award special attention to vocational qualification in the European Union , and therefore to invest in training ; finally , it undertake to make the job market transparent . </s>
the tourism market be by definition a flexible market ; we do not want this flexibility to be see in a solely negative light , with seasonal work be misinterpret as illegal work : remember that @card@ % of employment , especially in southern country of the European Union , be do on the black economy . </s>
we feel that the European Union and the Commission need to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism , which mean have a strategy that be compatible with the environment , after the excess of recent year when private wealth often do not correspond to high level of employment . </s>
first and foremost , we need to compete in term of quality . </s>
finally , we consider that tourism can , in addition to be a growth factor , be a factor for democracy , and in this regard we be ask the Commission for a clear , conscious commitment . </s>
Mr President , there be three point I wish to address . </s>
the first be the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty . </s>
this be something I favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own Group . </s>
we be all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economy and as a factor of European integration . </s>
the problem for some of us , however , be the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to consideration of subsidiarity . </s>
second , there be similar issue relate to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism . </s>
the resolution contain many excellent idea for the promotion of different type of tourism and for its increase professionalism . </s>
at the same time the Commission be currently concern about confine itself to core task . </s>
the question have to be ask whether some of the activity suggest in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resource than be desirable . </s>
third , there be several reference in the resolution to permanent employment . </s>
of course the promotion of this be desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment . </s>
but there will always be people who be look for seasonal employment . </s>
student be an obvious example . </s>
we have some concern that the resolution do not give enough consideration to them and to way in which their interest could receive specific protection . </s>
thus , while compliment Mr Viceconte on his report and find a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be ask for a number of split vote to allow these concern to be address . </s>
Mr President , I too believe that tourism have a very important role to play , not just in our European region , but throughout the world , because it be a great asset when it come to economic and social development . </s>
but it be also a very vulnerable sector , as we recently see with the oil slick . </s>
a flourishing tourist sector can be totally wipe out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick . </s>
when it come to tourism , we can no longer do what we like where we like . </s>
There be huge reserve ; certain zone , rural zone , so-called zone lag behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitat , be list as have good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism . </s>
this could be develop and provide a large number of new job . </s>
but these region need to take real account of positive and negative experience in other tourist sector . </s>
we must not kill the goose that lay the golden egg of tourism . </s>
tourism must be environmentally friendly if it be to continue to be an asset in the future . </s>
I can think of many mountain region which be continually spoil in order to develop a tourist sector . </s>
we have stop count the damage and destruction in natural habitat and mountain zone . </s>
I should also like to refer to the dark side of tourism , the tourism export from the Member States of the European Union . </s>
I be refer to sex tourism . </s>
I know that action be be take against this so-called tourism elsewhere , but we must remember the European Union 's responsibility at this level . </s>
under no circumstance can we , as responsible politician , allow what be currently happen to continue , with young girl practically buy in the country of the East and come here to be abuse on the cheap . </s>
finally , I should like to refer to the tourism which give citizen contact with the outside world and democracy . </s>
I be think in particular of country such as Cuba which be isolate but I know , because I have travel there extensively , that the Cubans who come into contact with tourist can learn something of the outside world , obtain different information and pass on different information . </s>
for all these reason , I think that reform the treaty would allow the huge tourist question , which be an important asset for the whole planet , to be properly integrate . </s>
Mr President , lady and gentleman , Mr Viceconte 's report be a very good piece of work in my view and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on it . </s>
he have succeed in set forth in a very lucid manner a field which be broad and difficult to pin down exactly ; that of the economic , social , cultural , sporting and health-related activity in the sphere of tourism in all its many form , take into account the diverse requirement of the Eu Member States . </s>
the difficulty attend dealing with the European dimension of tourism , and the support that the Council , the Commission and Parliament be require to provide , be clearly articulate . </s>
What I consider to be particularly worthy of mention be the approach whereby we be to take our cue from the scale of the economic sector of tourism and its importance in employment term in the Eu , and deduce from this the need to create and apply a Community framework for activity . </s>
irrespective of the stalemate situation vis-à-vis the Council , the Commission should exploit the opportunity which also exist at present to develop element of a European tourism policy . </s>
and these include the following : firstly , establish strategic priority for develop this sector ; secondly , draw up a list of criterion , which will make it possible for specific , tourism-related interest to be take account of in the implementation phase of Eu project within the scope of the various programme ; and thirdly , seek and establish a suitable method for arrive at an interim solution for financing expenditure on coordination with Community measure in other policy area - employment , the environment , structural fund , Community initiative - until such time as a legal basis be adopt . </s>
it be also absolutely vital for the Austrian Council Presidency 's compromise proposal concern the adoption of a multi-annual framework programme to be put into practice as soon as possible . </s>
of course this will mean that those member of the Council who block its adoption will have to be urge in the strong term to think over their rejection of it and change their mind . </s>
at the same time , the European Commission , as well as the Member States , could , and should , integrate the development of policy guideline for the tourism sector into the draft of a framework programme , or the two should be pursue in tandem . </s>
the Commission must make it its business to analyse the various national regulation and activity and extrapolate generalisation for the Eu area on this basis . </s>
these can , and will , form a sound basis for the draft of the Eu framework condition . </s>
in view of its enormous employment potential , it be precisely the economically under-developed , or problem , region of the Eu that tourism will have an impact on in term of stimulate local economic activity - agriculture , handicraft , service , transport , trade , as well as education . </s>
in other word , it will be possible to set up regional economic cycle . </s>
it be extremely important , in this respect , to make the sustainability of measure and the protection of natural habitat in our environment our guiding principle . </s>
small and medium-sized company offer tourist service be perfectly suit to this , for they ensure that vacation and leisure facility , health cure establishment and sporting activity be adapt in a harmonious manner to the natural environment . </s>
other aspect , such as the observation of non-discriminatory practice at the work place , which constitute a general principle to be apply in the implementation of Community policy , must be firmly establish in the measure for support tourism in the various Eu programme . </s>
at the same time , special attention must be give to the specific issue of the high proportion of woman employ , foreign and part-time worker , and appropriate assistance activity must be support . </s>
experience gain in the German Bundesland Brandenburg - where I come from , and which be one of the objective 1 region of course - demonstrate that not only do targeted assistance for small tourist enterprise preserve or create job , it also enable substantial progress to be make in the development of rural area by promote green tourism , for example take conservation area into account . </s>
and Eu fund have also make a considerable contribution to this in the past . </s>
Mr President , during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I be pleasantly surprise . </s>
the opinion of Mr Sánchez García , address to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , contain a remark regard the IGC . </s>
the draftsman of the opinion hold the view that there be no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty . </s>
this be in contrast to the majority opinion hold in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . </s>
have hear many member who share the view express in the opinion , this be a real relief . </s>
unfortunately , his text have not survive the vote . </s>
it do , however , support my view that I be not , apparently , the only one who can agree with the majority opinion . </s>
this bring me to the content of the report . </s>
an important aspect of the tourism industry be employment and potential employment . </s>
especially in the southern Member States , the tourist industry be a major source of income . </s>
from this vantage point , there be every reason for the government to formulate stimulate measure and a stimulating policy . </s>
the seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuation that this entail also deserve attention . </s>
I be surprise , however , at the fact that many want to achieve this by mean of Community policy . </s>
this be not desirable , either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment . </s>
the discrepancy between the different region can often be trace back to cultural or historical factor . </s>
within these region , a huge range of problem have their part to play . </s>
it be obvious that mainly local and regional - and , therefore , to a lesser extent national - authority be well place to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy . </s>
for this reason , I can therefore endorse the transfer of power to European level . </s>
in addition , employment policy in general be also a factor . </s>
here too , the structure of the economy differ for each Member State , and the way in which the current status have be achieve be diverse . </s>
it will not do for one type of policy , probably with many exception and adaptation , to be apply . </s>
this would mean that the Eu would unjustly be remove task from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervene unnecessarily . </s>
it be preferable for Member States to take measure to stimulate employment themselves . </s>
their expertise , be , of course , superior to that of the Commission . </s>
this be why I be very hesitant when it come to formulate Community measure to promote employment . </s>
even in the tourism industry . </s>
it would really be a nuisance if Parliament be to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extend its power . </s>
Mr President , you will understand that we can assent to the present resolution as it stand . </s>
first of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he have do on this report . </s>
it be a very extensive report . </s>
we greatly welcome it , just as we welcome the original report that it be base on , the report of the high-level working group which be set up by the European Commission . </s>
I hope that the Commission will not forget that . </s>
have set it up , I hope the Commission actually make use of it and therefore do not just allow it to sit around in the corridor and gather dust . </s>
tourism be basically small business and therefore a very fertile area for job creation . </s>
as have already be say in this debate , three million potential new job within the next ten year be something well worth go for . </s>
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in term of policy-making - that the fast grow sector of its economy deserve because of its economic and social position . </s>
we need a more dynamic vision base on tourism 's contribution to job creation . </s>
we must recognise a sector that be predominantly engage in cross-border activity and therefore deserve a European policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development . </s>
I know the Commissioner be very keen on information technology . </s>
he have convince me of that . </s>
but his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together . </s>
There be several reason why the tourism industry be an ideal test-bed , therefore , for integrate job creation strategy . </s>
let us look at some of these reason . </s>
the importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential be obviously one . </s>
various sector of the population be employ by the tourism industry , particularly the more vulnerable group , such as young people , woman and the unskilled . </s>
I be not say that we do not need to raise the skill within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the job establish first . </s>
the availability of unskilled , temporary and seasonal work be very important in some of the economic area of the Community . </s>
Tourism contribute to regional development - in rural area that be maybe try to diversify - and tourism contribute to urban area that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage . </s>
if we take all these aspect together we have the potential of really do something in Europe and maybe extend the tourism season by staggering holiday right across Europe . </s>
we must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitor who come to Europe 's shore to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that have not be open up to the world for quite a number of year - in fact , about forty year . </s>
we be lose market share . </s>
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive . </s>
I hope you will help us . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , today we be address a very important sector that directly involve over @card@ million job in the European Union and help the more or less disadvantaged , island and remote area to stand on their own foot . </s>
and of course , tourism create more job and contribute to the stimulation of employment , especially among society be more sensitive section : woman and young people . </s>
in view of all this , I think it be a serious contradiction that there be no European policy on tourism . </s>
the lack of any legal base make it impossible to adopt measure relate to the sector . </s>
the occasional application of Article @card@ - formerly Article @card@ - which require unanimity , have prevent the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five year and @card@ Member States . </s>
the measure take from time to time in the past have be fragmentary and therefore ineffective , and such provision as have be make be dictate by parallel policy such as consumer protection , environmental policy , transport policy , taxation policy , etc . </s>
, which very often be not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult , since their introduction have usually entail cost for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentive to cope with them . </s>
with sorrow , I stress that in the context of restructure the Commission 's service , tourism be deal with by a section , not even a directorate , within the Directorate-General for ' Enterprise ' . </s>
but we must support our tourism ! </s>
in our view , the axe which could create a basis for its support be : the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector , the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturb the operation of the tourism market , coordination of the tourism policy with other , parallel Community policy which affect it directly or indirectly , a study of the sector , and the adoption of medium and long-term measure to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , since the issue of employment have be raise , I want to recall another issue which be also very serious , namely the bankruptcy among Tour Operators and their consequence mainly for hotel , which be small or medium enterprise lack the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partner be trustworthy . </s>
clearly it be impossible to adopt measure at the national level . </s>
in contrast , at European level it would be possible to look into measure for improve the relation between hotel and Tour Operators , for example a regulation of such relation , the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund , etc . </s>
, in collaboration with representative from the two branch . </s>
in the past , the Commission have request quantitative record of the loss incur by company because of such bankruptcy , so that it could form an opinion , and ask the European confederation of hotel-and-restaurant owner and tourist agency , HOTREC and ECTAA , to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relation between them . </s>
since then , however , there have be no progress . </s>
There must therefore be measure to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe 's tourism and , to the extent of the possible , safeguard the operation of company . </s>
such measure must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural asset and of the tourism infrastructure , so contribute to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism . </s>
I will end by congratulate Mr Viceconte and , as one who come from Crete , a tourist area , I ask that we should always view tourism not only in term of pleasant holiday but as a primary job creator in a Europe which need those job . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , the new attitude adopt recently by the Commission on this important economic activity be strike to those of us who , in recent year , have keep an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework . </s>
we all know that this change of heart be basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment . </s>
it be also due to the recognition by the European Union , since the @card@ conference on these issue , of the enormous potential , represent by tourism , for employment . </s>
in this respect the Commission communication before us today be opportune , as be the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate . </s>
this report contain @card@ conclusion , include @card@ call to the Commission to adopt specific measure and action without forget the environmental dimension and cultural protection , particularly in outermost and island region . </s>
it also contain four call to the Member state which highlight the need to coordinate action with the regional authority and the establishment of measure favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs , particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instrument . </s>
these would encourage the growth of employment in sector which use labour intensively , such as the tourist sector . </s>
finally , once this legal basis to which many of us aspire have be establish so that a common tourism policy can be develop , we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment , as propose by the Commission with the support of this House . </s>
in this strategy , young people and woman , training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by thank Mr Viceconte for his report , which have draw our attention to a sector which be all too often underestimate . </s>
Tourism be a social , economic and cultural phenomenon which affect most European citizen , either as the recipient or the provider of a wide variety of service . </s>
every year , nearly @card@ million Europeans leave their home for a short time in order to travel , usually to other country in Europe . </s>
moreover , Europe be still the main destination for tourist from third country , even though it face increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of product . </s>
since the treaty contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy , the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offer in term of employment . </s>
vocational training and a mobile workforce be important tool in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially , as far as tourist service provider be concern , in meeting multicultural demand and ensure that service be tailor to customer . </s>
employment in the tourism sector be often highly seasonal and precarious , thereby hamper its sustainable development . </s>
it be therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skill in order to promote new mean of production and a supply of tourism which reflect market development as closely as possible . </s>
as the report note , the adoption by the Member States of tax incentive for SMEs in order to reduce labour cost would be an excellent way of promote growth in employment in labour-intensive sector and , consequently , in the tourism sector . </s>
this sector of activity be also a decide factor in the economic and social development of less favour region , especially the most remote and island region , which have undisputed asset in this area . </s>
let us not forget that , in the most remote region , tourism be the most important industry in term of income . </s>
the income and employment generate by tourism help enormously in reduce imbalance and encourage their economy to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community . </s>
in addition , tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement , insofar as it make us more aware of other European culture and thus help respect for European way of life to develop . </s>
it go without say , therefore , that tourism , develop rationally in the long term , should represent a sustainable source of income for local economy , while safeguard and enhance the value of the rural , cultural , historical and environmental heritage . </s>
I should like to close by stress the essential role which the European Union should play in promote new form of tourism in new place which will allow continental European to discover the most far-flung destination in Europe , namely the most remote region . </s>
Mr President , we be have a major debate on a text of very little substance . </s>
the basic document be really no more than a Commission communication which embrace the conclusion and recommendation of a high level group on tourism and employment . </s>
not only be there very little substance but this be also a rather old document date from @card@ April @card@ which therefore make it nearly a year old . </s>
this document stem from the previous Commission . </s>
it be undoubtedly the result of work carry out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminate in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme . </s>
I believe this be the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , who be of course listen very closely to what we be discuss . </s>
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of question directly . </s>
firstly , the government make a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of @card@ to include a legal basis for this issue in the treaty . </s>
this commitment be not fulfill in the Treaty of Amsterdam of @card@ and be therefore outstanding . </s>
yet there be a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment . </s>
What expectation do the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental conference which be start will include this aspect ? </s>
my second question be much more direct and perhaps more awkward . </s>
bear in mind the fail effort of the last decade , as highlight by Mr Koch , do Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism become a proper policy , give the importance that all the previous speaker have give to tourism in term of employment ? </s>
Will the Commission present new initiative in order to see whether , through the constant effort of the Commission and Parliament , we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue ? </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Viceconte , who speak at such length on the tangible possibility , for the fifteen Member States of the Union , of create job by way of a sensible policy , a sensible European Union initiative in this field . </s>
this very afternoon we have have a debate on worker who suddenly find themselves unemployed . </s>
we now hope to be able to solve these problem . </s>
Tourism be an activity that fall decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union . </s>
All the European States be know throughout the world for be tourist magnet envy by all , include the United States of America , which we speak about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans . </s>
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support , and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before give a favourable response . </s>
it regard tourism for senior citizen . </s>
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tear her hair out , bit by bit , because the elderly live too long , lead to problem with pension payment . </s>
however , in this case , the fact that we be live longer mean that there be more senior citizen . </s>
unfortunately not all , but many of them travel the world to see its marvel and to discover and learn more about it : Italian want to see what the English be like , the Greeks want to see what the Turks be like and the French want to see their Italian cousin . </s>
Tourism bring the people of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together , and of course , it lead to peace and understanding . </s>
this kind of tourism , which be undertake mainly by large number of senior citizen , be just as important . </s>
this type of tourism must be promote and support because it allow people to work in tourist destination , not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea , for example , but also during winter when we go to take the air . </s>
Senior citizen be always on holiday , all year round , from 1 January through to @card@ December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year . </s>
unfortunately , this be not true of them all , but this be why I be call on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report . </s>
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , on the one hand we have hear prediction to the effect that by the year @card@ , tourism will have create an additional @card@ million job . </s>
on the other hand , we be aware that in practically all develop country there be a lack of manpower in the tourism sector , which can be completely overcome , even in time of high unemployment . </s>
this contradiction apply when we talk in term of the tourism labour market have two side to it . </s>
on the one hand , tourism provide job in region where there be a severe shortage of other job in trade , industry and agriculture , or the number of job be decline ; it offer employment opportunity to those population group who can find work in other sector on account of a lack of qualification , or technical and global development , and , in particular , tourism enable many young people to get a foot on the ladder of work life . </s>
as such , the tourism sector offer employment policy a ray of hope . </s>
however , we can also see that there be many lamentable disadvantage to work in this sector : long work day and large amount of overtime , work at weekend , on public holiday and during the holiday season , none of which be conducive to people spend quality time with their family . </s>
add to this seasonal unemployment , physically demand workload on account of unhealthy work condition and time of peak demand , and a lack of promotion prospect . </s>
we should focus exclusively on all the tension at work here , leave no stone unturned . </s>
in my country , Austria , tourism and the leisure industry be of central importance to the national economy , contribute as they do to income and job security , as well as to the balance of payment . </s>
in @card@ alone , total income from tourism and leisure activity be @card@ billion Schilling . </s>
the net product share of the overall sector be around @card@ % . </s>
I would therefore like to extend sincere thank to all those who work in tourism , as well as all those who work to conserve nature , culture and recreational area . </s>
I would urge that we exploit the possibility of work time arrangement with a view to shorten period of unemployment , and that we undertake a subtly differentiate analysis of the labour market in the tourism sector . </s>
we need a European marketing strategy , bear in mind the competition we face from other continent . </s>
in the course of our deliberation we must also analyse price structuring , as a result of which it be cheap to fly to America these day than it be to fly from Vienna to Brussels . </s>
training have be mention and a great deal else besides , but there be still a great deal to do if we be to provide a really firm basis for this growth industry and ensure that this be what it continue to be . </s>
Mr President , nine million job today , twelve million in ten year . </s>
Tourism be a wellspring of job in Europe yet we still do not have reliable statistic enable us to identify the different employment sector . </s>
There be no far-sighted support measure and nor be we concentrate on small and medium-sized enterprise . </s>
since we be a long way off have a knowledge-based strategy it be little wonder that that there be a lack of awareness of Community dimension . </s>
I have never understand how certain Member States could boycott the Philoxenia programme when in fact this initiative be design to unite tourism , environmental and cultural concern . </s>
hence I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen if he intend to give this programme any chance at all . </s>
Tourism simply do not feature in most national action plan for the transposition of our common European employment strategy . </s>
I be able to demonstrate that there be a great deal of potential here in my report on future job , which the European Parliament adopt here almost exactly a year ago . </s>
the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs expressly include element of this paper in its position . </s>
Tourism , history , education , sport , health , ecology and rural development produce considerable synergistic effect . </s>
by improve infrastructure measure , conserve our cultural heritage , nurture regional tradition , and offer local product , it will be possible to enhance the appeal of even the most out-of-the-way region . </s>
those who stand to benefit on the job creation front include tourist industry worker , marketing and software expert , environmental consultant and those in charge of target group undertake enquiry . </s>
it be easy for jobseekers and those with few qualification to find work in tourism . </s>
it be usually easy to combine a working and family life . </s>
nevertheless , part-time and seasonal job carry with them the risk of unregulated and unsecured work condition . </s>
the dialogue with the two side of industry , as well as with local authority , must be step up . </s>
therefore , whilst quantity of staff be important on the tourist industry front , so too be quality , which can be consolidate and enhance by mean of further vocational training . </s>
people can be train in communication skill and creativity . </s>
team spiritedness , a sense of responsibility and management know how can be achieve . </s>
Multilingualism and a capacity for empathy with foreign culture will enable people to gain a good understanding of our community . </s>
which be why it be all the more important for us to create stable foundation for a European approach , whilst always uphold the principle of subsidiarity of course . </s>
in my view , this include have certificate of qualification , i. e. diploma that be recognise by all Member States . </s>
we need to set the scene for this . </s>
therefore , there be a lot to be say for tourism as a drive force in employment and integration . </s>
more than any other sector , it be tourism that bring home to us the fact that , ultimately , the big , wide world be a global village . </s>
. </s>
Mr President , I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report . </s>
I think we all acknowledge the economic , social and environmental importance of tourism in today 's developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment . </s>
I be glad to see that the Commission and Parliament be converge towards the same goal in this area . </s>
employment issue be at present the core concern regard tourism . </s>
an essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect be that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partner be as fruitful as possible . </s>
this will determine the success of our work . </s>
certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policy . </s>
this will also be important with a view to the special summit in March , where tourism be bind to be mention as a significant contributor to employment . </s>
coordination of Community tourism activity with other important issue such as regional policy , transport , employment , environment , culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself . </s>
as far as specific policy be concern , I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focus - regional policy . </s>
the Commission guideline document for the new structural fund 's programming period have already identify tourism as one of the area with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprise . </s>
the Commission expect Member States to put increase emphasis on tourism measure in their plan and programming . </s>
quality , sustainability , innovation be at the forefront of the Commission 's own policy and be priority recognise by the Council of Ministers . </s>
quality product in order to improve competitiveness , sustainability in order to protect resource and innovation in particular through the use of information technology . </s>
regard sustainability indicator , the European Environment Agency be already work with the Commission on the issue . </s>
I want to mention , as have already be mention by many speaker today , that tourism relate to the natural and cultural heritage be expect to be the fast expand form of tourism in the Eu during the next two decade . </s>
these possibility should be fully exploit . </s>
Mr Provan say that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology . </s>
I be personally convince that information and communication technology will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism . </s>
the travel and tourism sector be the front-runner in make use of ICT tool . </s>
this will dramatically change the way it operate . </s>
marketing , reservation and transport be expect to be the area of profound change and improvement . </s>
use of ICT open a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism . </s>
direct business to consumer contact will supplement , and sometimes also reduce , the currently , nearly exclusive business to business relationship . </s>
it will give more and good choice to tourist and generate new and good tourist product . </s>
for the Commission this require that action in the tourism field must be tightly link to measure promote the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry , in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programme which be both within my competence . </s>
the new strategy outline by the Commission communication on tourism and employment , and agree by the Council , place the emphasis on tourism gather and disseminate information and good practice . </s>
the implementation of the directive on statistic aim at improve the knowledge of market structure and trend in European tourism and its industry . </s>
Commission decision have advance the methodological approach . </s>
the report on the experience acquire in the work carry out under this directive be part of our work programme for the current year . </s>
more work on the social and economic impact of tourism be currently on-going with the international organisation , such as the World Tourism Organisation . </s>
the European Community 's prime role be to ensure a framework which enable and encourage stakeholder and authority at all level to optimise and realise the tourism sector 's potential for growth and employment . </s>
such a European strategy will be achieve through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority area : exchange and dissemination of information , notably through new technology ; training in order to upgrade skill , quality of tourist product and sustainable development in tourism . </s>
in the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress make in this respect . </s>
a report on the work to be undertake , together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two year from now . </s>
depend on the result of this work , a wide debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiative . </s>
Mr Medina Ortega ask me some very concrete question . </s>
as regard the role of tourism policy in the community concern , we must understand that many policy sector have a huge impact on the framework on tourism . </s>
it be not only the targeted , specific tourism action which be important but the other horizontal action in the field of transport . </s>
at the moment , the question of congestion of air and road be the fundamental problem . </s>
in the area of environment , we be look at way to cooperate with Mrs Wallström ; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier be give a lot of attention to this sector . </s>
we need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which cover all the policy . </s>
I be sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have have a good high-level work group report , your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector be part of enterprise policy . </s>

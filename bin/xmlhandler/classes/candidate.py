        A MWE candidate is a sequence of words extracted from the corpus. The
        sequence of words has a base form ngram (generally lemmas) and a list of
        occurrence ngrams. Features may me added to the candidate, such as 
        Association Measures. The candidate also might be evaluated as a True
        Positive according to several gold standards (references) so it also 
        contains a list of TP judgements.

           occurrences of this candidate. It is possible to find different
           occurrences when, for instance, several inflections are employed to
           a verb inside the candidate, but all these inflections correspond to
           a single lemma or base form of the verb.

           sense of Machine Learning features. A feature is a pair name-value

           the candidate. It can correspond, for example, to a list of human
           judgements about it being or not a MWT. The class is probably boolean
           but multiclass values are allowed, as long as the concerned machine
           learning algorithm can deal with it.
